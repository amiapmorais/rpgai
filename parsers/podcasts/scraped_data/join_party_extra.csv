Unsleeping Party with Brennan Lee Mulligan
Amanda McLoughlin December 22, 2020 One-Shots","Let’s take the lightrail down from LTC to NYC, the city that never sleeps, BABYEEEEE. Dimension 20’s own Brennan Lee Mulligan lets us play around in the Dreaming and Waking worlds of the Unsleeping City, as we look at what two rivals in an urban fantasy sports league might look like. As always, what seems to be about sports is actually about stardom, drama, and lots of New York City references.

SLaM Comics #2 (HALLOWEEN NO CAPES One Shot)
Join The Party October 27, 2020 One-Shots","I'm Vincent Price, or I'm the employee at Tragic the Gathering who has the best Vincent Price impression. It's Halloween here in Lake Town City, when all the monsters come out with one last hurrah before they pull on their winter coats for the next six months. The ""Great Masque of the Read Death"" party is happening in the backroom of Tragic. But, you know, “Red” isn't the color, it's the past tense of “read.”
And the proprietors have a special edition book for everyone's gift bag at the party: a partially canonical edition of SLaM: the adventures of Moxie, Agent Smith and Futureproof. This is issue #11.5 - ""When the Devil Knocks on the Door, Let The Heroes Answer It!""

Transcript
Amanda: Do you know how sometimes you have a friend who texts you? And is like, “Hey, I'm just in a pinch. Can you help me out?” And you're like, “Of course, man. Like, can I bring over some Gatorade? I'm sorry you have the flu. Like, can I, you know, bring you any takeout, because you're under deadline right now? Or, you know, my plants need watering. And I'd love to help you out.” And then, sometimes it's Mothman at your door, and he needs to crash there. And then three weeks go by and he hasn't left?
Lauren: Mhmm.
Eric: Yes. That is something that I dealt with. Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah, happens to me all the time.
Eric: For sure.
Brandon: No, Amanda, that's a wild story you just wove.
Amanda: Well, thanks to Paul Matijevic, who made this wonderful one page RPG, “Ah, Dang! Mothman won't move out. He said it was just for the weekend.” That's what we're gonna be playing today.
(Players yell affirmatively)
Eric: Yay.
Brandon: Yay.
Lauren: Yay.
Eric: Mothman party!
Lauren: Oh, dang!
Eric: Mothman party!
Brandon: Yeah, one party that he wouldn't leave.
Amanda: Every—
Eric: Yes. We had the party. And then he’s like, “Oh, I'm just gonna sleep it off,” and then he never left.
Amanda: Every day is a party when Mothman is your roommate. That’s I want to be very clear.
Amanda: Welcome Briggon Snow. Lauren Shippen, welcome to the show. Thanks for playing with us.
Briggon: Nice.
Lauren: Hello. Thank you for having us.
Amanda: Well, this is the story of how Mothman came to live with all four of you, roommates, and, hopefully, how you helped him to move on with his life. So, our idea here is that we have to help Mothman fix his problems because he has many problems. And that is why he was crashing with his friends. So, we know that Mothman showed up about three weeks ago. And we need to know who all of you are and also where you live and what dope things your house has. So, why don't we start with Eric? Tell us about your character.
Eric: Sure. So, the way that we're supposed to pick this is we have to give ourselves a role. And then we have to write down two things that we're good at. And then we write down our name and what they could be doing right now if not for Mothman. So, my character's name is Octavio Redwine. I’m a 43-year-old Shakespearean actor who is playing the role of an Everyman in order – for a new play that I'm going to be in. So, you, three, may know me as Drew – as Drew Everyman, because I forgot to come up with a name. But, when you – I feel like I'm the newest roommate. And you're like, “So, what's your name? What's your deal? I'm like, “Ah,” and I saw—
Lauren: You look over their shoulder and there's—
Eric: There’s a Mountain Dew bottle.
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric: And I'm like Mountain Dew! I mean Mountain Drew Everyman.
Amanda: He's really into mountains.
Eric: So, I don't know. We could talk about whether or not you, three, know if I'm – if I’m a 43-year-old man or I'm just like your, your regular roommate. So, my two things that Drew is good at is driving RC cars and Netflix. But Octavio Redwine is good at Shakespeare and knowing famous people. And what I could be doing right now is running lines with Anthony Hopkins on Celebrity Skype, which is Skype for Celebrities. But I mean – I mean listening to rock on my free Spotify account.
Amanda: Excellent. So, the, the mechanic here is that you have two things that you're good at. Kind of like proficiencies in D&D. And, if you are trying to do something that makes use of your talents, then you get some extra help in rolling for those outcomes. So, Eric, I think I'll say that you have to be using Drew's terrible skills unless you want to break your cover—
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: – and come forth as Octavio. And then you can make use of Octavio’s 43 years of experience and skills.
Eric: I just went to the Royal Shakespeare Academy. And then I immediately just keep doing Shakespeare. That's all I'm good at. Yeah. I guess my question is do any of you, there – and we can address this, I think, as it's going. Do any of you, three, know that I am Octavio or I'm just Drew, your roommate from I would say maybe like six months ago. I don't know.
Brandon: I think I – we don't – I don't know that you're—
Briggon: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah. I don’t – I don’t think I know.
Brandon: – Octavio, but I, I do have a poster of you on my wall as my favorite Shakespearean. Yeah.
Eric: Okay. Okay. I'll be Drew unless I break the façade.
Brandon: I’m just sitting above the bed.
Amanda: And, and, Eric, what's your role in the group at large?
Eric: So, I think that this is more like I’m Mist– you know when you have a roommate that you just don't know anything about?
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric: Like, they're nice. But, yeah, they’re—
Amanda: The hot one who has the leather jacket.
Eric: No, no, not even. Just like—
Brandon: Just got glimpses of Amanda’s life here.
Eric: I remember that one.
Amanda: Brandon, it's that I want to be that one.
Brandon: Oh, really?
Amanda: But none of my leather jackets fit me.
Eric: No, I think that he's just like the roommate that you don't know anything about. So, I wrote down, like, mysterious, or oddball, or weirdo, but then, of course, normal guy. So, I guess, like, in the – in the function, it’s, like, the stranger who you got off of Craigslist. And it’s, like, he's nice. He's fine. He's clean. But you just like don't know anything about it if that fits.
Lauren: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah
Lauren: Yeah, totally.
Amanda: Great. So, Brandon, speaking of, we know your character’s favorite Shakespearean actor.
Brandon: We do.
Amanda: We all have one.
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: So, I'm glad that we know that right upfront. So, who are you?
Brandon: My name is Joel.
Eric: Hi, Joel.
Brandon: My role is dad.
Amanda: Cool. Cool.
Brandon: And, apparently, I love Shakespearean actors. And my two proficiencies, my two things, I'm really good at shooting hoops with the kids!
Amanda: Great! You gotta have one.
Eric: Wait. Wait a second. So, you're not good at basketball.
Brandon: No.
Eric: You're good with – at playing basketball with people who are younger so that everyone has fun?
Brandon: Yeah, I'm really good at explaining the rules of Horse to children.
Eric: Great. Great.
Amanda: And, again, you guys selected these for strategy.
Brandon: Yes.
Lauren: No.
Amanda: I am so glad to hear this.
Brandon: 100 percent. Yep.
Amanda: What’s the second one?
Brandon: Driving responsibly.
Eric: Oh, that's actually a good one.
Amanda: That's actually a good one. I retract it. Good job right now.
Brandon: Yes, in my ‘86 brown Station Wagon.
Eric: Nice.
Briggon: Ooh.
Brandon: It's got like leather interiors.
Amanda: Do we have like the fake wood exterior or just a – just a solid brown color?
Brandon: It's like a stripped fake wood.
Lauren: Right. Yeah. The belts. Very nice.
Eric: Yeah.
Briggon: Does it have a seat in the trunk that looks at the back that you can seat in?
Brandon: Yeah, of course.
Lauren: Yeah. Oh, my god. It’s so good.
Eric: So dangerous.
Amanda: So dangerous.
Lauren: Sweet and sour.
Briggon: Thanks.
Amanda: So good.
Lauren: It’s the best.
Brandon: No, there's no sweet and sour in my car.
Lauren: (Gasp) Wow!
Amanda: What’s sweet and sour?
Lauren: Sweet and sour, where you wave at the person – if you're sitting backwards, you wave the driver in the car behind you. And, if they wave back, they're sweet. And, if they don't, they're sour.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: And then what are the consequences for being that person?
Lauren: You get—
Briggon: Judgment.
Lauren: Yeah. You get made fun by kids in the backseat of a car that you don't know about, because you can't hear what they’re saying.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. Very good. I think having kids on a bus make weird faces at me and like make fun of me is still my greatest fear.
Lauren: Absolutely. Yeah.
Brandon: Oh, absolutely.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah.
Brandon: You just don't look. You just keep your head straight forward—
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: – when you see a bus pull up.
Lauren: Anytime I'm near a group of teens that is laughing, there are still that ingrained fear if they are laughing at me.
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Briggon: Yeah.
Lauren: I don't – Yeah. A group of teens are scary.
Briggon: I think I want to change my posture. Like, I want to be cool.
Lauren: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Briggon: It’s not gonna happen.
Brandon: What is the cool posture, Briggon?
Briggon: Just sort of like leaning while listening to Broadway show tunes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Briggon: I don't know. My, my mom said – my mom said that straight posture is the coolest posture. So, that’s what I’m doing.
Brandon: And then, finally, the thing that I'd be doing if it weren't for Mothman—
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: – is I'd be fixing the leaky sink in the guest room, god dang it!
Eric: We have two bathrooms? Fuck, yeah!. Alright!
Briggon: This is nice.
Eric: Really guest room?
Lauren: People I have—
Amanda: Excellent.
Briggon: Well, we have four people in the house.
Eric: Yeah. Alright.
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: Please – Joel, please fix the sink in my bathroom.
Brandon: Are you – okay. I’ll go the thing.
Eric: Oh, thank you. I’m Drew, your new roommate.
Lauren: That was a close one.
Amanda: Every morning, you look at him and, like, your, your head goes a little to the side, and you're like, “I really know you from somewhere.”
Lauren: He’s got one of those faces.
Amanda: Great, Lauren.
Lauren: I am Quincy. I am the, the brawn of the group. I’m a large strong man.
Briggon: Yes!
Eric: No, but Lauren, tell what your character is.
Lauren: And my proficiencies are weightlifting.
Amanda: Great.
Lauren: Which I think might actually be, be useful. I spent a lot of time in the gym. And then, also, Quincy loves model trains. So, I’m making model trains and model train villages. If Mothman weren’t in here and I not having to deal with this problem, I would be painstakingly painting a Swiss village for my new train set.
Eric: Hell, yeah.
Amanda: Beautiful.
Briggon: Wow.
Lauren: Yeah.
Brandon: Really highs and lows there.
Lauren: Yeah, real attention to detail.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: And, yet, you know, loves lifting heavy things. Real – you know, people are—
Brandon: Every time an Amazon package comes, Quincy is right there!
Eric: A real man—
Lauren: But it something heavy or a little tiny train.
Amanda: And have you and Drew bonded about his love of driving RC cars and your model trains? Because you're a real synergy that's possible here.
Lauren: I think – I think there's some – I think there's some dancing, dancing around it, you know?
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Lauren: Just like Drew's pretty quiet, and I'm pretty quiet. And, so, we're trying to like feel each other out a little bit, but I think – I think the potential is there for real friendship.
Brandon: What do the conductors – I assume they're called conductors, people who like trains.
Lauren: Yes.
Brandon: What do they feel about RC cars? Are they like low – is like high/low situation? Is train a high?
Lauren: Okay. What is an RC car? I don't—
Brandon: What?
Briggon: A remote control car.
Eric: A remote control car.
Lauren: Oh, remote control. Okay.
Eric: Yeah. Yeah.
Lauren: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I was trying to guess and, and I don't know.
Eric: It was also like – I also had the thought of like stock cars. Like, you have to go to one of those places to drive cars. Do you know what I'm talking about?
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Like a hobby shop.
Eric: Yeah, it's like a hobby shop.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: But it was like, really big and had tracks on it. So, it’s going to be like RC is like you could just drive it wherever, but maybe it's like stock cars.
Lauren: Mhmm.
Eric: Yeah. So, it's more like hobbyist. So, I don't do it in the house.
Lauren: I think the, the unpredictability of the – of the cars, freaks, freaks me out a little bit, you know.
Brandon: Yeah.
Lauren: And the best thing about the trains is you get to program them.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: There are tracks. You kind of know when we're going – when one is going to arrive.
Amanda: Exactly.
Lauren: Because trains always run on time.
Eric: Right.
Amanda: Lauren, did you also, when playing with dolls as a kid, just not have any conflict. And they just tried on outfits and were happy together.
Lauren: Oh, no. There was a lot of drama.
Amanda: Oh, really?
Lauren: Yeah. Yeah. But, like – but full like governmental.
Briggon: Murder.
Lauren: There's a lot of bureaucracy in my – in my childhood. Like, there were a lot of different – everybody had a different job. And, so—
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: – there was a lot of like political drama.
Amanda: Nice.
Lauren: Yeah.
Briggon: One of your dolls is filibustered for an entire evening.
Lauren: Listen, I’m not gonna say that that never happened. But you can't prove that it did unless you talk to my sister.
Amanda: Extremely good. Briggon.
Briggon: Hi.
Amanda: Who are you?
Briggon: I am Mannheim, Mannheim Steamroller. You can call me, Manny.
Brandon: Can I call you – can I call you, Steamy?
Briggon: Yeah, Steamy as well.
Lauren: Steamy.
Brandon: Good.
Briggon: I am big into fashion.
Eric: Okay.
Briggon: And I'm also an astronaut.
Amanda: Oh?
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: A non-practicing astronauts?
Lauren: You've been to space?
Briggon: Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
Brandon: I can’t tell a Steamy’s lying or a Briggon’s lying.
Amanda: Lauren, we’re in space right now.
Briggon: I'm the smooth one of the group. And, if Mothman wasn't taking up our living space, I'd be doing really cool space experiments.
Lauren: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Brandon: On Earth.
Lauren: Yeah, that sounds very real... Manny.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Cool.
Briggon: Because it is.
Brandon: Do you have, like, a centrifuge in your living room? Just—
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: The biggest telescope.
Briggon: I have toilet paper rolls and—
Eric: I would be in space right now but Mothman’s really fucking my shit up. What astronaut has roommates? I know – I know that’s not the thing to focus on, but shit. Oh, goddamnit. Okay.
Brandon: Do you have like a fashion spacesuit? It's like, spacesuit but fashion.
Briggon: Yeah, well, you add little elements of flair—
Brandon: Love it.
Briggon: – for your personality. But I usually wear like, something really ostentatious under the spacesuit as sort of like a surprise for later or something.
Eric: Aah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, that's your after-party look—
Brandon: Exactly.
Amanda: – after the award ceremony.
Briggon: Yeah.
Brandon: Zero gravity sequence. That’s pretty great.
Eric: I do like this. This is like Tan France was an astronaut.
Briggon: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: Someone’s like, Uh—
Briggon: You described my perfect man.
Brandon: Very cocky.
Eric: Tan France, but make it astronaut.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yup. Alright.
Amanda: Extremely good.
Eric: Amazing.
Amanda: And our next task is to describe the place that you are sharing. So, everyone is welcome to throw in ideas here. Like, do you own or rent it? Is it an apartment versus a house? Are you all roommates on an ongoing basis or are some of you like here visiting others that you might know beforehand? And then you can also each choose a useful feature that the house has. I’m also going to let us do it in your car. So, if either your house or your car has like an interesting feature. Some of the examples listed here are like a big wardrobe, a garage workshop, a home theater system, a tool shed, a wine cellar. I don’t why it's useful, but it’s cool. A cult junk in the attic, et cetera.
Briggon: Huh.
Amanda: Mothman may or may not be ruining this thing by the way. So, let me know if he hasn't discovered it yet. Or, if Mothman who is just like a – just like an ooze just taken over all your cool stuff that he isn't paying rent on has gotten to it yet.
Lauren: So, we're all – I mean we're adults. So, we presumably all have our own bedrooms in this house or apartment, right?
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Briggon: Yes.
Lauren: I think – I think Quincy definitely has like a weightlifting machine that also starts the train set. Like, kind of a Rube Goldberg situation.
Amanda: Incredible.
Lauren: So, yeah.
Amanda: Also, great accountability.
Lauren: Exactly.
Amanda: You can’t play with the train unless you work it out.
Lauren: Exactly. Yeah. I, I power my trains through my muscles. And I think I, I lock my door every time I leave my bedroom. I don't think that Mothman has found it yet.
Amanda: Great. Excellent.
Eric: I do think just we are all in this – in a house. I think that is the most—
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah, I think so true.
Brandon: This is fantasy, and I want to live in a nice house.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Lauren: Have to live.
Eric: Alright. So, imagine it's Columbus, Ohio.
Amanda: It’s the Midwest. Any of us might buy a house in our lifetimes. And—
Eric: Eric Schneider lives down the street. Anything can happen.
Briggon: And that was like weird influencer McMansions with like no art on the walls. And it’s just really just dark and kind of unsettling.
Lauren: It’s like the one leather couch and a huge pool.
Briggon: Yeah. Yeah. And we have huge followings.
Eric: All of us are all making Vines still.
Briggon: Yeah.
Eric: So, also, Vine still exists.
Lauren: This is the fantasy world. So, Vines is in this.
Amanda: Great. So, we're all in a house. We're all roommates. Each of you has your own room. And there's some common areas as well. Any other like cool stuff, either in the house or in your cars that you might want to throw in here?
Brandon: Yeah, I think Joel has like a full tool kit in his trunk. You know, like—
Amanda: Nice. Great.
Brandon: – it's like – it's like perfectly organized. We have 30 different screwdrivers of varying lengths in standard and metric. And it's every tool you could possibly think of.
Briggon: I think we have a fireplace.
Amanda: Excellent.
Briggon: And – but, up the chimney, I have stashed a secret space go-bag for if I have to leave in an emergency.
Eric: Space go-bag.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, tell me – tell me – tell me what kind of bits that’s in that?
Briggon: Oh, it’s like a – it has like freeze-dried food in it and space passports and just like things—
Eric: Space passport.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: Now, are those – is that a home invention? Or do you buy this from somebody on the internet?
Briggon: You buy it from somebody on the internet.
Brandon: Is a halo rocket in it too? Like—
Briggon: It – no, rocket fuel.
Brandon: Rocket fuel.
Briggon: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Lauren: Is it in like a Louis Vuitton bag or something like that?
Briggon: Yeah, Of course.
Lauren: Yeah.
Brandon: So, if we lit a fire—
Briggon: Like an orange. That’s really nice.
Lauren: Yeah. Yeah.
Briggon: Yeah.
Brandon: When we lit a fire in the fireplace and there's rocket fuel above it, we're all fine.
Briggon: Well, nobody lights fires there, because I—
Eric: Right.
Briggon: – say that I have, like, a breathing condition from the smoke.
Brandon: Yes. Yes.
Briggon: So, no one's supposed to use the fireplace.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: Good feature for an astronaut.
Briggon: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah, high stakes.
Briggon: Yeah.
Lauren: I like it.
Eric: I think I have a library. I think that that's the one thing I couldn't – that I could feasibly keep. I think it has just like – maybe I can roll for it, but just like lots and lots of shit. I think if that's like a – like an eclectic array of things anywhere from big – lots of Shakespeare to the occult and monster stuff.
Briggon: Is this, like, if you brought Belle into your room, she'd like, lose here shit?
Eric: Yeah.
Briggon: Sweet.
Eric: And then – and then the baker with his rolls, like, always come by. And I'm just like, “No, no, no.” Yes. So, I think that I have – and it can be – I can put it in the main area. I think everyone – I think that's enough, like, Everyman stuff. I'm just like, “Hey, howdy y'all. I have – I love books. Do you like books? Like, Christopher Jackson? You know that man? You – do you all like The Da Vinci Code? I have that. But, also, I just also have like magic books and like fucking – and all of Shakespeare I put up as well, but I only talk about like Percy Jackson and the, The Da Vinci Code.
Amanda: Does Drew have a cover story as his occupation?
Eric: Oh, shit. Yeah, he just works in sales.
Lauren: Yep.
Eric: Just sales.
Amanda: Great.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Joel looks at the Shakespeare on the shelf and looks back at Drew and looks back to the Shakespeare and looks back at Drew.
Eric (as Drew): What is it, Chum? Would you like to read Percy Jackson with me? Would you like to have a book club in our shared house?
Brandon: And then he picks up the Da Vinci Code and walks away for it.
Amanda: Very good.
Eric (as Drew): Ah, Dan Brown, my favorite. Aha!
Amanda (as Drew): You should start with Angels and Demons.
Eric (as Drew): The cipher is tricky, but you get it after a little while.
Amanda (as Drew): If that one's too hard, you can try Artemis Fowl!
Amanda: Amazing. And I think our last kind of scene-setting thing here is where is Mothman crashing? And then we can also decide, like, a persistent problem that you all are facing that Mothman did not cause. So, there are some examples that we can think out of the box. Like, a rival who's out to get you, an evil neighbor, an important work thing, which is very vague. It sounds very much like up Drew’s alley, someone's unemployed, a cryptid-hunting landlord, et cetera.
Lauren: Is this a shared problem?
Amanda: Shared, shared problem for the house.
Lauren: Sort of the, the idea of like a rival neighbor is, is fun.
Amanda: I was thinking about like somebody who really enforces the HOA.
Lauren: Right.
Brandon: That’s it.
Amanda: Like, a neighbor who is like, “You have weed juice in your driveway.”
Lauren: Yeah, like your grasses are too high.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah, I like that a lot.
Eric: That's good.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Like, the fence – like, there's some fence dispute.
Eric: Yeah, I like that.
Brandon: Like, he parked on the street inside of your driveway one night.
Amanda: Excellent.
Brandon: And they give you a ticket immediately.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: It's like a fake ticket. Like, they printed off themselves.
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: They're like, “From the neighborhood watch.
Lauren: Because the HOA can give tickets.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Like, from the Grassy Hole Neighborhood Watch.
Lauren: Grassy Hole.
Eric: That’s the – that’s the name—
Brandon: The name of our neighborhood’s Grassy Hole?
Eric: Yeah, it’s bad.
Amanda: Oh, no.
Brandon: Oh, no.
Amanda: Oh, geez.
Brandon: Oh, geez.
Amanda: Oh, boy. Oh, okay.
Brandon: Oh, no.
Amanda: Well, that wraps up Mothman Party.
Lauren: Fun party.
Eric: Listen, at least two of you, should be listening to my DMing. So, I don't know why you’re surprised. I'm not gonna say who.
[collective laughter]
Amanda: Great. So, we're gonna open here in the evening after work. It is a Tuesday evening. Everybody is home, and you are just trying to do your normal evening activities. So, what do you guys do like on, on a work night before you go to bed?
Eric (as Drew): I think I make a big scene of doing regular man things. So, I walk and I'm like, “Oh, what a good day after work at sales!” And I go over to the fridge, and I pull out like a can of beer. And I'm like, “Ah, refreshing brewski for me to enjoy, to relax after sales.” And I crack – crack it open and go, “Pfft! Ah!!”. And I sit down on the couch, and I'm like, “Time for me to watch football,” but Mothman is sitting – is laying on the couch. So, I can't dramatically like go, “Aah!” like I usually do.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric (as Drew): And I will say, “Uh, hello, Mothman. I need to do my relaxing times to chill out after the band kept me down.”
Amanda (as Mothman): I wish I could relax.
Eric (as Drew): It seems like you are on our couch.
Amanda (as Mothman): I just – I really just want my van back, you know? Like I, I just – it went missing. And then I couldn't find it. And then – and then, today, someone said on the internet that they saw my van at the Cryptid Museum. So, I just think that's really unfair. Like, if they asked me – they asked me for some of my like relics or my old clothes or, or, like – I don't know – a coffee cup that I used once, I would just give it to them, but they took my van, man.
Brandon (as Joel): They stole your van, and then put it in a museum for others to look at?
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah, man!
Eric (as Drew): Oh, Joel, you're also home from job!
Amanda: Eric, can you go ahead and roll the dice for me, please.
Eric: Roll just for what?
Amanda: Just roll.
Eric: Okay.
[Dice Rolls]
Amanda: Don't worry about it.
Eric: Oh, three.
Amanda: Okay. So, the other roommates are mildly suspicious of you at this time.
Eric: Oh, no!
Briggon: Yeah.
Eric: I normally does such a good job of obscuring it.
Brandon: Joel has been in the recliner in the living area this entire time.
Amanda: Yeah.
Briggon: And he's just looking at Drew side-eyed. Like, what are you doing? Who are you?
Lauren: Yeah. Quincy has been behind the couch—
Amanda: Oh?
Lauren: – all of my – he’s like sitting on the floor. All of my, my paints are like spread out in space or like behind the couch play in between like the couch in the window out to outside.
Amanda: Yes.
Lauren (as Quincy): And I'm trying to – I'm trying to paint a little house and spend all my paints, but it keeps breaking my paint—
Brandon (as Joel): Quincy!
Lauren (as Quincy): What?
Brandon (as Joel): You’ve been there the whole time?
Eric (as Drew): Oh, Quincy, you're also home from job.
Lauren (as Quincy): Yes. Yes, I am – I am home from my job.
Amanda (as Mothman): You guys come home from your jobs like five out of every seven days. I know why this is so incredible to remark on. I just – I’m – I don’t know what the problem here. Also, your neighbor stopped by, and he said something about the grass. I didn't land to the door, because I'm, I'm a Mothman, buddy. He’s yelling at the door.
Brandon (as Joel): Please, please, don’t answer the door. Please, never answer the door.
Amanda (as Mothman): No, no, I won't. I won’t
Brandon (as Joel): Okay.
Amanda (as Mothman): There’s someone out to get me. You know, it's just kind of depressing. So—
Lauren (as Quincy): Did they – what did they – what did they say about the grass?
Amanda (as Mothman): That it was too high or low. I forgot.
Lauren (as Quincy): Grrrr.
Eric (as Drew): Oh, I think that we need to do what we would all call a roommates meeting. Where his good friend, Mannheim, from Space Job?
Briggon (as Mannheim): I- I walk in from my room going to the kitchen. I'm wearing a – an astronaut helmet.
Lauren: Oh.
Briggon (as Mannheim): I reach in --
Amanda: Open, open, or close, bud?
Briggon (as Mannheim): Closed.
Amanda: Okay. Good.
Briggon (as Mannheim): And I grab a Tang out of the fridge.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric (as Drew): I will say – and I’ve – and I’ve been wanting to say this the entire time. Manheim might as well be a Drag Queen. He fucking is.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Amanda (as Mothman): I mean we don't know that you’re not.
Lauren (as Quincy): We don’t know that that’s not the case.
Eric (as Drew): Like, we don’t know that you’re not.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Eric: But I'm just like, “You’re just describing things.” And I’d be like, “I would go see the show.”
Lauren: That would be a good background.
Eric: They would – he just need to go and sing Rocket Man with this on, lip-synching, and do a death drop, and I'd be like, “Fuck, yeah. Yes, queen!” This is – this is Eric talking.
Briggon: I, I grabbed the, the Tang. And I put it underneath the helmet. I don't open up the, the shield. I just have a sip of that.
Lauren: Does it have a straw?
Briggon: No.
Lauren: That's very awkward.
Briggon: There’s like a wholesome sort of like pleasing – you know, when you're trying—
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah, I do. Maybe it's a 20-ounce plastic bottle.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: Because you don't care about the environment.
Briggon: Yeah, Joel’s is—
Amanda: Maybe you’re just about space.
Brandon: We can just go to space. It’s fine
Eric: Hey.
Briggon: Let's leave.
Eric: If that’s the policy, throw your shit wherever you want.
Brandon: Yeah. Joel is reconsidering all of his life choices with everyone around him.
Amanda: So, again, it is your mandate here to try to help Mothman fix his problems in order to get the hell out of your house.
Brandon (as Joel): Mr. Man. What did your van look like? How do you know --
Lauren: Who’s that?
Amanda: Mr. Man! [laughs]
Brandon (as Joel): That's not your last name?
Eric (as Drew): Mr. Man is right there. That is our good roommate, Mannheim.
Brandon (as Joel): I thought your name was Moth Man.
Eric (as Drew): I think – hold on. I want to do this iambic pentameter. I think that our good friend, Manheim, is right. Let's all go drink some Tang together to, to, together – together is like apostrophized – to’nights.
Brandon: Wait. Hang on. No.
Eric (as Drew): Yes.
Amanda (as Mothman): I mean, normally, when I fill up government forms. I put The as my first name, and then Mothman is my last name. So, I get some, some like direct mail and stuff that is like, “Mothman, The.” And I'm like, “That's not who I am.”
Brandon (as Joel): Gotcha. Okay.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Hmm.
Brandon (as Joel): Uhh.
Lauren (as Quincy): So, we got you, Mr. Mothman.
Amanda (as Mothman): Just, just Mothman is fine...
Lauren (as Quincy): Just Mothman.
Brandon (as Joel): Mothman.
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah. You guys have been great. Listen, I, I just – I don't know. I, I didn't want to mention this, but we're almost out of Tang. And I find that beverage really pleasing. So, I don't know if someone could like, pick it up in the outside world. Like, I can't because I'm a Mothman.
Brandon (as Joel): We're almost out of Tang.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): You don't live here.
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah, us in our – in our household. Yeah.
Brandon (as Joel): Okay.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): Are you gonna pay rent?
Amanda (as Mothman): Uh, that's really rude to ask a depressed cryptid like me, but—
Briggon (as Mannheim): How do you know is your van?
Amanda (as Mothman): It's my van. I have stickers all over it. You know that—
Brandon (as Joel): What, what’s in the side of the van?
Amanda (as Mothman): – Coexist sticker? I invented that. The first one is on my bumper, man!
Brandon (as Joel): Is there other cryptids?
Eric (as Drew): Oh, I recognize the – I recognize that one. That is the sticker that says, “Honk if you can see the future.”
Amanda (as Mothman): I always thought that those Grateful Dead Bears look a lot like my friend, Sasquatch. So, I just kind of have a bunch of those all over.
Brandon (as Joel): Okay.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Oh, that's nice.
Lauren (as Quincy): What is your license plate?
Amanda (as Mothman): I don't have one. I think that was the problem.
Lauren (as Quincy): Do you live in your van?
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah, man. It's just – it's a sleeper. It's a camper. It goes wherever I need to go.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Where's the last place that you, you saw your van?
Amanda (as Mothman): Out by the camping grounds.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Oh.
Amanda (as Mothman): I parked in there. It's long term parking. And then, one day, I went out and I came back, and someone had taken it.
Lauren (as Quincy): And it's now in a museum?
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah, someone brought it to the museum. And the worst part is it says, “Alleged Mothman Van.” It's THE Mothman van. It’s my van!
Briggon (as Mannheim): Have you called the museum?
Amanda (as Mothman): No, I think that would make bigger problems for me if they knew that I was real
Briggon (as Mannheim): Huh.
Lauren (as Quincy): Mhmm.
Amanda (as Mothman): They think it. They don't know it. But I just – I don't know what to do. I can't leave the house. I don't have a car anymore. I just – I miss my van, man.
Brandon (as Joel): I have an idea. I am the dad of this group. I'm gonna call them and ask for a manager.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Joel, such – I love that.
Lauren (as Quincy): Yeah. Yeah, amazing.
Briggon (as Mannheim): That’s amazing.
Amanda (as Mothman): That's a – that’s a really proven tactic.
Brandon (as Joel): Alright. So, I'm going to call up the Cryptid Museum; 1-800-CRYPTIDS. And—
Eric: Everyone listening, call that number right now.
Amanda: So, here's how we're going to do this. You are going to roll two D6. It’s a little bit different from how the RPG suggests, but, for the narrative, that’s what we're gonna do on the show. Roll two D6. I'm going to give you another D6 that you can roll because you are proficient at being a dad and, and doing this here. And then, on a higher end of the spectrum, the good thing you want to happen happens. There's no consequences. On the lower end of the spectrum, the bad thing happens. The good things never gonna happen again. And we will deal with the fallout then.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Ah, my life.
Eric (as Drew): Cool.
Brandon: So, the – like, extra – extra dice is almost like an advantage reroll type situation.
Amanda: Yeah. So, why don't we roll three dice? And then you can eliminate the lowest one.
Brandon: Cool. We can use the same numbers, but—
(Dice rolls)
Brandon: 2, 4, and 1
Amanda: Okay. So, we'll eliminate the lowest one. 2 + 4 is a 6. So, it's a pretty mixed result. So, why don't you initiate the call to the museum?
Brandon (as Joel): Okay. Ring. Ring. Ring. Ring.
Eric: This is great.
Brandon (as Joel): Ring. Ring.
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Hello.
Brandon (as Joel): Hello. This is Mr. Stevens.
Amanda (as Museum personnel): How'd you get this phone number?
Brandon (as Joel): I found it in the phone book.
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Okay. No, I’m just joshing you. Welcome to the Museum. It’s just a little thing I do at work. So—
Brandon (as Joel): Sir, I don't appreciate your tone. Can I talk to your manager, please?
Amanda (as Museum personnel): I mean he's out hunting something. He wouldn't tell me exactly what. So, it’s either—
Brandon (as Joel): Can you route the phone call, please?
Amanda (as Museum personnel): It’s me or the intern. No, he does not bring a cellphone with him anywhere.
Brandon (as Joel): That's very odd. Do you have another person above—
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Government tracking, man. Government tracking.
Brandon (as Joel): Is the intern above you?
Amanda (as Museum personnel): No, why are you asking so many questions?
Brandon (as Joel): Mhmm. You have my child's van.
Amanda (as Museum personnel): I'm sorry. Like, it was left in the parking lot.
Brandon (as Joel): You illegally towed my teenage son’s van!
[collective laughter]
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Oh, are you talking about that camper with no license plates?
Brandon (as Joel): Yes, that is the camper I am referring to. It's my teenage son's van!
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Well, I mean, if he was driving it around and there's no license plates, then, listen, someone’s going to tow it.
Brandon (as Joel): (yelling) Are you the cops?
Eric: Yeah. You know how – you know what dads say? “Are you the cops?”
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Can't, can’t trust the cops, man. Can't trust the cops.
Brandon (as Joel): So, you do thievery as opposed to calling the cops?
Amanda (as Museum personnel): Listen, we operate in the gray man. It's that stuff that you think exists, but no one knows.
Eric: I love.
Briggon (as Mannheim): In a gray, man.
Brandon (as Joel): Well, here – here, let me tell you, son. Here's what I'm going to do. I am going to call the cops on you! If you do not let me get my son's van back.
Amanda (as Museum personnel): If you can show up and prove, proof of ownership, then we have to give you back your property because people own things.
Brandon (as Joel): Are you one of those socialists, sir?
Amanda (as Museum personnel): I'm outside the political spectrum, man. You don't even know how I – how I do.
Brandon (as Joel): You're an anarchist!
Brandon: And I hang up the phone.
Eric (as Drew): So, how did it go?
Brandon (as Joel): It went really well y'all. We can go to the Cryptid Museum and show proof of ownership, which I assume you have, Mothman. And we'll just get it back.
Amanda (as Mothman): Uh, no. Someone gave me the, the camper when I helped them avoid a house fire. And I've just been driving it ever since, you know?
Brandon (as Joel): Well, I give up!
Lauren (as Quincy): Is there, like, anything in the glove box? Like, registration, insurance?
Amanda (as Mothman): No, I don't do those things. But there's like pictures of, of me. There's like stuff. There's journals and—
Lauren (as Quincy): Do you show up on photographs?
Amanda (as Mothman): That's a very weird question to ask. Yeah, I do.
Eric (as Drew): He's a large Mothman.
Lauren (as Quincy): Hmm-hmmm.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Well, wait, they would want Mothman over a van, right? This is a Cryptid Museum.
Brandon (as Joel): We can just trade Mothman in—
Amanda (as Mothman): Oh, no!
Eric (as Drew): Well, it could be a trap.
Brandon (as Joel): – for a van.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Oh, yo! We – our problem’s solve. We just give Mothman over to the Cryptid Museum.
Amanda (as Mothman): That’s not a – that's – that’s not – that’s not what I want to happen.
Brandon (as Joel): Why not?
Eric (as Drew): Oh, that’s what my friends at work call a dick move. That's what I have heard them call it.
Brandon (as Joel): Okay. Okay. You’re right. You’re right. You’re right.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah. No, but we use it as—
Lauren (as Quincy): As, as bait.
Briggon (as Mannheim): – as bait. We say we've got Mothman. We just want the van back. And then we double-cross the, the Cryptid Museum patriarchy for the, the van.
Lauren (as Quincy): It’s very smooth.
Briggon (as Mannheim): The anarchist.
Eric (as Drew): I like that.
Amanda: Mothman jumps up onto his feet and stares at the ceiling. And his eyes kind of go blank. I'm describing by the way. He's extremely ripped! [laughter] and has very wide wings that look like a moth but can fold up kind of like a – like an angel or into chicken wing or something like that.
Lauren: Quincy is very intimidated by this. He doesn't like that there's someone more ripped in the house than he is.
Amanda: Yeah. Well, I can see why you're being so—
Lauren: Yeah.
Amanda: – aggressive toward Mothman.
Briggon : Mannheim lifts up his biceps.
Lauren (as Quincy): He’s biceps.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Just look—
Brandon (as Joel): To get a better look?
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Amanda: So—
Briggon (as Mannheim): Tska-tsh-tsh-tska!
Amanda: Mothman stands up, his wings extend completely outward. He's like a 12-foot wingspan guys. They like, brush the books on both sides of the room. And then out a sort of like very—
Briggon (as Mannheim): You know, what they say about the wingspan.
Brandon (as Joel): It’s better to fly with.
Lauren (as Quincy): Yeah.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Eric (as Drew): Big penis!
Amanda: Mothman doesn't hear any of you, because he is deep in the trance.
Lauren (as Quincy): For the best.
Eric (as Drew): Well, that was Eric. Eric ripped a hole just like I said it...
Amanda: And Mothman, in a – in a voice that sounds like it's coming from faraway says, Amanda (as Mothman): “They're, they’re coming from the sky with their lights to take and take tonight.” And then he, like, collapsed back down the couch. Like, “Oh, oh, what did I say? Oh, I'm so sorry. It's so embarrassing. It's like, when you twitches, you fall asleep. And then someone who's there knows that – I'm sorry. What did I say?”
Brandon (as Joel): Aaaaah.
Eric (as Drew): So, who wants to get tacos tonight?
Briggon (as Mannheim): Wait. You said people are coming from the sky.
Lauren (as Quincy): With lights?
Briggon (as Mannheim): Aliens?
Amanda (as Mothman): Did I?
(Players yells affirmatively)
Lauren (as Quincy): Yes.
Eric (as Drew): Yes.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yes.
Brandon (as Joel): Yes, you did.
Amanda (as Mothman): Aaah. Well, that's not good. I – listen, you guys have been really nice. And I don't want to like bring alien visitations down upon your household. So, can we like – I don't know – figure out this van thing soon? Like, right now.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Wait. You know aliens?
Amanda (as Mothman): I mean I, I don't not know about them. [snickers] But I – it’s a little bit like – it's kind of like a cryptid pact. Like, you don't want to say that someone else exists. They're not gonna say that you exist and, like, out each other to the broader human society.
Eric (as Drew): Alright. I get that.
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah.
Briggon (as Mannheim): I totally have experience with, with aliens. And they're very – yeah, I'm, I’m – like, yeah, I understand. Totally.
Lauren (as Quincy): Oh, so, it’s not going to be a problem then if they come down, because you can just talk to them?
Brandon (as Joel): What is happening?
Eric: Oh, can I – can I look at something in a – in the books about this? Like some—
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: – anything that's like monster, about aliens, or—
Briggon: Da Vinci Code.
Eric: Yeah, I can look in Da Vinci Code, actually. So, I would like to roll – am I prepared because I have books?
Amanda: Yeah, let’s do it.
Eric: I have a book on this. Alright.
Amanda: Throw three D6.
Eric: Okay. Oh, no, Brandon touched this. This is gonna be a bad roll.
[Dice rolls]
Eric: Alright. So, I got a 5, and a 6, and a 1. So, I'm going to drop the 1. So, I get an 11.
Amanda: Great. So, what do you want to learn from these books?
Eric: I think I want to know – I, I have two questions to, to my fellow players. I either want to know about aliens, because I think that we know it's aliens or about, like, how good Mothman prophecies are. Like, do I want to know about prophecies or do I want to – we – are we making the leap that it is aliens if I'm gonna look up shit about aliens.
Lauren: Huh.
Amanda: I think it's a good time for a Mothman surprise.
Brandon: We should build something.
Eric: Oh. So, hold on. Do we have a stinger for that?
Amanda: Chica! chica!
Eric; Mothman surprise!
Amanda: So, basically, here, you, you can roll to see if you can get a special insight or message from Mothman. I mean you can ask me one of these questions, and I can just tell you straight up what the answer is.
Brandon: Oh, okay.
Lauren: Oh, awesome!
Eric: So, do I have to use my roll? I can just ask you?
Amanda: You're gonna roll again. So, you can roll two D6.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: Mothman surprises sounds like we bake into some kind of password.
[Dice rolls]
Lauren: It really does.
Eric: Oh, I only got a 5.
Amanda: Okay. So, we didn't get the Mothman surprise this time. But you can – why don’t you choose one question to ask your books, and I will – I will tell you the answer.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: You do get the sense that Mothman's not putting on any kind of artifice with the vision. Like, this is something that overcomes him. He says it. And, knowing Mothman from lore, he's known for predicting true things and helping people to avert disaster. So, I’m happy having that as like a baseline level of recognition—
Lauren: Okay. So, we do know that.
Amanda: – with Mothman.
Lauren: Okay.
Eric: Yeah. I think it's like, “Does Mothman have an association with other cryptids?” I think because you said that you're friends with Bigfoot, and they're also aliens. So, like, is there, like, a cryptid MCU I think is—
Lauren: Well – and, like, this Mothman have – have—
Brandon: A CCU?
Eric: Yeah, a CCU. Yeah.
Lauren: – enemies. Like, are the aliens friends or foe?
Eric: Yes, definitely. Like, what is Mothman’s association with other Cryptids specifically about aliens in this relationship?
Amanda: Gotcha. So, I will tell you with an 11.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: I'll tell you with an 11 that Mothman hasn't met any aliens before, but he has heard tell that they are legit. And everybody is kind of waiting for them to come. So, that is not like the kind of whole, you know, alien watch like UFOlogy situation. They're not completely wrong. And he has not met any of them before. But him and Sasquatch and some of the other cryptids that are in North America do know each other. They have cell phones. They text. They have a Snapchat chain going. And they can communicate with each other. Mothman's cell phone however was in his van.
Eric (as Drew): Oh, no.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Aaah.
Eric (as Drew): Ah. So, I learned from my cool regular books. That, that Mothman has many friends on monstrous occasions. And we could figure out how they all hang out. But it seems like they don't have a – Mothman doesn't have a communication device. Like, we all have, when we all text in our roommate group text. Mothman has that with other monsters.
Brandon (as Joel): No. Are we sure that he's not the alien?
Lauren (as Quincy): I’m – I’m—
Briggon (as Mannheim): Wait. You guys are in a group text?
Amanda (as Mothman): Okay. You might want to look out the front window.
Eric (as Drew): What?

And our thanks to Twenty Sided Store in Brooklyn, New York for supporting this and every episode. Their co-owner, Lauren Bilanko, is our resident master Dungeon Master. We bring her your D&D questions just like this one. How do you handle players who like to make multiple skill checks in a row after they fail the first one? Master Dungeon Master says, “Get in the habit of always asking your players to first describe what they're doing and how they plan to do it. Then you can choose the appropriate skill for them to roll to accomplish the task and to role-play the outcome. So, if a bard for example is trying to persuade the guard and that didn't work, the difficulty class would definitely go up if the bard immediately then try to intimidate the guard. You can also let your player know how difficult the role is going to be and describe the possible outcomes of both a success and a fail. So, when the bard rolls low, they have to role-play what happens next. Whether you're a DM or a player, you'll find what you need at Twenty Sided Store. Get 20 percent off using the discount code, Join the Party in their Williamsburg Brooklyn store, or online.
And, now, let's get back to the show.
Theme Music
Amanda: Mothman sort of like peels open the blinds in the front of the living room. Like, behind the couch where – where the Quincy and painting was happening. And you see outside that there are about 25 people with signs looking up at the sky saying things like, “Welcome.”
Eric: Ha!
Brandon: Ooh.
Amanda: And we can't wait.
Lauren: Mhmm.
Eric (as Drew): I remember doing this with my good friend, Nicolas Cage. I mean, Nicolas Cages, a man at my job, looking at aliens. What?
Amanda: Mothman lays a hand on your shoulder and whispers,-
Amanda (as Mothman): “Nick’s a friend of mine, too.”
Eric (as Drew): Oh, you know, Nicolas Cages from the job?
Amanda: Mothman winks at you.
Lauren (as Quincy): I feel like, with all this new information that, yeah—
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): – it does seem like our roommate is an alien.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Eric (as Drew): No, just a regular guy. Mountain Drew alien. Mountain Drew Everyman, that's me. I think we should go get Mothman's phone back. Let's all go in Joel's car.
Brandon (as Joel): Alright. But you're sitting in the back seat, and I'm putting the blanket down.
Eric (as Drew): That's fine. Wherever you want. Jesus fucking Christ. So, do you think Drew is not a person?
Brandon (as Joel): I'm not convinced you're some goofy alien.
Eric (as Drew): Yeah, because I pooped myself when I go in the car.
Amanda (as Mothman): Guys. Hey, Drew – Drew is not an alien, man. Have you never seen an alien before, god!
Lauren (as Quincy): Have you?
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah.
Brandon (as Joel): Where?
Amanda (as Mothman): I mean I’ve – I've like – they Snap me sometimes whenever they're in in range. The, the Cryptid Group Chat I told you about before. Yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): Alright.
Eric (as Drew): On the group chat!
Lauren (as Quincy): Are they nice?
Amanda (as Mothman): No one's really sure, and we're all too afraid to ask.
Lauren (as Quincy): Okay.
Amanda (as Mothman): So, listen, again, you've been – you’re very hospitable. I don't mean to make you commit a crime, but I want not to bring aliens down upon your household, because, now that these guys are here – and gestures out the window toward all the picketers – they are gonna think that this is like an important and holy site for the rest of time if aliens end up coming here. So, maybe we should try to – try to get that done.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Everyone in Joel's car.
Eric (as Drew): Shotgun!
Lauren (as Quincy): No, you're sitting in the trunk.
Eric (as Drew): Ha, ha. Trunk best spots.
Briggon (as Mannheim): I grab the go-bag from the—
Eric (as Drew): Smart.
Briggon (as Mannheim): – fireplace. And I run into my room and just grab like a nice boa just for flare just in case.
Amanda: Nice.
Lauren (as Quincy): I effortlessly move the huge toolbox in his trunk to, to make room for, for Drew in the back.
Eric (as Drew): Excelsior!
Briggon (as Mannheim): Be careful of that.
Lauren (as Quincy): I got it. I got it. I got it.
Amanda: Now, no one has mentioned an attached garage. So, I'm thinking of the cars are parked outside. How are we going to get Mothman into the car?
Brandon (as Joel): Well, they—
Briggon (as Mannheim): Oh, I put my astronaut helmet on him and put the boa around his—
Amanda: Oh, incredible.
Eric (as Drew): Yeah. Hell yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): Color effect. Yeah.
Amanda: Incredible.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Amanda: Roll for it, and let's see how that goes.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Okay.
Lauren (as Quincy): Would he fit in the car?
Amanda: So, three D6 here because you are proficient in fashion.
Eric (as Drew): I think – I think Manheim is also prepared.
[Dice rolls]
Briggon: Mhmm.
Lauren: Oh.
Brandon: Oh, no.
Eric: Oh, shit!
Amanda: Oh. That's a triple crit.
Briggon (as Mannheim): It’s Earth;s gravity.
Brandon: Yeah. Right.
Briggon (as Mannheim): It’s my fashion.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric (as Drew): Because Mannheim is good at fashion, can I roll another D6?
Amanda: We already did are good at fashion D6. What is your argument that you prepared for this? Is that you've been waiting for this, this scenario?
Lauren: You mean to makeover?
Briggon: My entire life. Yeah.
Amanda: Okay. Alright. You can have one more D6 after that.
Briggon: Oh, yay.
(Dice rolls)
Amanda: Oh, It’s a – it’s a fourth one.
Eric: Oh, my god.
Brandon: Another one.
Lauren: Amazing!
Eric: Yep.
Amanda: Alright. So—
Brandon: Did you – did you load these dice the wrong way?
Eric: I don't know Brandon did touch them first. So—
Lauren: Wow.
Brandon: So—
Amanda: So, here's how this goes down.
Briggon: Oh, no.
Amanda: So, everybody is waiting in the car except for Mannheim and Mothman.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: You have Mothman with the helmet with the boa, but nothing else that you mentioned. So, just, just his ripped bod and wings.
Briggon: Yeah. Yeah.
Amanda: And, as you try to kind of sneak out like the kitchen door like the side door of the house around the driveway, the picketers spot you immediately and start taking photos.
Briggon: Great.
Amanda: So, I will say that you're able to pull away, but there are definitely photos of you and Mothman. Definitely photos of what seems to be Mothman wearing an alien helmet—
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: – which does not help with the whole alien situation.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: And a couple of them jumped in their cars to start following you.
Briggon: But I looked fantastic in the photos though, right?
Amanda: You looked outstanding.
Briggon: Great. Awesome.
Eric: National – National Inquirer, “Mothman and Boyfriend?”
Amanda: Yes.
Briggon: We’re – we’re in the Bigfoot stride.
Amanda: Someone photoshopped you into Abbey Road.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: It’s a whole thing. It’s a whole thing.
Lauren: It’s a meme already by the time we get into the car.
Amanda: Incredible.
Brandon (as Joel): I want to really safely jump the curve to pick them up and drive away.
Amanda: You're an extremely safe driver. So, give me three D6, please.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: A 6 and a 4. So, 10.
Amanda: Excellent. So, you do. You definitely leave some tire tracks that help give a, a kind of direction of where you were headed, but you're able to pick them up. And you are swiftly making your way toward the Cryptid Museum.
Brandon (as Joel): How do you like our grass now?
Eric: Eric Schneider.
Brandon (as Joel): I keep--
Eric: It’s Eric Schneider.
Amanda: Oh, it’s a pretty sick burn on your neighbor. You seem like a jerk. Speaking of which though—
Eric: Do you – do you bite your thumb at me, sir?
Amanda: Eric, please roll a D6.
Eric: Just one?
Amanda: Just the one.
Eric: Oh, okay.
Amanda: This is a suspension dice.
Eric: Three again.
Amanda: Okay. So, it definitely tickles the back of Joel's mind that you have heard someone with almost the same voice to say almost the same thing before.
Brandon (as Joel): Yeah, I give – I give Drew another look.
Eric: In my head, I was definitely in Romeo plus Juliet. Definitely. Definitely.
Briggon: You know what are their names?
Eric: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Definitely. When I was a younger man, I was definitely the – one of the guys in the beginning of – in Act 1 Scene 1 of Romeo and Juliet. And I—
Lauren: At the gas station?
Briggon: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: Yeah. Yeah, 100 percent. I was definitely one of those guys.
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: We should just watch that. Can we stop?
Amanda: I know. I know.
Briggon: Truly.
Amanda: Be extremely persuasive. Great. So, on our way to the Cryptid Museum, are there any like tips, tricks, back roads? Are we just heading straight there? Are we gonna call again? What are your thoughts?
Eric: So, Joel's driving.
Brandon (as Joel): Is there an HOV light?
Amanda: These are all surface streets because you don't live too far from the museum.
Brandon (as Joel): Yeah.
Amanda: And I will say that it's about 8:00 o'clock and the museum closes at 9:00.
Lauren: Okay.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: How long does it take to get that do you think? Just normally.
Amanda: About 15 minutes.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Remember, we live in Columbus, Ohio.
Brandon: Right.
Amanda: Everything is 15 minutes away.
Lauren: And there was no traffic ever.
Amanda: No.
Eric: Let's see.
Amanda: They – you say the word traffic. And they’re like, “A big shot from a city, are ya?”
Briggon: That's a good question.
Eric: I'm gonna try to call this time.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric (as Drew): Because I'm gonna be like, “Joel, give me your phone. I am good at impressions.”
Brandon: Okay.
Eric (as Drew): I can do Ted from the movie, Ted.
Brandon (as Joel): Can I hear it?
Eric (as Drew as Ted): Hey, look at me. I'm fucking Ted. I'm a fucking teddy bear. Blah!
Brandon: Oh, my god that was spot on, bro.
Amanda: That’s really impressive, man.
Lauren: Really. Yeah.
Amanda: That’s really impressive.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: You should really – you should really lean into that.
Eric (as Ted): Oh, Seth – Seth MacFarlane – Seth MacFarlane, he's a really funny guy. He's good at writing and also acting and singing.
Brandon: Well, that doesn’t sound right.
Eric (as Drew): It’s from the movie, “Ted.” That was a quote.
Amanda (as Mothman): You can lean it to that, man. That's pretty good.
Eric (as Drew): Aah, they've told me I could do acting. Huh!
Brandon: What?
Eric: I shouldn't have said that. I mean community theater, but I did it at home.
Amanda: Let’s go. One – one more roll.
Eric: Oh, fuck, I guess I forgot.
Briggon: Mannheim loves watching Orville. So—
[Dice rolls]
Eric: Oh, shit. It’s five.
Amanda: Something has unlocked in Joel's brain. And there's a ticking time bomb of when he is going to identify you.
Briggon: His eyes go super wide.
Amanda: I think, if you weren't driving, you would say something.
Brandon: Absolutely.
Amanda: You are driving right now.
Brandon: Yeah, that's true.
Eric: But I need to keep my hands at 10 and 2.
Brandon: Yeah, my eyes – my eyes don't stray from forward.
Eric: Alright. So, I want to – I'm also gonna call it the Cryptid Museum.
Amanda: Yes, and what is your tactic here?
Eric: I think I'm gonna lie and say that you've been talking enough. And I think that I have gotten your voice, Mothman’s voice enough that I'm gonna try to be Mothman.
Lauren: Hmm.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): And be like, “Hey, so, so, it's my car. So, if you could just lead me there.”
Brandon: Why would that be helpful? You'd be confirming that Mothman—
Amanda: When I go into Mothman—
Eric: What I'm going to do, I'm gonna get them to go away. I'm gonna say – I'm gonna—
Brandon: Oh, okay.
Eric: I mean, doing a passion of Mothman—
Lauren: Got you.
Eric: – and say that like the direct – because I heard you were – that was on speaker, right?
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: Okay. So, I'm gonna say that, that what’s his – the manager is hunting Mothman. And they're hanging out. And they need everybody to go from the Cryptinomica to, to leave.
Lauren: To, like, the hunting place.
Eric: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric: Like, they need to go out into the Ohio woods and just like, get fucked.
Brandon: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Okay. Great. And are there any Netflix films that you are drawing inspiration from that can help you out here?
Eric: Yeah. I think there's, like – in preparation, there's a Seth MacFarlane cryptid movie called Mothman and Friends, and then I watched that. I watched all of Seth MacFarlane’s oeuvre to keep me prepared to be an Everyman.
Brandon: What's the Rotten Tomato score on that one?
Eric: Oh, it's like 23. Inexplicably, Charlize Theron is in it too.
Amanda: Alright. So, let's, let's get a roll with three D6 to see how this call turns out with the Museum.
Eric: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Eric: Okay. I, I rolled a 5 and a 3 and dropping low. So, that's an 8 and then a 12.
Amanda: Great. Okay. So, you get the same person, who's-- hackles are already raised and a little bit suspicious.
Eric: Right.
Amanda: So, you call the museum. And they say again, “Hello?”
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Hey, hey, everyone. It's, it’s your good friend, Mothman. You know, everyone knows that's the voice I use. Uh, it’s me.
Amanda: In the background, Mothman goes, “That's not how I sound like.”
Eric: It sounds like—
Amanda: And it’s definitely on the ball.
Briggon: Kermit doing an impression of Mothman.
Brandon (as Joel): Mothman do you have a brother?
Briggon (as Mothman): Mothman, the moth here.
Amanda: What you don’t know Briggon is that my voice is an impression of Eric doing an impression of Kermit. So, you are – you are on point.
Lauren: Oh, my god. Spot on.
Amanda: You’re on point.
Eric (as Kermit): So, why are there so many songs about Mothman. Mothman have nothing to hide.
Amanda (in a Kermit voice): So Mothman, the aliens, and meeeee.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Hey, so, my friends, the aliens, they're coming down. So, I think you should go hang out with them. We're gonna go hang out in the woods. And your manager is also here. He's just coming to hang out. Yay! They're also coming to hang out. And we should all just go hang out in the woods and look at aliens. It's part of – you’ll get a bonus if you find the aliens. Yay! Come on out.
Lauren (as Manager): Yeah, it's super fun. Mothman is really cool. I’m your manager.
Eric (as Mothman): Thanks, manager. Let’s all hang out.
Brandon (as Joel): Where did you get this cool Kool-Aid full of cool alcohol and party and confetti stuff?
Eric (as Mothman): That was one of the aliens. He has cool shit.
Amanda (as Museum person): Who's at this party?
Eric (as Kermit): Oh, you know, it’s—
Eric: Now, I'm actually doing Kermit.
Eric (as Mothman): Oh. Hey, it’s, it's me, and your manager, and the aliens, and were all – and also Bigfoot is here. Whoa! He brought Natty Light. Wow!
Amanda (as Museum person): I am so torn between thinking this is a normal prank call and then the presence of Natty Light, which I don't think any Cryptid would choose or any person would make up.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Oh, it obviously – you obviously don't know much about Bigfoot. He loves Slim and Natty’s.
Briggon (as Manheim): Oh, my god Bigfoot. What a cool backflip you just did?
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Oh, I just did a sick backflip. You guys are missing it
Amanda: Is someone funneling? I'm a funnel master.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Go. Oh, yeah. They're fun – they funnel. Is it-
Lauren (as Quincy): Yeah, I got the funnel beer.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Yeah. They're funneling a bunch over there on the tree stump, because we're in the woods.
Brandon (as Joel): Joel said, “What's a funnel?”
Eric: It’s exact—
Briggon: Manny puts on Space Odyssey on Spotify in the background.
Amanda: So good.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): We’re all doing power hours. Come on out.
Amanda (as Museum person): So, the employee – you hear them go, “Fuck, Janel, can you close for me? Just, just like – just close the door. You don't have to lock it. It's fine. Fine.” Okay. I'll be right there. Thanks for the heads up.
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): No, like, take your intern too.
Amanda (as Museum person): I'm not gonna invite the intern to a party, man. Have you ever heard of workplace boundaries?
Eric (as Drew as Mothman): Oh, yeah. Totally understand. Alright. Bye. And then I hang up.
Amanda: Cool. So, you hear the sound of somebody like getting their coat on like zipping their bag and stuff as a – as the museum shop employee hangs up.
Eric: Nice. Okay. So, I think—
Lauren: Nice. One down!
Eric: I think there's only one employee, and she's an intern.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So, we, I think we're set. I think we can dazzle her with, like, more than $10 an hour.
Brandon: You know, you can give her—
Lauren: Yeah. Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Give her the cash money and it’s gonna be fine.
Eric (as Drew): Would you like $20?
Lauren: I can buy you a burrito from Chipotle. Would that be good?
Amanda: Quincy, is there any like routing knowledge that you are putting to the task here? Like, as you're approaching the museum, I'd love to know if people are still following you. I think we have our driving on lock. But is there anything that you want to contribute to this chase?
Lauren: Yeah, I do know the, the grid of the town pretty well, because I do like to know where the actual train tracks are.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Because it's, you know, fun to go look at them sometimes. So, I do—
Amanda: A lot. Whenever you can.
Lauren: – instruct Joel. As we – as we get closer, as we're about five minutes out—
Amanda: Yes.
Lauren: – I do know that there is like a service road behind the museum—
Amanda: Excellent.
Lauren (as Quincy): – that you can kind of sneak up on. And, so, I kind of – I, I lean forward and sort of like say to Joel like, “Okay. Yeah.”
Brandon (as Joel): Aah!
Briggon (as Manheim): Huh.
Brandon (as Joel): Why are you so close to this?
Lauren (as Quincy): Just take a right up here. And then – and then take the second left and then another right. And we'll behindthe museum.
Brandon (as Joel): Okay.
Amanda: Alright.
Brandon (as Joel): I do that.
Briggon (as Manheim): I'd like – I'd like to grab my go-bag and pull out the makeup that's in there. And start applying it to everyone's faces to look like different cryptids.
[snickers]
Amanda: Oh.
Lauren (as Quincy): Oooh.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: That's a bold strategy.
Briggon (as Manheim): Yeah.
Amanda: Great. Why don't you both give me three D6 rolls, please?
Briggon (as Manheim): Sweet.
Amanda: Lauren and Briggon.
Briggon: Can you give me more dice?
Lauren: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Briggon: Oh.
Lauren: Thank you.
Briggon: Roll better.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Let’s start with Lauren.
Lauren: I got 3 and 6 for 9.
Amanda: Nice. Cool. So, you, you give correct routing. But there – it's gonna be like a better-lit service road than you thought. It's also very dusty. And there are kind of some discernible tracks that are leading into your alternate route. So, you may have lost your pursuers for now, but they will not be far behind.
Lauren: Okay. How where's the light coming from?
Amanda: Sort of, like—
Lauren: Like, it is a museum outdoor lights or something? Or—
Amanda: So, the museum, very into darkness.
Lauren: Right.
Amanda: So, they do not have a well-lit parking lot, but the, the road leading there is well lit.
Lauren: Okay.
Amanda: So, as your pursuers catch up on you – probably, they're about like six/seven minutes behind – they will be able to see what way you went.
Lauren: Gotcha.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Because I know – I know a little bit of electricity too because I need to know that for trains. So—
Amanda: That is true. Let's wait on that for a moment. Briggon, how'd you go?
Briggon: 5 and a 2. Yeah.
Amanda: Got it. So, what is your intention here? What do – what do you want to achieve with your makeup?
Briggon: Well, we just – you know, we called about a party. And, so, I just want to confuse the person even more.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: As if you are like dressing up as cryptids for the party or as if these are real cryptids for the party.
Briggon: Actual cryptids.
Amanda: Okay.
Briggon: Yeah.
Brandon: Maybe they got lost on, and they’re like, “Oh, where's – where's the party?
Eric: Yep.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Yup.
Amanda: Because what you do achieve is looking like people dressing up as cryptids.
Brandon: Great.
Amanda: So—
Briggon: It’s great.
Lauren: Okay.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: That works out
Amanda: It is a different effect, but it has an effect all the same.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: Great.
Briggon: Okay.
Eric (as Drew): I love this chupacabra thing!
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah, you're definitely chupacabra.
Eric (as Drew): I'm just like a – like, thank you for painting my face like the chupacabra!
Briggon: Yeah. Yeah, I think—
Amanda: Joel—
Briggon: – Joel will be an alien.
Brandon: Yeah, sounds right.
Briggon: And, Quincy, Pikachu
Lauren: Perfect, the ultimate cryptid.
Brandon: The famous cryptid. Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Detective or regular?
Briggon: Regular.
Brandon: Okay.
Briggon: Let’s not get crazy.
Lauren: Oh, okay. It’s disappointing.
Amanda: His tiny detective hat is still in the house.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Great. And, Drew, can you just give me one D6 roll, please, to see if you show your proficiency with stage makeup.
Eric: Oh.
[Dice rolls]
Eric: I rolled a 5.
Amanda: Yeah. You have strong opinions about sponging and foundation. And everyone is like, “Oh, chill, man. Chill, man. Okay.”
Eric (as Drew): That's not how they did it! That's not how they did it at Edinburgh.
Lauren (as Quincy): What?
Brandon (as Joel): Where?
Eric (as Drew): You know, the Edinburgh Community Center, where I did all of my community theater. I was in Fiddler... on the Roof? It was a rap performance
Amanda (as Mothman): In Scotland?
Eric (as Drew): What?
Amanda: Great. So, you've rolled up to the parking lot. You look like people hobbyists who have painted their own faces en-route to a cryptid party. And you are here. So, it looks like the only person whose cars in the parking lot is the intern, Janel. And I don't want to do anything before you kind of make your plan of attack. You do see in the background there is like a gate that's padlocked. And, behind that, you see kind of a large trailer-shaped object with some tarps over it.
Eric: Good. I was just gonna—
Lauren: I'm gonna go and try and break the padlock with my hands.
Brandon: Do I—
Eric: Fuck, fuck yeah, dude. Rip – rip it.
Amanda: Yeah. Fuck yeah.
Brandon: I look into my wallet. Do I just have like inexplicably, like, hundred dollar bills like all dads do? Just—
Lauren: Yeah.
Brandon: But like an obscene amount of cash for an adult human being in this world.
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Yeah
Eric: Oh, yeah, like 2020.
Lauren: And like 2020.
Eric: Yeah, definitely.
Amanda: Yeah.
Briggon: I'm gonna put a little bit of the rocket fuel into the gas tank of our car.
Amanda: Ooh.
Lauren: Getaway Car!
Briggon: Just in case, because it’s Science.
Amanda: Let's roll – let’s roll for that all chemical reaction, please.
Briggon: Yeah. Three, right?
Amanda: Three.
Briggon: Yeah. Okay
[Dice Rolls]
Eric: Because you're an astronaut and a scientist—
Amanda: Astronauts need to know about fuel.
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: Nearly a one, but, instead, you got a 5 and a 6. You totally nuzz up that vehicle, man.
Briggon: Sweet.
Eric: There’s a nuzz button like steam come out of the dash now.
Amanda: It’s grippin’ and rippin’. And it’s ready to go.
Lauren: Nitro.
Brandon: I also realized, when I see Quincy walk over towards the padlock, I opened the trunk and pull out like a hammer.
Eric: Smart.
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric: There are—
Lauren (as Quincy): But, like, you have like a bolt cutters-
Brandon (as Joel): Yeah, I have bolt cutters.
Lauren (as Quincy): – right there?
Brandon (as Joel): Yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): Great.
Brandon (as Joel): And a crowbar? Yeah.
Lauren (as Quincy): Cool.
Eric (as Drew): Would you like – but, like, you just keep digging this shit out. You need this laser level, too?
Lauren (as Quincy): Because at the—
Brandon (as Joel): Do you – do you need a laser level? Is that—
Lauren (as Quincy): I could – I could use – I could use the wire cutters. No, the bolt cutters.
Brandon (as Joel): Okay. Okay.
Lauren (as Quincy): Yeah.
Amanda: You can use it later at the party.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yes!
Amanda: Yeah. Great.
Eric: Can you imagine someone on the rave with a laser level.
Amanda: That’d be fucking stick, bro. I don't know what you’re saying.
Eric: Ta, na, na, na, na, na. This, this thing gets done. Ta, na, na, na, na. Ta, na, na, na, na.
Amanda: Excellent. Cool. So, let's get a roll from Quincy. You are very strong. So, let's get three. And then, Brandon, if you could give me a roll with three D6, we'll see how helpful your tools are.
[Dice Rolls]
Lauren: That is eight.
Brandon: I got 8 as well.
Amanda: Excellent!
Brandon: 8 twins!
Amanda: So, it's going to take you, like, three or four minutes to get through this lock, but you're going to get through it.
Brandon: Lovely.
Amanda: Great. In the meantime, is there anything that Drew/Octavio wants to do? I think Mothman is sort of hunkered down in the car, but then, as soon as he catches sight of his trailer, he's going to throw off the astronaut helmet. Sorry, bud. He's going to run – bolts over that kind of, like, waist-high gate. Like, a car, you know, blocking the driveway-style gate. And then run back toward the trailer.
Eric: Oh. So, now, he's in there.
Lauren: Oh, it's not like a tall fence?
Amanda: No, it's like – you know, like a private driveway.
Lauren: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Amanda: Like a – like a stable. Yeah.
Lauren: I like how you have me like really struggling with this lock at a fence that sort of comes up like--
Amanda: Do you need to—
Brandon: Well, we have to – have to drive the van out.
Lauren: Yes. Yeah, it’s true.
Amanda: We definitely need to break it. We can’t just walk in.
Eric: Damn. I think – I don't know if I can do any of these things. But I want to, like, get my fan to chill out a little bit, because I will – can I do something before Mothman runs away?
Amanda: Yeah, you can – you can roll and see where you catch him in his – in his escape. What do you want to say to him?
Eric: I think, now that I look like the chupacabra and I know everyone's friends. I'm like--
Eric (as Drew): “Mothman, look at this friendly face. There's no reason to get worried. Everything's going to work out.”
Amanda: Any kind of like pop culture parallels you're trying to draw here with your Netflix proficiency?
Eric: I think, at this point—
Amanda: Or, are you gonna make a switch? Are you gonna can unmask yourself there?
Eric: I think I need to unmask myself. I think it's getting to the point where it's happening.
Amanda: And remind me of Octavio’s proficiencies again.
Eric: Octavio’s proficiencies is knowing famous people and Shakespeare.
Briggon: Su-super helpful.
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric: So, I think that he does the thing. Like, you know in The Good Place when Jameela Jamil’s character – like, she – all she does is like game drop people—
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric: – in ridiculous situations. So, that we – listen, that was what I – would happen with a Nick Cage thing. So, I think that he's just like-
Eric (as Drew): I remember the time that my good friend – I remember the time that my good friend, Marty Scorsese, was worried about his friends leaving him around. But we hung out and everything was fine ultimately. And that's when he won his 20th Oscar in the future for Irishman V: More Irishman.
Brandon (as Joel): You know Martin Scorsese?
Eric (as Octavio): I do, because – I'm sorry, Joel. I've seen my poster on your wall. And I think this was an inopportune time, but I am in fact your idol and hero, Octavio Redwine, Shakespearean actor and mild movie star. I was in that BBC Show you like as well.
Brandon (as Joel): Oh. My. God!
Brandon: I pass out.
Amanda: Great. I was gonna ask you to roll for how you reacted, but you just took care of that for me, which I appreciate
Eric: There’s nothing Brandon likes more than nerfing his own character.
Amanda: So, Mothman is actually very touched by this. So, let's do – let's do three D6 and see how this affects Mothman.
Eric: Oh, shit. Just a 6.
Amanda: Okay. Great.
Amanda (as Mothman): If you actually knew Marty, man, you know that he would never make a sequel to something like that. It was his – it was his masterpiece. It was self-contained. And there's no way he would have followed up IP, man. Like you don't even know him at all.
Eric (as Octavio): I know. But he invested in SpaceX. That was the problem.
Briggon: Oh, SpaceX.
Eric: Yes.
Brandon: I can’t go on after that.
Eric: OK. I should have—
Briggon: I was wondering.
Eric: I was wondering about the silence there.
Brandon: What did I say?
Amanda: So—
Briggon: Manny is recognizing that it's still tense.
Amanda: Yes.
Briggon: And walks up to Mothman and pulls out of his go-bag some little, like, rhinestones that you put on, on clothing.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: What’s in your go-bag?
Briggon (as Mannheim): And just – just says to Mothman, “You look really nice today by the way, I don't think anyone said that. But you look really nice.”
Amanda (as Mothman): Oh, thanks. It's just it's hard when you sort of losing motivation and sort of crashing on couches like between places. Like, your place is great. Don't get me wrong, but, like, the mirror only shows kind of like my chest. And, like, it's hard to just see the full picture, and thanks.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Well, it's amazing. And I think like – do you mind? And he – I grab the rhinestones. And I start to motion for your collarbone.
Amanda: Let's do three D6, please.
Briggon: Cool.
Eric: You're gonna bejewel Mothman?
Briggon: I'm doing a makeover.
[Dice Rolls]
Briggon: 4, 4, 8.
Eric: Nice.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: Mothman is fucking into it.
Eric: Nice.
Amanda: And not all of them are gonna stick.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: So, it might not have quite the effect that you intended.
Briggon: That’s fine. We’re just trying to make a connection here.
Amanda: Yeah.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: Definitely, he feels connected. He’s still kind of like looking over his shoulder toward the camper van.
Briggon: Yeah.
Amanda: But he is – he is appreciating the person to person connection.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Hey, Mothman, you know what?
Amanda (as Mothman): What?
Briggon (as Mannheim): You look really fierce.
Amanda (as Mothman): Oh, thanks, man. Is it like – do they do motivational speeches in astronaut training? Because I just need to know a lot more about that program.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yes.
Amanda (as Mothman): Wow.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Amanda (as Mothman): I was planning to reconsider my life plan, you know? Like, it's pretty – it's like a dream, but it's reality.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Hey, after all this, if you want to, like, talk about plans for the future, like, just hit me up, you know?
Amanda (as Mothman): Well, thanks, man.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Yeah.
Amanda: And then some lights come on in the museum.
Eric: It's what my commander RuPaul always says, “We're all born naked, and the rest is fracked. Now, go into space.”
Amanda: And, like, Ru coming into the workroom, you will see front door of the museum fly open. And then there is the intern, Janel, who looks exceedingly well put together for someone working on a Cryptid Museum.
Lauren: Hmm. How am I doing on this – on the lock?
Amanda: I think you've just broken through the lock.
Lauren: Yes!
Amanda: Great. So, how do you guys react?
Eric: I think we just get them in and let's just fucking—
Lauren: Get on it?
Eric: It's an intern. Let's just fucking do it.
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric: We have – we have rocket fuel. Like, let's just do it.
Amanda: So, as Mothman runs back toward the camper and he can kind of deal with trying to get it started up, anyone want to help him with that?
Lauren: I'll go. Yeah.
Amanda: Great. Maybe some engine troubleshooting.
Lauren: Exactly. Yeah.
Amanda: That’d be very helpful. And is anyone going to talk to or go after, Janel? She's kind of standing on the stoop. Like, trying to take in the situation. Like--
Amanda (as Janel): what, what are you guys doing here?
Lauren: Oh, wait. Is-is Joel still passed out on the ground?
Eric: I’ll take Jo—
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: Okay. I pick up Joel and throw him over my shoulder.
Amanda: Excellent. I don't need to make you roll for it. You know, how to do that.
Eric: Briggon, are you gonna put a rocket fuel in the camper?
Briggon: Yeah. That’s what I was thinking. Yeah.
Eric: So, I'll talk to her if you put rocket fuel in the camper.
Amanda: Oh, nice. Beautiful. Okay. So, Joel, Quincy, and Mannheim are heading back in pursuit—
Briggon (as Mannheim): Thank you for using my full first name.
Amanda: Oh, you’re welcome. In pursuit of Mothman. And, Octavio, what is your strategy here with Janel?
Eric (as Octavio): I think I'm just gonna reveal the thing. I'm just gonna be like, “Hello, ma'am. I am Octavio Redwine, renowned actor. You might have seen me on that BB show – BB – BBC Show you like a lot.”
Amanda (as Janel): What?! You just wake up?
Lauren: Jostling adventure.
Amanda: Do you – do you pass down to like the second level of Inception and, now, time is going 10 times as long for you?
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: Oh, beans. Okay. We should check on that.
Eric (as Octavio): I know. I was in the third season of Killing Eve. I was Killed by Eve! Do you remember? I'm here to do a role. And I need you to keep this quiet. But I want to be a – someone who works at a Cryptid Museum for a movie I'm doing with [5 beats of silence] Benedict Cumberbatch. He's playing a monster. I know, right? What is it like for your job?
Amanda (as Janel): Man, there was absolutely no higher role for him than that role with Johnny Lee Miller as Frankenstein is broadcast via MTLive. Oh, my god! I can't believe it. I-uhh...
Amanda: Give me three D6.
Eric: Okay.
[Dice roll]
Eric: Come on. Be amazed at my acting. A 6 and a 5. Yeah, 11. Bang, bang.
Lauren: Nice!
Amanda (as Janel): It would be my honor to show you every single facet of this very boring job. Would you like to come in?
Eric (as Octavio): I would love to. Haha! That also looks like Benedict. It's just like a – it's like a shrunken head. And I'm just pointing out things that look like Benedict Cumberbatch.
Amanda (as Janel): Does – does he really go by Benedict?
Amanda: And then we're gonna just fade out as you guys go inside. Great. So, let's go to the backyard. Mothman is trying to start up the camper, but it is not starting. So, let's see what kind of help we can lend him.
Lauren: Okay. Yeah. Is Joel still passed out?
Brandon: Can I make a roll to see if I wake up?
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: What should I do? One or two?
Amanda: You can do two dice, please.
Eric: Now that I'm outside of your range.
Brandon: Eight.
Amanda: You do wake up. You're a little bit kind of clumsy as you're coming out of sleep or passed out-ness.
Brandon: Yeah. Yeah.
Amanda: But, yes, you are getting there.
Eric: The kick happens. You see – you see your top is spinning and, you know—
Brandon: Well, so—
Amanda: And Tom Hardy almost kisses you.
Brandon: As every dad has a really unrevealed but weird and out of character backstory, I know how to hotwire cars from my teenage days.
Amanda: Extraordinary.
Eric: Nice.
Amanda: Amazing. So, you get three D6 to start up the van. And I'll also ask the same from Quincy.
Lauren: Yeah, I'm gonna look – I’m gonna look under the hood.
Amanda: Using your engine knowledge.
Briggon: Oh, I'm sorry.
Amanda: And you look great while doing it, Quince. So ripped.
Lauren (as Quincy): Thanks. The arms are really working.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Pikapi!
Lauren: 7.
[laughter]
Brandon: I got an 8.
Lauren: I got a 7.
Amanda: Okay. Great. So, it's gonna take you a few minutes, but you are going to get the car going.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: You're able to hotwire it. But let's try to make sure with Quincy skills that it doesn't like cut out or have this problem again when Mothman gets to where he’s going.
Lauren: Would it also be – I don't know anything about – Lauren doesn't know anything about cars. Would it help if, while Joel's hot wiring it, I went behind and pushed it to like give it a little bit of that like, motion?
Amanda: It sure would. Three D6, please.
Lauren (as Quincy): Okay.
(Dice rolls)
Lauren (as Quincy): That is a 7 also.
Amanda: Great. So, it is helpful, but there are some kind of fits and starts. So, Mothman is inside. Mothman is very anxiously going through all of his possessions. Like--
Amanda (as Mothman): “Oh, man, I hope they didn't get rid of that phone book from 1972, which has a heavy encoded messages in it that I traded with Bigfoot before cellphones, which is much harder.”
Brandon (as Mothman): All my Digimon cards!
Amanda (as Mothman): Darn. All my pogs are gone!
Briggon: We probably-- rocket fuel, right?
Lauren: Yeah, into the sky.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah, put the rocket fuel.
Lauren: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Briggon: But if we put it in, it'll just launch though, right? That’s how that works.
Lauren: Into the sky.
Eric: I assumed that it was like, now, it has nuzz. Like, you're in a—
Lauren: Yeah.
Eric (as Drew): You're in a Fast and Furious Movie.
Amanda: Once it starts. Yeah, once it starts.
Brandon: You know the camper they had in Fast and Furious.
Briggon: Yeah. Oh, my god, my favorite.
Amanda: The one that they take to space in FastX?
Eric: Yeah. Oh, I was just gonna say FastX. Mind Meld, it happens.
Briggon: So, I want to put that in.
Amanda: Great.
Briggon: Yeah,
Amanda: Yeah. So, you're able to put it in. Janel is thoroughly distracted. What else are you telling her about or asking her?
Eric: I think it's just a lot of – it’s, honestly, just like a lot of me pointing to different things and be like-
Eric (as Octavio): “Benedict looked like this. Nick looks like this.”
Eric: And it's just like one is just the little – like little green men statues.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Another one is the chupacabra. Another just like some skeletons that like – you know, like those fake skeletons, where they definitely just graft a bunch of shit together.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: So, it's like a skeleton with like two heads. I'm like, “That definitely looks like Benedict. Hahahahaha.”
Amanda: Janel is taking notes furiously.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: And asks you to sign a napkin.
Eric: Oh, definitely.
Amanda: Great.
Eric (as Octavio): To my biggest fan, Janel, reach for the stars. Ha! Ha! Octavio Redwine.
Amanda: And how do you stylize haha?
Briggon: Yeah.
Eric: With exclamation points after both ha and ha.
Amanda: Oh, different words.
Lauren: Different words.
Eric: Yeah.
Lauren: Both capitalized?
Eric (as Octavio): Ha! Ha! Yes.
Amanda: Cool. Cool.
Brandon: That’s the worse.
Amanda: Great. So, with that, you are able to hotwire Mothman’s car. With Quincy’s help, it is rolling. So, it has a rolling start. And then, with Manny's rocket fuel, he's able to floor it extremely fast. The gate is open.
Briggon: Great.
Amanda: There are the kind of pursuers of the alien watchers that you kind of hear coming down the road, but they are not – they’re not here yet. So, he does have a clean breakaway. Anything you want to say to Mothman before he goes?
Brandon (as Joel): You still owe us rent!
Amanda (as Mothman): I’ll mail it to you, man.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Wait. The aliens are still coming though, right?
Amanda (as Mothman): Yeah. Good luck with that.
Lauren (as Quincy): Mothman!
Briggon (as Mannheim): Wait. Can you on your communication device, maybe?
Lauren (as Quincy): Can – can you text them?
Amanda (as Mothman): Oh, yeah. No, I’ll – what's your neighbor's house number? I'll tell them it was that one instead.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Oh, perfect.
Lauren (as Quincy): Text them to land on Eric Schneider’s house.
Amanda (as Mothman): You got it.
Amanda: And Mothman pauses for a moment because he does not text and drive, you're welcome. And you see him take a cheeky little selfie and then write in the snapshot text over it. Your one-off. It's next door, the neighbor with the weird grass.
Brandon: (Gasp). Yeah.
Lauren: Amazing.
Eric: And the two – the two – the two Boston terriers.
Briggon: Insert Eric Schneider’s real address.
Amanda: Octavio, you come out of the museum. And you see Mothman finishing his snap and getting back behind the wheel to peel out.
Eric: I think that I put my arms around all three of my roommates. And I say,
Eric (as Octavio)“Oh, what a good day in the life of an Everyman. Now, let's go get those brewskis.”
Brandon: I faint.
Amanda: Great. The employees who spoke to earlier comes running out of the woods like, “They were out of Natty’s, man.” And then you see Mothman peel off into the dusk with the camper trailing dust. And then the tarp flies off. The alien mob comes into the parking lot not knowing that their quarry has just left. And, later on that evening, I don't know if you guys decide to spend it at a bar or something, because there is a lot going on next door. As Earth gets its first alien visitation witnessed by none other than one Eric Schneider, HOA enthusiasts, and his two misbehaving dogs, Henry and Herman.
[Players yells affirmatively]
Eric: Yay!
Brandon: Yay!
Lauren: Yay!
Briggon: Yay!
Eric: Mothman
Lauren: Mothman.
Eric: Mothmen.
Amanda: We're all Mothmen now.
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: Can we do – can we do like an American Graffiti style like ending credits, where it all says where we are now?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric (as Octavio): Okay. Octavio Redwine: starred in the new Seth MacFarlane feature, Everyman and Farts. It did poorly at the box office, but we got occult following on, on Netflix. He died two months later.
Lauren: Dark.
Amanda: Dark.
Brandon (as Joel): Joel: fixed the leaky sink.
Amanda: Excellent.
Brandon (as Joel): Died two months later.
Eric: Coincidentally, died two months later.
Lauren (as Quincy): Inspired by his visit to the Cryptid Museum, Quincy: opened his own Train Museum.
Amanda: Aww. Lovely.
Brandon: Died two months later.
Lauren (as Quincy): Two months later after being run over by a tiny, but very strong train.
Briggon (as Mannheim): Mannheim opened a Etsy Shop of home-crafted looks on the moon or did he?
Amanda: Did you die two months later or did you disappear two months later?
Briggon: Disappeared.
Amanda: Didn't think that, as a GM, all my players would nerf themselves at the end of the day. But—
Eric: I like it. In all of our obituaries – in all of our obituaries, we're all survived by Mannheim. That’s it.
Amanda: Great. And, and Mothman remembers you all fondly and drives by the house every now and again to make sure the grass is any length, but regulation.
Briggon: Alright.
Lauren: Aww.
Eric: Yay!
Brandon: Yay!
Lauren: Yay!
Amanda: Yay!

Transcript
Eric: Hey, hi, hello, Join The Party listeners. It’s me, Eric. And it’s just gonna be me. If that freaks you out, turn it off right now. I’ll give you a second to wait for it. Alright, well the rest of you who are staying... [laughs]
So we’re in the in-between-times between campaign one and campaign two. I can’t believe that the Concentric States arc is over and now we’re doing this other thing. I don’t think I’ve prepared creatively for anything else I’ve ever done in my life more than I have for this Join The Party thing. So I’m ready. I’m so excited to play. You’re gonna be- it’s gonna be great.
But, in the meantime, we did say we were gonna have some one-shots and I thought this would be a great time for me to go onto itch.io - for those of you who don’t know, it's like a tabletop and games compository - that's not a word, but you know what I’m talking about - where you can find indie games and just buy them and pick them up.
So I heard about this recommended on ‘Friends at the Table’ and this is from the Emotional Mecha Game Jam. So they do Game Jams where people just kind of make up games or - as quickly as possible - and this was for the Emotional Mecha one. Basically, the Emotional MechaJam people put together games that were about mechs and feelings, and this is one of the games that came out of it.
So me, by myself, am going to - I am going to play the game ‘Plot Armor’ by a game designer called DC. So I’m going to walk you through this and then we’re going to play the game, and then we’ll see what happens.
So you can also buy this. We’ll have the link in the episode description, and it’s seven dollars. Just pick this up. Games are worth your money. Independent game people are worth the money. I have never felt this more than speiding all the time and energy editing and formatting, and sourcing that we did for the Labor Party modules. I’m like - it’s not even that much! You can just buy - you’re giving me money for the things that came out of my brain? That sounds great! And I’m really excited to support a game designer like this, and we’re going to play ‘Plot Armor’ together.
So for those of you, I guess who have met me in person, I’m a big fan of, like, the anime-mecha genre. I think this comes from ‘Friends at the Table’. I like the idea that people go into mechs and it’s emotional, and it’s big robots fighting is wild. I’m not like an anime fan all that much, like I’ve watched some. I used to watch Toonami back in the day and I kind of housed all of ‘My Hero Academia’. So some of these tropes I don't know as well, but of course I play tons of games, and I watch tons of TV shows and I read all of this stuff, so I think this is a fun exercise for me to kind of stretch into it.
And I am kind of making a robot-mecha anime as we go along. The way that this game is paced is that you're a pilot who is looking back on his life as a pilot of a mech and you're writing journal entries about it. So all I really need is a journal, which I have my microphone right here and Brandon listening to me, so every so often my journal is going to slightly titter back at me if I make a joke, which is good or not. And then I need one d6, so I have my dice right here and you can hear that now. [rolls die]. Did you hear it? Did they hear it? Brandon says they heard it, which is pretty good. So I had everything that I need right here. So let’s get started.
Plot Armor is a single player RPG about perception, truth, and fate. Your character is the protagonist of a 32-episode mecha anime. I looked on the website and it said that the optimal game is 24 episodes, so I think I’m gonna do 24 episodes because I am worried about speaking all of this into existence. During these 32 episodes, or 24 episodes, your protagonist will slowly come to realize that reality is not what it seems. They have Plot Armor, which is the ability to survive any and all situations that they may face due to being the main character of the story. However, your protagonist will unknowingly die at the end of Episode 32, or 24 in my case.
So let’s talk about the setting. You can choose any setting for your 24 episodes, as long as they contain the following. 1) There is a mecha known as Armor, so the mechs are known as Armor. There will be mech fighting or conflict. There will be unimaginably difficult situations to escape or overcome without immense luck and/or impossible skill. And there will be a hot springs episode which is optional.
Brandon’s looking at me weird. A ‘hot springs’ episode is where everyone just kind of hangs out at a hot spring. It’s like in between the season you want just the people talking to each other, but they’re outside of the mech and people don’t fight. They just hang out literally at a hot springs. The mech- [laughs] Brandon just asked me if the mech was nude and… I would say no. No one is necessarily nude, I think. It’s also kind of funny, it is gendered in that way. It’s like the boys talk to each other and the girls talk to each other. Sometimes they talk to - but it’s fine. This is funny, Brandon doesn’t know anything about anime, so it’s funny.
Um, let’s see. Let’s talk about the setting. I was thinking that the setting… because it can be any sort of anime I want as long as it has those things, it uses mechs and they're called armor. I feel like, and this might be from watching ‘His Dark Materials’ with Amanda so much, but I like the idea that at some age, the people in the world get mechs- like it’s very much like a bar mitzvah. It’s a symbol that you’re an adult. And I think there must be some sort of compulsory draft or something. I know they still do a draft in Israel that as soon as you turn 18, you can do - have to do anything, but of course things in the draft you might not necessarily be fighting, you can do all this stuff.
So I think there might be something about there being a country that has a compulsory draft because - and when you are a teenager, you get a mech -it’s like the mech finds you, so I feel like… I wonder how they get- I wonder how they get the mechs. See this is the thing about me is that I get lost in - in plot. I get lost in plot so much. Maybe like when you’re 13, your birthday present is you go to the mech - like the mech department store. Maybe it’s like Robots-R-Us or, um… it must be like more - because I think in my head it’s very clinical. It’s like yes this is what happens. You know, when you first get to the point where your doctor starts asking you if you are having sex. And then like those [laughs] Brandon laughed because I said sex. Um, when you have different questions and you're responsible for your own body and stuff, so I feel like this is similar.
It must be like an institute. It’s like the Robotics Institute of this country. And they have a- like you spend five years getting used to your mech. And I think your mech is probably has some sort of like pleasing version, because it very much like in ‘His Dark Materials’, the animal or the daemon finds you and matches your personality.
So the mech has some sort of like randomly generated AI personality and also turns into some sort of animal or something that can fit - maybe probably fits in a backpack, and then of course when it activates, it’s a mech suit, and you can put it on and it is similar to the small version. Like that’s the name of your - that’s the name of your mech is a nickname or something related to the animal you have, so like if you have a dog and it had a spot on it, your mech - it’s like this is my mech Spot. And then even when you're in there that’s like your callsign because the person and the mech are the same.
So I think that’s interesting and then they are fighting, if it’s a compulsory draft, I think this is one of those - like ‘Ender's Game’ style, they're just like fighting aliens or like Halo, like when you can - for those of you who play video games, it’s like when you play Halo for the first time and you have to convince your parents because it’s M rated, and it’s like no we’re killing aliens it’s fine! Or like in ‘Enders Game; they were fighting some just like enemy out there and I think it has to be like that. I wonder if there’s - there’s another thing where you are just like - like the fighting of the aliens, has to do with this. Or similar - I guess similar to ‘Arrival’ how just like the aliens show up and you just, and they just need to deal with it and there's perpetual conflict which I think stokes a lot of this, whatever neo-country we’re living in. It can be like the neo-United States honestly like what if in 19- or like 2005, no probably earlier like in 1991, because that's when I was born, all of a sudden aliens just started coming down an there was a mech program and then all new children had to - it could be like in the DC area even - all children that turn thirteen now go to the Robotics Institute and get their mechs at thirteen and then you learn - you get used to them for five years then you go off and fight or do whatever you have to do in the army.
I also like that it’s thirteen, because this is something that I’m very fascinated with history, is that ages, or people, or like reasons are so arbitrary, so maybe like the director of the Robotics Institute or the Robotics Program is just Jewish, and they're like “Hey when should people start getting mechs?” and it’s like “Thirteen, that’s when the Bar Mitzvah is.” I just kind of like that a lot.
Let’s see - the protagonist. So I just did a lot of world-building, congratulations Eric. [laughs] Uh, I think there’s also something interesting about fighting an immobile thing, so maybe they come down like asteroids, like as an asteroid belt sort of thing. Like people are shooting asteroids at the United States and you’ve gotta like blow them up. That may be good. And then there are things inside of the asteroids which might develop over the season. I think that’s interesting. Um, so you’re - the mech is the 18-year-old children go up into space and fight with the mechs that they've come to love over five years.
Um, protagonist, so let’s go to the next part. What’s important about creating your protagonist is their mecha show archetype. The reluctant hero, an emotional genius, completely inexperienced but full of heart, the child prodigy, for honor and/or country, to end suffering, and a foolish perception of being a pilot. These archetypes are not binding as your character may hit more than one during play, but consider theme is an optional foundation for what to build off of as well as the potential moments in your character’s story. The one I’m really drawn to here is “Completely inexperienced, full of heart.” In my head, I like - and this is from ‘My Hero Academia’ - is that like the new normal is having superpowers in that anime, but in this one the new normal is getting the robot but its like there needs to be a heavy process about being chosen, but -
So maybe they go to the Robotics Institute - the robotics where the mech - the Armor Warehouse? Yeah, it’s like Men’s Wearhouse, Armor Warehouse, or the Armor Institute, maybe Armor is some sort of arcane initialism. And they go down there when they are thirteen and no mech suit chooses them. I think there’s some idea like this is your - like who is supposed to be a representative of you and there has to be - either is literally like the mech chooses you or there’s the metaphorical the mech chooses you, and it just doesn't happen. It’s like he goes back to his mom and his mom’s like “Oh what mech - what's in your bag” like the children all have backpacks, like that’s where you keep your mech, and of course he comes back and the backpack isn't full.
So maybe and it’s like he’s a - it has to be, it’s always a guy in these - in mech anime unfortunately so I think it has to be a dude here. And he’s just like, “Yeah I didn’t find one. It didn't choose me.” And they just didn't have a mech in there of our problems, because of course like they get bullied - like middle school and all that stuff for not having a mech. And maybe, I don't know, they like got beat up after school and - actually no maybe I should save this for the first episode. I’m gonna save this, I have some ideas. I’ll come back to this. So let’s start by playing a game. We’re gonna get started. So we’re gonna begin on Episode 1. I’m going to pick an arbitrary awesome-sounding star date to track time with. And title your episode as such. Their example is 12A-B011-XX, Where It All Began. Episode 1. Your first episode must include the following plot points: how you became a pilot, your expectations for the future, what greater conflict you're enlisting in facing, how you feel about said conflict, and your relationship with armor. Cool.
These character pieces help establish your past, your present, your future, and solidify your character archetype. If during the game you run out of motivations or ideas on how to continue, come back to these pieces for inspiration. Your character is chronicling each episode after it happened, so use the past tense. This is the case for every episode except for the final one. And then I’m gonna cover what happens … When I’m done with the first episode, I’m going to cover how we progressed through the game. So we’re gonna start with the episode - I had to grab a journal. I do think it’s important to have a journal on you because it’s nice writing down the episodes. Because you're going to see the d6 is how the episodes progress forward. I’m going to get to that more when I do it, but I think I am going to need to keep track of my anime a little bit. My 24- [laughs] my 24 season thing.
Um, let’s see… they just kind of use numbers, but I like the idea of this like - there’s like a BC, AD sort of thing. Again, just because Jesus like, “Let’s just start recording our stuff after Jesus was there! That’s fine. There was a time before, but then after that counting differently!” So I feel like it needs to be - if we’re going off of 1991, because 1991 is like the flash point, or it’s like the falling - like “After Falling Star” or something, so maybe it’s like - and like they just have totally - and it’s now - they don’t have months anymore, it’s just seasons.
Or there are only three seasons because like the asteroids are messing with it, so it’s like the season is just like - like there’s a monsoon season, there’s like dry, mon-[laughs] there’s, um… desert, no I think one is definitely monsoon, so one season is monsoon, the other one is just like twilight because maybe it's like - I mean everything that’s happening literally in Australia right now, how just like it’s colored because of dust in the air and smoke, so it might just be called, if you want to be romantic about it, twilight. And there needs to be like a dry season. I think just like it’s - [sighs] I like the idea that it’s romantic, though, so maybe it’s like Sun or Sol.
Yeah, the three seasons now are Monsoon, Twilight, and Sol, and it’s also “After Falling Sky,” so it’s AFS. I think the - let’s see if it’s ‘91, let’s make this like a neo, so it’s like 52. Okay. Alright, so the first episode is AFS52 Monsoon. So After the Falling Star year 52 in monsoon season, because like days don't matter anymore [laughs] we all lost our days after the stars fell. Oh shit! [laughs] I’m gonna write that down! That’s very good! Monsoon and the episode 1… I’m gonna call it “Episode 1: Last Picked.” alright, cool. So Episode 1 is called “Last Picked.” in AFS52, Monsoon. So all of these need to come from the past tense and should have all of these - should have all of these things. Let’s see… [pauses then chuckles to self] Oh my god. I’m trying to think of how, like, maybe everybody is self-serious but things are pretty goofy. I guess it’s not very goofy. I guess everyone can be very self-serious. So…
Eric [in game]: Everything changed after the star-
Eric: [laughing] I can’t say that. That’s how ‘Airbender’ starts. I was like… oh… what did I say. Oh-
Eric [in game]: The days stopped mattering after the stars fell. When the star’s falling, where do the stars go? They just can’t keep falling in the sky - that’s not how physics works. We all learned that in our -
Eric: I think also the school has changed , I think, so it’s like -
Eric [in game]: We all learned that in our combat physics course. Falling things need to go somewhere. The point is that we know where they go and we can catch them in our armor. Our armor is more than just what protects us, we protect it. It’s all in the same really - and when I found my armor… well when I found my armor, I knew I had to protect more than just me. I was protecting everyone.
Eric: [sighs] I need to come up with a - his name is like… I wonder if he’s also - you're named after the season you were born in, so if he’s like, this kid is now nineteen or eighteen, so he’s probably named in the Twilight time so maybe he was, uh… or in between, if you’re a cusp baby it’s about that so he’s… I think he’s just named Sunset Park. That’s a good name. Last name Park, first name Sunset.
Eric [in game]: My name is Sunset Park and I’m the greatest pilot that the Neo-American Armor Class ever had. And I have to tell you where it began, because I wasn't always like this. I didn't even have an armor to start with. It’s not even about me, it’s about the armor. The armor is what brought me to greatness. I can see why it was left out in the trash that day. Everyone knew who I was. I guess I was kind of a local celebrity. I was the kid when they turned thirteen, when they got bar mitzvahed in the eyes of the country…
Eric: [laughs] That’s also a pretty fucking good line, I’m gonna have to write that down.
Eric [in game]: When I was bar mitzvahed in the eyes of the country, I went down to the Institute like every kid did. We all went in groups. I was part of the- I was part of the Sol- the Sol group. I know I kind of got born in the liminal spaces between, but it’s not really up to me, it’s whatever the teacher says. All of us went up together and we were going to the Armor Institute to pick up our mechs.
Everyone knew that your armor said something about you. If you had a small armor that was fast and sleek, you’d probably be part of the Delivery Corps, running packages all over the country and people will salute you for your services, maybe give you a few dollars so you could pick up a cold drink at the end of the day. If you got - if you got a big mech, if you’ve got a big armor, one that towered over buildings, it could really mean anything. It could mean that you would be the first person in the - you would be fodder. You'd be shot at. Or maybe you'd just be suited for construction. That one was kind of just up for interpretation.
Depending on how many legs your armor had, you’d be lucky if you'd be able to find it later as it transformed into a bug that would pop into your - it would be transformed into a bug as it popped into your backpack. It wasn’t as much as the armor was when it was out. It was when it was in that meant just as much. Obviously it all fit in a backpack. Every single one fit in a backpack. But if you could find it and not break it, well that was a challenge for you as a thirteen-year-old.
But me, I never got an armor. Not in the way everybody else did. When I went to the Institute I waded and I waded through the boxes and I looked up high and I went up low. I even went to the fifth floor, which only kids that really don't know what they're doing need to be guided around by the technicians up there. I went everywhere.
I went back to my mom with my backpack in hand and she asked, “Well, you got- where’s the armor? Is it a bug? Is it a little butterfly?” and I said, “No. I didn't get one.” And I don't know if it’s true necessarily, but I felt like I heard everybody gasp. Maybe it was just me. Maybe it was just my mom. But it resonated over that room bounding off of all of the mechs in their small puppy-sized or cat-sized or bird-sized bodies.
So I was a kid without a mech. I was the kid without armor. And of course, that only allows you to get bullied more, right? I didn't even mean to make it a metaphor. I think it just is. They locked me in lockers because I had no way to get out of it. And I would bang and bang until the janitor, who still walked around with his calico armor licking between its- his - licking between his feet when he would finally let me out. I think by the twentieth time I would just kind of wait. I knew Mr. Roberts’ routines. And he would come around once he got his second Coke. But before the second Fanta. Never wanted to be there once he got his second Fanta.
In the future, I had always hoped I would be a great pilot, fighting the asteroids that would fall down upon the earth. Maybe I’d be the first one to figure out where they came from. Maybe I would be the first line of defense. I don't know. For now, I was just worried about getting to the end of the day. It was at the end of that that I finally kicked - I kicked my way out of the locker. Because I could figure it out on my own. My mom wasn’t going to be home for another few hours, so I didn't have a ride or anything, so I just walked home. It was six hour- it was six miles if I went a long way, but no one wanted to go the short way, so I went the long way.
Out by the trash that I walked by, I felt like someone was pulling at my jacket as I was walking by a mini-mall with a closed shoe shop- with a closed shoe store, and an old arcade and a very specialty grocery store that only sold turnip-based items. So amongst all the turnip soup and the turnip hot dogs in a pile, there - what seemed to be...well, most of the other armors they’re animals. It just is their - they move around that way. Whoever created the armor wanted them to move around. But this was just a ball. It was about the size of a soccer ball, but - and maybe some of the patterns, but instead of being black and white, it was just black. You had to look very, very closely to see if - to even see the pattern, a gyroscope of different - of different shapes that twisted and… that twisted if you looked at it too long. And I did and it made my head hurt.
But I turned around and no one was there before, and I turned around again when I felt the tap again. And then I saw this ball. I thought someone had just kicked their really dirty soccer ball from the street. And I picked it up, and for the first time, I felt like this was - you just know someone is a friend immediately as you touch them. As I - well you know, I’m not touching people immediately. That’s probably why I didn't have as many friends. But immediately it slid onto me.
The colors of armors usually change depending on what the color of your animal is - the spot is the dog, we call it Spot. The bovine mechs I guess would have names like Bessy or Daisy, but this was all black. I don't know if it thought it was a cat, or it thought it was a bat, or thought it was something else, but it was just a ball and it slid onto me immediately. I didn't even have to try. And I finally felt, Yes, I’m protected. This is the armor. I can do it. And I’m gonna be the greatest asteroid-destroying mech pilot of this side of the Mississipp!
So I loved my armor, and my armor loved me.

Alright, let’s get back to the show.
[transition noise]
Eric: Alright, let’s see what Sunset does. So this is where I figure out what to do next. So once you feel that you've covered that episode fully, which I think I did. I feel like I’ve talked for a long time there, which is funny because this is a podcast where it’s just me. Uh, once I’ve covered that episode fully, I roll my d6. I’m going to take that result and add that to the number of your current episode number. So if I rolled a four and I was on episode one, I’m now on episode five. And then et cetera.
So once you know what episode your next journal entry is, you roll your d6 twice for one of the following sections to decide what happens to your protagonist and what happens to your armor. So- and I’m going to talk about chronicling the episode. So while chronicling each episode, I’m going to tell the story of whatever time skips might happen. This can be due to episode jumps or even my moving the star date forward by choice. Episode 24 can take place ten years after Episode 1 or ten days. Once you're finished chronicling the episode, I’m gonna roll our d6 again and choose the prompt for the next episode. I can interpret the prompt in any way that makes sense to me. Each one of these episodes will bring my protagonist closer to realizing they are an invincible impossible being. When they become sure of this truth and in what context is up to you. And then I’ll get to my finale as I get there.
So I’m gonna roll...
[rolls die]
Oh I rolled a six! So now I’m on Episode 7. Alright, so this is gonna be forward just one season. So this is AFS52 Twilight, Episode 7 and it’s called “Flight School Showdown.” I’m going to roll for my d6…
[rolls die]
I got a 3. I went berserk and slayed a friend and foe alike. And then the armor…
[rolls die]
Is a 2. It temporarily transformed. Okay. So this is already on Episode 7, so I think we’ve kind of already established this person getting the - Sunset Park getting his friends and all the other misfits, and all the misfits coming together. And they also like suspect that Sunset is a- they probably suspect that Sunset is a like - the... amazing at what they do. And they - Sunset just doesn't actually have any sort of control over the mech, it’s like the mech does things quicker than even Sunset - but like when they have to make an emotional choice, that’s when the person inside of the armor is like... They’re starting to quintessentially embody what it is- armor for so many other people I think is controlling it, but I think this all-black armor… I wonder what he names it. It probably is something… maybe it’s just like Midnight. Yeah, the armor is named Midnight. Because it doesn't have an animal name. Like he - Sunset has to tell people that it’s a black cat, but of course it’s just a rolling ball, so I think this is the flight show.
Immediately Sunset is drafied into - is immediately drafted because at his regular high school, he's just excelling far beyond everyone’s wildest things, and of course he can't do it, but he doesn't want to disappoint his teachers and his mom, and he wants to be better than all the bullies who bullied him, so I think he went immediately… there’s like a flight school, like he got drafted early, and of course it’s like hand waved of why a fifteen-year-old- why a fifteen-year-old is now in flight school immediately.
So I think he has a show-down where he’s challenged by like a hotshot who has a - I literally think he has a duck, a duck armor. And he has very big wings and aggressive mouth, like pincers when he turns into a mech. Most of the armors I guess they have jets, but I like that this one has literal wings, which makes him fly faster. He’s like more aerodynamic. He’s using the - what was it - what’s a duck name? I think it’s named Quack. Like Quack is the flight school bully and Sunset is going up against Quack and they're doing like - there’s a… I think there’s a series of challenges and I think this is where it picks up in the beginning.
Eric [in game]: I always remembered what it was like to beat Quack. I didn't mean it. Sometimes things happen that I don't remember, but Quack deserved it. All of the bullies deserved it. When I found Midnight, I became more than just myself. I leaned into what Midnight wanted me to be. Midnight was the first thing that ever wanted me for something. No one else did, so Quack got what they deserved.
At the flight school, they had the ultimate obstacle course. You could go against yourself and do trial after trial after trial, which I know some of the cadets did, but of course I never needed to. I wanted to. I wanted to be someone who was grinding, but of course I couldn't. Quack challenged me to a showdown. I didn't know what that means, and he laughed in my face with literal, “Ha, ha, ha”s coming off of his face. And I shrugged my shoulders, and they led me through.
The first was a speed test where you had to go as fast as possible and touch a button on one side and touch a button on the other side. The second was a giant ropes course designed for armors and I had to do - you had to do it as fast as you can. And the third and final one, they set - you set both mechs on either side of an enclosed chamber, like a tunnel and they just need to run into each other and whoever came out came out of that wall brawl.
The speed I handled with ease. I had gotten better at leaning into the thrusters that popped up when Midnight was ready to run, and I think he was - Quack was surprised. Quack thought he had it with the aerodynamics of the wings and all. That was his signature move. The spin and tuck and roll that only a duck is capable of [laughs]. I got too cocky.I thought that Midnight would take me through, but I guess Midnight wanted to teach me a lesson of my own and I literally fell each rope I needed to grab through in the second obstacle and I lost.
And finally was the Wall Brawl. They set us - it was really just a soccer field with walls on either side. It was literally a straight shot for each of the mechs to run into each other. Midnight wasn't big. He was fast and sleek and smart, but he wasn't big. The wingspan of Quack - I didn't think I could make it. A quarter of the way down I thought I couldn't make it and I said out loud, “Midnight, this isn't our time. We’re going to lose. You're going to die. I’m going to die. You’re going to die. Whatever you choose me for, we can’t do it together.” And then Midnight grew and grew and grew. I didn't even know there was enough - maybe the darkness was obscuring how much size there was, but it kept getting bigger so that we dwarfed Quack, we dwarfed the building, we dwarfed the soccer field. We were just too big.
And as they grew, they were talk- I felt more. I felt more than I had before. I felt bigger. And of course, when you feel big enough, it’s just you telling yourself that the other person deserves to be destroyed. Of course that's when I saw it for the first time. It wasn't an asteroid falling from the sky. It was something else. It seemed like just a falling rock, but as it got closer, it had arms, and hands, and feet, and it looked just like us. But it was green and purple and nothing falling from the sky should be like that, not from an asteroid. And it was heading right for us.
So we had to do what we had to do. We destroyed both. At the impact of Midnight with Quack and with the falling robot - what did we call- I forgot what we ended up calling them. It was like Snakes from the Sky. We ended up- they were all snakes to me, even with the arms and legs. I destroyed the snake and I destroyed Quack. I don't remember, but no one pushed me around after that.
Eric: Alright, that was 7. [laughs] I also like the thing at the end, Sunset said- writes at the bottom of the journal, “I won by the way. If that wasn’t clear. I was the winner. I won the whole thing.”
[rolls die]
Damn I got another 6. This is like- they're just running through this. I guess it’s what happens. I like to think that these are released in very short seasons, even though I know it’s an anime. But maybe it's in batches of six, one through six is one season, seven through twelve is one season, now we’re on thirteen. I also like that this is one season later, so this is FS52 Sol. and thirteen… let’s see what happens.
[rolls die]
6. I came back from the dead, that’s great.
[rolls die]
And 2. Again, it was temporarily transformed again.
[laughs] Oh my god. Okay. Let’s see, this one is called, “Did ya miss me?” Okay, alright, 13… What is a group of snakes called? I’m gonna look that up. A roomba? Oh a rhumba, like the dance. Brandon - [laughs] Brandon thought it was a Roomba of snakes that they go around and clean things for you as they go around on the ground. I like the rhumba is a group of snakes, so I think this is the destruction … okay. No kids - This is only like a few months later. This is all in seasons. So this is FS52 Sol- this is the hot season, in the hot season.
Eric [in game]: The funeral was nice. It was tasteful. I don't even know if you're supposed to know what tasteful means when you're this young, but no one’s supposed to see their own funeral. The Armor Institute put it for me. And I think they did it because they knew they sent a kid up too quickly, no matter how fast, and smart, and powerful, and cool, and strong, and kind, and sweet, and nice, and kickass he was. But no kid should be up there. Not against the rhumbas. Not against the rhumba of rattlesnakes that fell from the sky that day.
What happens when an asteroid comes through the orbit? Most if it’s supposed to burn off I guess and then it collides, but when you throw something living through the orbit, do you think they can wiggle through? Are there cracks that would keep you from falling at such a height and maybe you just end up down here. There’s a rope ladder in the sky, maybe.
When they found me, Midnight was surrounding me like a coffin. It’s as if the armor knew more than they did. I was happy to be there. But it was more confusing than anything else. It felt more like a bed than anything - it felt like a bed. Like a really nice dark bed if you went to a hotel and the blinds are pulled. I was alive in there, it’s just the coff- the armor thought it knew better. It wanted to say something to everyone else. So they let me - they let me bury it.
Luckily, we didn't believe in a - we didn't believe in an open casket, and honestly no one should after dying. I knew- maybe you get some peace. Maybe the dead sleep. I wasn't - I didn't want to sleep I wanted to go, but the armor knew better. Midnight knew better than that, so they left snacks in there the last time I wasn't looking, and even a screen to watch my favorite shows. Eventually armor- eventually, it opened.
Do you know how I knew it was tasteful? I saw it. It was nice, flowers everywhere. Enough crying, like not too much crying but enough crying. Someone was reading a poem that rhymed Sunset with “inset.” I hadn't met them before, but they said they were my friends. I guess - I guess that was Midnight’s plan, bringing all the people who didn't know me before together so I could really get a chance to tell them what for. And I did. Someone posted the video a little while later. It got more views - almost as much as the video of me blowing up the - an asteroid the size of ten shopping malls. Well I guess Midnight did that. I did this one. I don't know Sally. She shouldn't say that she did.
Eric: Freakin’ Sally showing up to my funeral and saying that she knew me. I bet she also pushed me into lockers before. Not old Sunset!
[rolls die]
Alright, that’s a 4. So we’re going to go to Episode 17. It’s funny these are all - I feel like the episodes I’ve been describing are like season openers and season closers, like they’re reestablishing something or like ending a story arc, so this is the first one where it feels like it’s gonna be in the middle of something that’s already happening. So this is 17. This is going to be AFS53 - I like that maybe now the seasons have changed now that we’re like more than - we’re 17, we're nearing the end of the season. Or nearing the end of the series. So maybe it’s like there are different ways of talking about this. So I’m going to think of some - so maybe it’s more basic, it’s just Drip, Dust, and… what’s another word for the sun that also has D, like… and Dry. So we were in Monsoon before so now we’re in Drip. So this is AFS53 Drip, Episode 17. Okay. Let’s roll them bones.
[rolls die]
Oh see, oh 5 is “Use the power of love,” very good, that’s for the protagonist, and-
[rolls die]
5. “Learned a new ultimate ability.” I love it. I wonder if this is like he gets disillusioned from the army and now he’s just a space cowboy. Like they totally turn the whole thing into how he does heists and he’s like the spec- he’s like the wild card. He’s like a space cowboy and he gets picked up with a bunch of other armors, and this is in the mid- this must be in the middle of the heist. So it’s called, I think this is “The Heist Part 3: Returns.”
Eric [in game]: I still think back- I think-
Eric: Maybe there’s space pirates, they call themselves space pirates but they're just robbers. They're just like -
Eric [in game]: I remember my time with the space pirates. With Goober and Jiminy and Rose and Tiko and Alphons. And there were two Roses, I guess there was Rose P and Rose F. They didn't name themselves after their armor. I had to remember that Sunset wasn't my - that I was Sunset and not Midnight. It was important to me. I had to be both.
This is when the heist went wrong. We had everything planned out. We knew that the - we knew that the guards were going to be out around their lunchtime. They were still using humans inside of there. Everyone else had used robotics, but that’s why we were going to hit the oldest bank on this side of the solar system. The people on Mars, they're proud people. Too proud if you ask me.
Alphons and I, we were supposed to watch out if something went bad, and something did. One of the guards found - one of the guards tripped while [laughs] getting outside of their armor. And that’s when the fire started. It was like a red dust storm, all of the armors blending into the red dust outside. I tried to fight them off as best as I could but it was overwhelming. It overwhelmed Alphons as well. There was one, two, three, five, ten, twenty mechs surrounding, each color of red dust, and I’d be turned into red dust if I couldn't help him.
I bare- I’d died once before and I knew I could die again. I screamed into the radio interface, “Alphons, just duck!” and I reached out, and I knew that if I did this for Alphons, I could get him out. I couldn't die. Or I knew how to the first time, at least I would make it pretty. At that point, Midnight knew what they had to do, and they grew arms. I knew Midnight always wanted to be a cat, but I more assumed he wanted to be a spider. He grew, he went from four to six to eight arms, each with its own eight arms of rockets fired at each one of the mechs.
The rockets spiraled out like, well, fireworks. It was beautiful. It was blue, and purple, and green on red. And it all, every single one, exploded in its own fireworks of its own. I grabbed Alphons by the- by his boot and pulled him back to safety. He popped out, and he was fine. Just like I was. Huh. I guess I can't die. Maybe they cant? There was too much- there were too many simoleons on the line for me to worry about that now. There was gold in them hills and we were ready to take ‘em.
Eric: Let’s roll again.
[rolls die]
3! AFS - so this is 3, there was an episode, so this would be AFS Dust Episode 20. So this is after the heist. You know, this is gonna be the hot springs episode [laughs]. I think this is the episode - this is like there’s an extended season, and this is between all the six that usually drop. And I think in this hot springs episode, they’re finally- the whole heist crew is cooling off after figure- after all of that. And they came out rich people, but of course, both of the Roses exploded on impact as they got the - tried to get the simoleons out, and I guess the asteroid came- one of the asteroids from the snakes exploded and took both of the Roses on. Let’s see what happens.
[rolls die]
2. I’m transformed- [laughs] The protagonist is transformed into a new powerful form.
[rolls die]
3. Oh took over control of itself. That’s wonderful. I think in the… Episode 20.
Eric [in game]: We all needed a break. We all did. Even I- I was different. I guess what I thought was oil on my hands was just - it was still there, it was black. Maybe Midnight was rubbing off on me. Rose P. had mentioned something about a hot springs on the other side of Saturn. It was the best one in town. And when she meant town she meant planets around, so I thought I’d stop in. We all stopped in, we deserved it.
I washed my hands so many times and nothing came off. Eventually, I just laze around, talked about Alphons, played with his new robotic eye as he popped it out and it swam around in the water like a duck- of course I didn't remember anything after that. Why would ducks mean anything to me? Don’t talk to me like that, I know. How did I end up on the other side of this? I wondered, after all the- I had seen so many explosions around me. I saw them in my dreams now. They're beautiful, they're stars. Stars in the sky that fall down to where we are, and it’s nice.
I guess I looked down at myself for the first time. It was nice being in the hot springs, getting my clothes off. The oil- I was still calling it oil- had spread. It was on my knees now, and my feet, and one of my ears, but at least I could hide that behind my hair. The hot springs was nice. I remembered that. I still think of a bath when - I still take a bath whenever I need to stop stressing out. Of course, that was the most time I had spent without Midnight in some time, so when I went back and pushed the ball and saw the biggest - a ruby the size of two of my heads staring back at me, I knew I shouldn't leave them for long without me.
[rolls die]
Eric: 3! Alright, I’m on Episode 23. [laughs] So this is the one before the finale. Alright, so that was Episode 20, so now we’re on Episode 23 that is AFS53 and now we’re on Dust.
[rolls die]
I keep getting 2s, so I’m re-rolling.
[rolls die]
6. Alright, I’ll come back to the - I’ll come back to the dead again. That’s fine. And-
[rolls die]
3. The armor took control of itself again.
Eric [in game]: Midnight always had better goals for me than I thought I did. But maybe it wasn't me. Maybe Midnight wasn't an armor at all, it was something else. It was a suit. It was a pair of shoes. It was a hat. It was a lie. It was a device. It was homework. It was… well that one doesn't fit. Those are all the clothes that I wore. This is my journal, I’m going to write it the way that I want. Don’t criticize me, me.
After the snakes led their full launch on Neo-America, I fought as best as I could. I shot all the shots. I punched all the punch. They had mechs of their own now. Rattles, vipers, poisons and such. I fought off as best as I could the explosions, you know. But eventually you can't do it anymore. If you and the armor are one, maybe the armor would do better without you. If taking the part out of yourself that doesn't know what it’s doing - that could be better, right?
So I hopped out and I ran. I ran home. I knew I - and I made it home before my mom did. It had only been a little while since I last saw her since they sent me off to the Academy. She wasn't expecting me, of course. She didn't lay a plate for dinner, but I knew she wanted to see the sunset. That’s me. I’m the Sunset. Of course she forgot the milk again. Of course that was the only reason she went out to the grocery store in the first place. So I went- I volunteered. I thought it would be a nice thing for me to do. Of course, I realized I’d left my wallet inside with a pack full of simoleons that only I knew what to do with. When I turned around, it was gone.
I forgot what a blast- what a blast feels like outside of the armor. How fast it is, how much it explodes. How fast it is, how quiet it is. We’re living in the future now, it doesn’t need to ex- if it doesn't collide with another mech, of course it doesn't explode. So it was just gone. The Academy thought I had died. Especially when Midnight was spread into the sky by the final launch of the snakes using their super weapon. It- everything is just a giant laser when you think of it, but this was a particularly giant laser. Midnight spread to - Midnight spread into the night sky, and I was a nobody again. I wasn’t Sunset. I was nothing. And I’m happy for it.
Eric: Alright, so now this is the finale. This is Episode 24. The format changes slightly. Instead of chronicling the past, you also include the present situation your protagonist is in - the situation that will, unknown to them, be their last. Once you’ve completed the episode, the game is over.
Eric [in game]: Now my life’s not interesting. I’m the guy. I’m Steve. Steve Park. Everyone’s named Park now in Neo-America. I work in the last remaining bookstore in the city, and I have pride in that. That doesn't make me special or anything. Maybe I wasn't. Maybe I never was. The fact that I could resist dying so many times. That’s not a special skill. That’s a circumstance. And I’m bored. I’m bored at work. No one’s come in for a few hours. Why do you need books when there's a tyrannical-mecha-space-snake autocracy running everything? They have you in the venom minds, or watching their eggs, or pulling the snake off- pulling their snake skins off, which honestly isn't that different than… what nail salons used to do in the past.
Eventually, the door is knocked on, the one at the front. It’s pushed open and the bell rings. I look up and I say, “Hello? Is anybody there? I’m Steve, I can help you out.” I don’t see anybody. There's a rustling in the fiction section near the mystery novels. It’s almost like a bouncing, like something is just - is bouncing along. It’s not steps. I don't think anything of it. Weirder people have come in. I guess they're not even people now. They're half-snake, half-alien, half-mecha things. Oh well. Can’t save ‘em all.
The bell in the front desk rings. I look up. There’s nobody there. I say, “Hello? Is anyone there? Do you want a book?” I look down. There’s a book in front of me. It’s an old detective novel I love to read. It was called, “The Sunset in the Midnight.” That’s silly. Those are the two names I recognize. And I look down at the silent, dark, ball sitting in the middle of the carpet. And it fades to black.
Eric: Woo! That’s my anime. It’s super dark and it only ran for 24 seasons. And I’m sure people really like it on Netflix. Uh, well that was the first time I had done anything like that. I’m sorry if it was sad and there were explosions, but I feel like that’s what anime is about? I don't know.
Sunset Park is a great name. I think I’m gonna have to use that. Or Midnight Park, I also like that as a name. This is the first - yeah, this is the first time I’ve done anything like this before, so we’ll probably keep doing one-shots in the future, but everyone please pick up Plot Armor by DC. You can just get that at itch.io and search “plot armor.”
It’s weird talking to yourself- just - I know Brandon was listening, but it was weird talking to myself. And I don't even know how long that went for. It might - Brandon says four hours, so it might be four hours. Honestly, if you told me that’s enough. Well we’re gonna come back with more Join the Party stuff and I’m gonna make jokes with other people in the future. And I hope you had a good time. Uh, you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here because I’m tired of talking. Buh-bye!"

Transcript
Eric: Alright, everybody, and welcome to…DDR - Dungeons and Dragons in Reality! And that's when you guys cheer.
[audience cheers]
This is DDR, it is the second best game with those initials.
[Julia chuckles]
So here is the deal, we are going to try something totally new when it comes to Dungeons and Dragons live. So, just come with us on this journey. Think of this kind of like an escape room. But instead of you and your coworkers arguing which key slot this gold painted prop is supposed to shove into, and then you yell at Debra in HR…uh, this is a podcast live show governed by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons.
Hello, I am Eric and I'll be your Dungeon Master this evening. A Dungeon Master means that you construct a story framework and I say some plot points and my players are going to experience it. And I'm going to lay out some chunks of exposition, control all the minor characters and just keep everything running smoothly.
Also, because this a live show, next to me, I have my good friend Brandon. And Brandon is going to do some Foley for me because he wanted to be involved.
[quiet, pitchy whistle, followed by laughing from audience]
Can you tweet that a little louder?
[more piercing, assertive whistle]
Good. Great. Thank you, Brandon.
Amanda: Brandon, you are going to be mixing this later. So, good luck to yourself.
Brandon: I'm not whistling into the microphone on purpose, Amanda.
Amanda: That’s true.
Eric: Alright. And now we're going to introduce our players. Now, ordinarily, players would be some sort of fantasy archetype, maybe a fighter, or a barbarian, or a wizard, or a cleric. But instead, our players are going to be playing themselves. Their species is human and their class is podcaster, which has NO skills!
[audience laughs with Eric joining in]
Julia: Like any good podcast.
Eric: Like any good podcaster, you have absolutely no skills. But they all have different backgrounds and an item to aid them in their adventure. So we're going to start with Amanda. So, Amanda, please introduce your character.
Amanda: Hello, my character's name is Amanda McLoughlin, it’s really a stretch. Um, so my background is business lady, which means that my languages that I know are negotiation and finance bro.
Um, I have organizational skills. So I can, like, look out at something and kind of like see it as if you imagine, like mind-mapping it on a board, meaning that I have just advantage and sort of investigation when I'm trying to assess. Like…imagine you walk in someone else's office, you're like, what's the important spreadsheet? Oh! I know it.
And then finally I have an item. So my item is called the introvert’s survival kit. And it is like, you reach into your backpack and, “Oh, wait!I have a band aid! I have a penknife! I have a flashlight! I have earplugs!”, which I do at all times. And the way that actually physically works is I have to roll a d20. If I get 11 or above, I get to tell the Dungeon Master what the item is that I bring out. If I get to 10 or below, he tells me what item I bring out like a frog or something not useful. Um, and…
Eric: I will tell you now, every time it's going to be a squished banana,
Amanda: [mildly disgusted] Ugh. And the only constraint I can bring up is that it has to fit in the backpack, and also be able to go through airport security. So, no liquids over 3 ounces for me.
Mike: No 5 ounces of peanut butter for you!
Amanda: No! Peanut butter is a gel! I have been told!
Mike: I hate it..
Julia: Um, I am Julia Schifini. My background is aspiring wrestler. Which means that I have fists and also can do wrestling moves.
My languages are Long Island and encrypted. And my efficiencies are in gin and ghosts.
[audience chuckles]
Amanda: I'm pretty sure that's our new podcast.
Julia: Yes, it is, Isn't that already our podcast?
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: My cool magic item is my cool hat. Which I brought with me, because why not? And if I turn it on backwards, I look like a totally new person. Which means opponents need to make a DC 13 Perception check in order to not to be charmed by me.
Eric: Like who is that scare team? I don't know who that is!
[Amanda acts flustered]
[enthusiastically] Wait, where’s Julia?! There's a 14 year old boy named Travis.
Julia: Oh damn!
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: [quietly] That’s me!
Eric Snider: I'm Eric Snider. And I thought this was Dance Dance Revolution. [sadly] So I don’t have any dice or character sheets, so I'm going to go sit down.
Eric: Great.
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric Snider: Okay.
Eric: Snider, buddy, did you not see anything that I said along about like, Dungeons and Dragons?
Eric Snider: You…you kept saying butterfly and…
Eric: No, that's exactly the opposite. That's not what I said at all.
Eric Snider: Yeah. Alright, I goofed bad.
Eric: Alright, well, after the show, you can go to Eric and talk to him about how good he was at Dance Dance Revolution in high school.
[audience laughs]
So thank you Eric Snider.
Julia: Eliminated.
[audience claps]
Mike: Hello! My name is Mike Schubert. My background for this game is amateur rapper. Because I was in an improvised hip hop group for 2+ years.
Eric: [chuckling] That explanation doesn't make it better.
Mike: [stumbling over words] The videos on YouTube are VERY good. So, the Englishs that I speak…I mean the languages that I speak are English and hype man. I am proficient in cooking and hair product.
And I have the ability of battle rap, so I can cast vicious mockery at will if I do a rap and depending on how good it is, which will be very good, I will roll the specific die, which I assume will be the best die, to say how much psychic damage that I do. I also have a New York Knicks basketball, which I did not bring with me unfortunately, but I can compel someone to play hoops with me. And I get +5 to persuasion if I do. Also it's a basketball! So I can use it as such.
Eric: [chuckles] Use it for basketball reasons?
Mike: Mhm.
Eric: Okay, so now we have introduced our players. Is everybody ready?
Julia: Yeah.
Mike: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah, let’s do it.
Eric: Okay, cool. I'm so excited.
The three of you wake up with the smell of chlorine in your nostrils. Then funnel cake. And sunscreen? And you just like keep hearing this whistle?
[pitchy, light whistle sound, audience reacting to it]
The three of you look around and you were [brief pause to laugh]…the three of you look around and you are sitting in a minivan. Where are you sitting in the minivan?
Julia: Backseat, all the way in the back. Lounged, completely.
Amanda: Uh, trunk lying diagonally…on the floor.
Julia: Why?!
Mike: I’m in…it's a 2015 Chrysler Town and Country, so it has the captain's chairs that rotate to the back.
Amanda: Oh yeah.
Mike: And it's facing backwards!
Amanda: WOW! Bold choice!
Eric: [laughs] So Mike, your captain's chair swivels to the front, and you see that the front console turns on. And a cassette tape that was sitting in the mouth of the cassette player pops in and goes…
[Eric makes winding up sound]
And starts to play.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Good Morning Dungeoneers!
Eric: You hear over the little loudspeakers.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): I see that you've just woken up. Wonderful! It is so much better to have active players than just bodies strewed upon the ground.
[long pause]
Amanda: Yeah!
Mike: I'm sorry, what?
Amanda: What?!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): First, let me introduce myself. I am the Dungeon Master. You're in my dungeon, so to speak, and you will play by my rules…
Mike: Your dungeon’s a van?
Julia: All minivans are dungeons.
Mike: Mhm.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): The second thing is that this is a cassette tape and you can't talk back to it.
Julia: [chuckles] We can, you just can't us!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): I can't hear you. I'm having the time of my life.
Mike: Hey, it's like listening to a podcast, guys.
Amanda: We’re all friends when it’s podcasts.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Smash that subscribe!
[audience laughing]
[barely audible whistle in background]
Eric: Brandon, [laughing] Brandon did a foul.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): I have put many through many trials and you may be the best competitors yet! I knew that podcasters would be perfect for a grueling challenge of Strength, Wit, and Constitution.
[Julia chuckles]
But, please! Let me tell you what the rules. You will have 15 minutes to complete by puzzums and walk through the blue door at the end. Now, these aren't traditional puzzums per se….
Mike: Did you say, puzzums?
Amanda: I say through the trunk, what's happening?!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): More like wet and wild water adventures.
Julia: Oh no.
Amanda: Oh noooo.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Check your pockets.
Julia: I checked my pocket.
Eric: You guys look down and you're wearing old timey bathing suits? Like from the 1950s.
[Julia groans]
Amanda: Oh nooo.
Eric: So all of you are wearing, it looks like you're in a Hollywoodland and you're like a prisoner? But in like, old timey bathing suits.
Julia: Does mine have sleeves?
Eric: Yes.
Julia: Oh, unfortunate. I'm gonna try and cut them off later.
Eric: Okay, great! But they all have pockets. And does anyone want to reach in their pocket?
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: You all reach into your pockets and you pull out a punch card that says Splish Splash Sea Bash Triple Play!
Julia: [whispers] Oh no, not splish splash.
Eric: [enthusiastically] Where the rides…ARE THE REAL FUN! So is the friendship!
[audience laughs]
Amanda: Is the card narrating itself to us?
Eric: No, that's what’s on the card.
Amanda: Okay, okay.
Mike: You can tell it’s by the font.
Amanda: Yes, you can tell it from the font in your brain.
[Eric giggling]
Amanda: I'm sorry…can you tell us what the font chiller sounds like?
Eric: [deeper, more enunciated] Splish splash sea bash triple play.
Julia: That’s somehow worse!
Amanda: How about how about webdings?
Eric: Smiley face, goat, butt, thumbs up.
Julia: We have a timer on, let's go!
Eric: There's punch card and there are three suns with sunglasses on. And that's like the kind of indicate that's where you have to put the punch cards.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Complete my puzzums three and be free! Now, I wouldn't be a Dungeon Master without giving you a hint! Don't worry, there is a cracked iPhone 5 somewhere nearby.
Eric: And Julia, underneath you, you feel a buzz.
Julia: I reach underneath me and into the seat…
Eric: And it's a cracked iPhone 5.
Amanda: Great.
Eric: And there's a text on it, from…there's a WhatsApp from a guy named Steven.
Julia: [skeptically] I don’t like it. I read it though.
Eric: [chuckles] Uh, okay. We'll get back to that in a second. But the cassette finishes up…
Eric (as Dungeon Master): If you run out of time, well, we'll get to it when you get to it. Hope you have a splish splash day. Bye-bye. The timer starts…now.
Eric: You guys all hear a faint ticking but you don't know where it's from.
Amanda: Oh no…
Julia: Is it from the broken iPhone 5?
Eric: [laughs] Yeah, it’s from the broken iPhone 5, that has a timer on it. It's starting slowly, counting down. Now it's at 49:47. Julia, Do you want to check the WhatsApp?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Okay. It's from Steven and it says, Yo, DM, want to get tacos?
Julia: DM?
Eric: Yeah. Julia, I want you also to look…this has 10% battery on it.
Amanda: [yells] Ahh! The true horror!
Eric: And it's cracked down the front.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So, let me tell you about this item. You can try to do anything that you would want to do with…that you can get an iPhone 6. Unfortunately, it has Boost Mobile. So the service is not great. And also, you're going to see where you are, so the service might not be that great. But also you only have 10% battery. So like imagine you can only do one thing with it.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: Do we want to open up Google Maps on the broken iPhone and look for taco places near us?
Amanda: Uh, why don't we see if there's a map of the park outside first? Try to analog and if we need digital, let's do that.
Julia: Okay. Got you.
Mike: Slide it into airplane mode to save battery.
Amanda: Yes!
Julia: [yells] YESSSS!! Smart! Can we turn it off for now and then turn it back on?
Amanda: No!!! That costs more battery!
Julia: Oh no, that costs more battery, I’m so sorry!
Mike: We’re on airplane…
Amanda: Okay, so why don't we get out of the minivan and look around?
Julia: Oh wait. I close out the WhatsApp so it doesn’t drain more battery.
[everyone makes rushed agreements]
Amanda: Yes, excellent.
Eric: Okay, wonderful. So you guys get out of the minivan and there are no other cars in sight.
Amanda: Is it a parking lot?
Eric: It is a parking lot, yes. It is totally abandoned, but in the near distance you hear that there is a lot of cheering and you see that there are a lot of people a few clicks that way. I know that means kilometers but like, come on, cut me some slack.
Amanda: So…let's walk towards them…
Mike: Yes.
Amanda: Are we outside of an amusement park? Outside of the Splish Splash?
Eric: Yes. So you are…you see a giant line. And in the far distance, you see the neon archway of Splash Splash Sea Bash, and is jam-packed with people. But for some reason, this line is not moving. And like people are complaining to each other. And they're like on their phones. And just kind of like, messing around. But yeah, the line is just not moving.
Amanda: [strained] Does anybody have a battery pack!?
Julia: Please, someone!
Mike: Let's walk towards the Splish Splash?
Amanda: Yeah, talk our way in. Let's do it.
Eric: Okay, cool. So you’re just going to go past the line?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Alright. About halfway through the line, people have been giving you dirty looks as you were walking by them. And then you see, a step in front of you, is just like 50-year old mother with like two sun hats on top of each other. And…she with some sunscreen on her nose, and she says...
Eric (as Mom in Line): [snarky] Hey, we've been waiting here all day! You go back to the back of the line!
Amanda: I would like to reach into my introvert’s survival kit for a Splash Splash VIP card.
Eric: Okay. Roll a d20 and see if you find that in there.
[die rolls]
Amanda: I got 14, babyyy!
Eric: Alright. So with the 14 you pull out this Splish Splash VIP card. What does it look like?
Amanda: It is a little bit damp.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Is it laminated?
Eric: It becomes damp.
Amanda: Yes, it is laminated, but there's water under the lamination.
[Eric laughs]
And It's just printed with little waves and then it says Splish Splash, and then on the back, VIP. It looks so janky and that's how you know it's real.
Eric: You see there's like a fold in the lamination where someone messed up.
Amanda: Yes, that's correct.
Eric: Okay, cool. So what do you do now?
Amanda: I'm going to show it to the lady. Flip it around so she sees the VIP on the back, and continue walking toward the tickettaker.
Eric (as Mom in Line): [impatiently] Um, excuse me that seems like it's fake. I don't know what you're talking about. And you don't have to go to the back of the line. My son Jimothy has been waiting here for a year!
Julia: A whole year?
Eric (as Mom in Line): A whole year!
Julia: That's…he hasn't been in school?
Eric (as Mom in Line): Don't talk to me about my educational preferences!!!
Julia: Do you…parking lot school?
Eric (as Mom in Line): [increasingly impatient] What did I just say about preferences!?! Excuse me, go to the back of the line! Can I see your VIP badge!?! Can I see it? I want to see it with my hands, I see best when I touch it, when I touch things…
Amanda: I'm gonna walk away…
Eric: You’re going to walk away?
Amanda: Yeah…
Julia: Just continue past.
Eric (as Mom in Line): Yeah…I'm gonna get security.
Mike: [confidently] Try us!
Amanda: Yeah…
Eric: You just going to walk away?
Amanda: Yes. Well I mean, okay, so I know negotiation. Alright, let's say, um…
Listen, if you let us go unencumbered, as we should as our right as VIP card holders…we will let you share our benefit of the exclusive VIP locker room. Once you make it into the park, meet us outside the real… the peons locker room, and we will show you…
Eric: That’s what they call it, yes.
Amanda: Where there are always towels, they smell of eucalyptus. There is free water bottles. Unlike the water that’s all in the park.
Julia: Your sneakers don't end up damp for some reason.
Amanda: Yes! And there's even…charcuterie!
Eric: Alright, you're gonna have to make a Deception check but I'll give you advantage because you know negotiation. And like that was pretty buck wild.
[audience laughs]
Amanda: Uh, only got a 6 + 2 for an 8…
Eric: You have advantage. You have advantage.
Amanda: Oh! Hot diggity. Well…that one was a critical 1, so. Let's say…let's say 8.
Eric: Okay, I think with an 8, honestly, this woman did not take much…[laughs] you know what? I have the number 6 in my head. So she says,
Eric (as Mom in Line): I always wanted some of that water park charcuterie. Alright, well find me. Here, what do you…do you have a phone? Can you put me in your phone?
Amanda: Yeah, just tell me the number and I'll write it down. And I'll mime writing into the iPhone 5 while NOT activating its lock screen!!
Eric (as Mom in Line): Alright, so it's Bethany with two B's.
Julia: Mhm.
Mike: Where's the second B?
Brandon:Thank you Mike.
Julia: Sounds like Long Island, go ahead.
Eric (as Mom in Line): Uh...in the front?
Amanda: [trying to contain laughter] Okay.
Eric: And then you just hear a lot of static.
Julia: It's like a BB flat.
[staticky radio sound]
Amanda: Yeah, yeah. What like what if it's like the B in German with like the long tail, but instead it's just two Bs on top of each other?
Julia: I like that. Wonderful.
Mike: Wait, we hear a lot of static?
Eric (as Mom in Line): Well alright, my number is…
Eric: And then just, like a lot of static.
[louder static]
Amanda: It’s good because I don’t care.
Mike: Okay, is she a simulation?
Eric: Who can say?
Amanda: Maintain eye contact, move slowly, and continue walking.
Eric: Okay, great. So you guys get to the front of the line. And the reason why it's moving is that no one is working at the front!
Julia: Uh oh!
Mike: We sneak in.
Eric: [laughs] No one is working at the front!
Julia: I'm just gonna…
Mike: No ones working at the front…
Eric: So Mike just walks in!
Mike: No ones there…
Eric: Mike, you want to just walk in?
Mike: No, no, no. Is there nothing blocking?
[incoherent deliberating between the podcasters]
Eric: Absolutely not.
Mike: Can I roll my basketball to see if any, like, traps are activated?
Eric: Um, a seven year old runs up to the basketball and like, tries to pick it up.
Mike: Does he pick it up?
Eric: Yeah, he picks it up.
Julia: Your basketball is not like, mutinize.
Mike: I don't know, he said tries to pick it up! I say Hi, can I have my basketball back, sir?
Eric: He's like, okay…and then he throws the basketball and then he runs away.
Mike: Cool. I start to walk into the park.
Eric: Okay, Mike walks into the park and nothing happens.
Amanda: Alright, we follow Mike into the park. I’m going to mime swiping my VIP card to make it appear as if I have the right to be doing this. And then continuing.
Julia: Is there a barcode on the VIP card?
Amanda: Um, there are so many wrinkles, it looks like a barcode.
Julia: Gotcha, that makes sense.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Okay…so you guys are now inside of Splash Splash Sea Bash.
[Slow repeating of Splishhh, Splashhh, Splishhh, Splashhh]
Julia: Is that the theme music, just splish splash?
Brandon:That’s the water Foleys.
Julia: Aw, okay. Thank you.
Amanda: Oh…
[cacaw of a bird]
Julia: Beautiful…
[cashew cashewww birdsong]
Amanda: Are there ravens here?!
Eric: Yeah, there's a raven perched on top of a fake mountain. It’s in the background.
Amanda: Quote the Raven: Wait 20 minutes after eating before you go back on the rides! Jesus.
Eric: Okay, and it is jam packed with people. There are kids running around everywhere and their parents are trying to keep up behind. Teens are doing nefarious things as teens do. And someone is just like walking around with a giant turkey leg.
Julia: Tight, I want the turkey leg.
Eric: Okay, so you guys look around and you see that there are three main roads you can take. There are the 420 slides.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: There's the lazy river, TM TM TM, the first one. And then there is a wave pool which is just like chill waters.
Julia: Is there a map of the park?
Eric: I mean, that's the park.
Julia: No, but…could I find a place where perhaps a taco place could be found?
Amanda: A directory of services.
Eric: Sure. Okay. Yeah, there's a…right next to the way that these three roads split off, there is a giant directory. So, you see that this is kind of like sketched out a little more. The 420 slides like…
Amanda: [interjecting] Blaze…
Eric: It's very cartoonish. So the 420 slides…
Amanda: [interjecting again] Blaze…
Eric: [chuckles] are very, look crazy tall. And the stairs that go up and up and up. The lazy river TM TM TM TM, goes all the way around the park. And the chill water. What did I call it?
Amanda: The wave pool?
Eric: The chill water, the Chill Waters, it’s actually in order to get to it, you have to pass by this like water playground? You know what I’m talking about?
Amanda: Yeah!
Mike: Yeah…
Julia: For the small kids.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: We know.
Eric: So that's, that's what you see on the map.
Mike: Okay. What are we doing?
Amanda: Finding the tacos?
Julia: That's my instinct is to find the tacos.
Mike: Okay, alright.
Amanda: Are there restaurants listed on the directory?
Eric: What tacos are you talking about?
Amanda: The ones for that guy!!!
Eric: [chuckles profusely] Oh that’s right, Steven!!
Mike: That’s all we have to go on, right?!
Eric: Yes!
Mike: Unless I missed something!
Eric: Oh, yeah. So there is also…yeah, there is a food court over to the left.
Mike: We go to the food court.
Amanda: Yes.
Okay, so in the food court there is like a Belgian waffle spot. And there's an ice cream place and there is also a taco spot. And it's called Hot Hot Heat.
Mike: Are there lines at the other food places?
Eric: No, there's nobody here.
Mike: No one is working at either?
Eric: Yeah, there'll be…nobody working, nobody working here either.
Julia: Can we just go into the back of it?
Mike: Yeah, sure.
Eric: If you want to.
Mike: We go into the back of the taco place.
Eric: Okay, so inside of the back of the of the taco place at Hot Hot Heat, it just looks like an abandoned kitchen. Like you would assume that they would have like utensils and knives and like food, but there's just like, nothing there.
Mike: Can I investigate to see like, what else is here?
Eric: Sure, make an Investigation roll.
Mike: Okay, I'm rolling. That's a 17.
Eric: Okay!
Amanda: Oh!!
Eric: With a 17, you see there is a walk in freezer that is open and you hear giggling?
Mike: I…okay. One of you hold the door open.
[high-pitched giggling]
Julia: Yes, I’ll hold the door open.
Mike: Julia holds the door and I walk in.
Eric: Okay. So you see that there is a like a grown man sitting in the walk-in closet, spinning a dreidel and just laughing at it.
Mike: I say Sup?
Eric: He’s like,
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Sup? This dradle is so fun, man. Sometimes it lands on something, and it's like, you get all of the coins? But sometimes it lands on a different thing and you get other than the coins.
Amanda: I perk up and say, odds, bruh, am I right?
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Yeah…super odds just in this dradle man.
Amanda: Probability man.
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Just like it's nice. It's good. It's good stuff.
Amanda: Listen, we're looking for the DM. Have you seen him anywhere?
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Oh, DM, man? Oh man, listen, I've been spending this dradle for like four hours now so like I haven't seen him.
I wanted him to come meet me here and get tacos but like you know, he's just he's busy doing stuff. You know he's probably at the like the Royal Cabana there at the end?
Julia: Where is that?
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Oh man you just you go over to the deep waters and then you take a right and it's like that really big cabana thing And there's a security person there who needs to like see your badge, with the stuff, with the triple play.
Amanda: Oh, which badge? Do you have one? Just so I can figure out which one it is?
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Oh yeah, I have it right here.
Eric: He takes out the same punch card that you guys have and all three of the sunglasses men faces are punched in. How do you get those punched brah?
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Oh, man, I just like rode all the rides dog! Oh, yeah!! I rolled a shin nice. I have to share some of my gold.
Julia: Sweet. We got to go on the rides y’all.
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: Hang on. Any chance you want to trade that one for a fresh one? Just a fresh opportunity to like go on the rides again?
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Uh, no? Uh no, I do not want to do that.
Amanda: Okay. I had to ask, I had to ask.
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Is that okay with you?
Amanda: Totally fine, totally fine. Enjoy.
ES (as Man with Dreidel): Oh nice. Okay, have fun.
Julia: Cool. Thanks. Also tell the DM to refill more tacos in here! Like I don't have any taco supplies.
Julia: Yeah, we’ll let him know.
Amanda: Okay, I'm sorry.
Mike: Appreciate it. Let's roll to the 420 slides.
Amanda: [short pause] Blaze.
Mike: Nice.
Eric: Ok. So the 4…outside the 420, you see that there's a description of the ride. And the ride says, Oh! Hey, bro! Welcome to the 420 slides where it takes 420 steps to get to the top!
Amanda: That’s a lot of steps.
Eric: Heee. Heheheheh.
[very quiet whistle note]
Heheheh. So just like come on up and like ride the ride, man?
Amanda: Why don't I do guard duty?
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: And someone stronger than me should do those steps.
Julia: So that'll be me.
Mike: Okay, I've been with you just in case.
Julia: Well, do we all have to do it in order to all get the punch card?
Eric: Yes, every single one of you have to go up.
Julia: Sorry, but I carry you if you need.
Amanda: Thank you, Should we just go up it?
Mike: I’ll slowly like, start singing The Eye of the Tiger.
[Eric and Mike chuckle]
Eric: Okay, you guys start walking up the slides and about 100 feet up, you see the next group of people together who are also walking up the slides. And it is a father with a 10 year old girl who is and he just has his head in his hands. And you see that the 10 year old girl is pulling on her dad's shirt and pointing at you, at you three as you walk up.
Julia: I say, sup?
Eric: As she turns, as the little girl turns to her dad and says,
Eric (as Girl): Hey, Dad, can I can I ask them the question?
Eric: And he says,
ES (as Man with Dreidel): No, No, don't do that. I really don't want you to do that.
Eric: And she says,
Eric (as Girl): Okay, well, I'm asking the question is anyway! Hey, new friends. Where do babies come from?
Mike: I look at the dad and make the eye contact of like, should I tell her?
[Eric and audience laugh]
Eric: He has his head in his hands and is avoiding eye contact.
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric: He's like, he’s just like,
ES (as Man with Dreidel): [stuttering] No, you don't have to…you don't have to…Don't do that.
Mike: How old is she?
Eric: She's 10.
Mike: 10.
Amanda: That’s really a quandary. It’s about your family and your parenting techniques…
Julia: Sixth grade I think is when they told us we officially…
Amanda: I mean, what are you gonna say? What words are you going to say?
Julia: Why are you looking at me? I speak Long Island and cryptic.
Amanda: How about I say? Well if you're super brave and go down the slide and don't yell even once, then I'll tell you at the bottom.
Eric (as Girl): Okay! Well I'm definitely gonna come find you regardless of what you go…I'm just gonna find you and I'm going to follow you around because I really need to know! No one will tell me what's going on here. And I think that is a big conspiracy and I don't think there are ANY birds involved!!
[audience laughs]
Julia: There aren't, you're correct.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric (as Girl): Cool.
Amanda: Knowledge
Eric (as Girl): Dad, I’m on the TRAIL.
Amanda: We give her a high five and continue walking.
Eric (as Girl): Okay. Where do I find you?
Amanda: We're going to be the entrance when the park closes. Also continuing your quest for knowledge. Power. Love you.
[Eric chuckles]
Amanda: You small child.
Eric: Amanda, the 10 year old looks at you in the eyes and I need you to make a Charisma saving throw.
[audience laughs]
Julia: Oh God, It wasn't me.
[die rolls]
Amanda: 12.
Eric: Okay. With a 12, you see that she makes very big eyes you and says,
Eric (as Girl): You promise you're going to tell me the secret of where babies come from? You promise…?
Amanda: [cautiously] Yes.
Eric (as Girl): Okay, well if you promise, I'm sure it won't cause anything later in my life.
[audience laughs jovially]
Amanda: I take out a napkin, write down my phone number, and give it to her.
[Eric and Amanda laugh]
Just in case we get separated.
Eric: [laughing] Your personal phone number? Okay cool, that’s fine.
Amanda: Yes.
Julia: With the terrible phone we have?
Amanda: No, my personal phone number. If indeed, my phone still exists, wherever my clothes went…
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: As a reminder, we're in old timey bathing suits.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: Can I do a Strength check to rip the sleeves off of my old timey bathing suit?
Eric: Sure, make a Strength check to rip off the [chuckles] sleeves…
Julia: It's a 7 + 3, so a 10.
Eric: Okay, with a 10…you only rip off one.
Amanda: It's a good look.
Mike: That’s what a 10 does.
Julia: I'm fine with that.
Eric: Yeah. Also Julia’s super strong, but she has low constitution because she can't drink brown liquor.
Julia: It’s true.
Eric: I thought that you’d like to know that.
Julia: It's very true.
Eric: I thought was pretty funny. Okay, so you guys walk up another like 100, 150 steps it's getting pretty steep now.
Amanda: Oh god.
Mike: I switched to singing The Final Countdown.
Julia: We're about halfway at this point!
Eric: It's like a low mist that has settled,settled down.
And there is a bro is waiting, looking over the side over to the left. He's wearing a waterproof Hawaiian shirt.
[Mike gasps]
Julia: I want to take it off of him.
Eric: And yeah, he's sitting there leaning over the side.
Mike: I say, sup brah.
Amanda: Sweet shirt.
Eric (as Bro): Thanks, thanks brah…uh bruv,
Eric: [stumbles for a second] Oh no! He's British, I made him British!
Julia: Oh no!
Amanda: Oh no!
Julia: You’ve made a terrible mistake!
Eric: No, he’s not British.
Amanda: [chanting] Commit to the bit! Commit to the bit!
Eric: Okay, no he’s British, great.
Eric (as Bro): [continues in British accent] Hey Bruv! Uh, yeah, I’m just waiting here, [slips into Brooklyn accent] eh oh…oh no!!!
Julia: Why is he from Brooklyn if he’s British?
Eric: [laughing jollily] Oh no!
Eric (as Bro): [continuing in accent] 420 slides, eh? In’it? My chap…friend is gonna come up as well.
Eric: Don’t look at me like that!
Julia: So it’s this moment right now.
Eric (as Bro): Uh, yeah, so you guys can't pass me because like my friend is supposed to come up here in a in’it.
[Eric exhales]
Mike: I say, please ma'am! We just want to go down the slide.
Eric (as Bro): I know, but I…I have to do, bollox! I gotta go without him!
[audience laughing]
Mike: Uh, okay…I cast battle rap.
Eric: Okay.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: I cast…battle rap.
Eric: Okay, Mike, do you want me to give you beat?
Mike: I need one.
Eric: This is gonna be terrible, okay.
[Eric beatboxes, with Brandon supporting]
Mike: [rapping] Alright, BRUV,
I see you trying to front me,
I want to go down the slides 420,
I just want to go down the slide
Cause this looks like a pretty sweet ride,
I want to go down
With all the water
Who's that?
Oh look it's your daughter!
[Eric laughs, breaking the beat]
Mike: [wrap ended] And then I try to sneak by.
Amanda: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[everyone laughing, short spurt of whistle from Brandon]
Eric: Alright Mike, roll a roll a d20.
Mike: Okay.
[die rolls]
That would be a 6.
Amanda: Does he get advantage for his performance?
Eric: Yeah, roll it again, roll it again.
Mike: Okay, Okay.
Amanda: C’mon!
Mike: That would be…an 8!
Amanda: Better!
[groans from Julia and Mike]
Mike: Do I get to add any bonuses of sorts?
Julia: Charisma?
Eric: Uh…
Amanda: Proficiency?
Eric: Yeah, you have…you have proficiency in battle rap. So that's like a 10?
Amanda: The top left number.
Eric: Nah, that’s fine. That’s a 10.
Mike: I have +5 for ya.
Amanda: Oh!
Eric: Oh, you have +5?
Mike: I have +3 for Charisma.
Eric: Okay. It's like a 12…13. Okay! So with the…with the battle rap you say? Wait a second! Eh, eh, bruv! I have a daughter? And then you guys are able to run by.
Julia: Cool.
Amanda: Yeah!
Mike: I scream, Her name is Monica!!
[everyone laughs]
Julia: Call your ex-girlfriend!
Eric: I have to think about the choices I’ve made in my life!
[audience chuckles]
Okay, you guys are now at the top of the for 420 slides and there is a..a lifeguard standing at the top and they hold their hand out and they're waiting to try to look down and see if people are coming down. And like you see now these slides are incredibly steep. Like they are so steep you can't even see the bottom.
Amanda: We see that NOW?
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Oh no..
Eric: Yeah, you…you cannot see the bottom of the pool. And I need everyone to make Charisma saving throws.
Julia: [mumbles] Oh, I’m not good at that.
[dice roll]
Mike: Oh! A 2 + 3 for a 5!
Julia: 10!
[Mike chuckles]
Amanda: 21, baby!
[podcasters cheer, whistle from Brandon]
Julia: Charismatic as hell!
Amanda: [whispers] That’s the secret to business. Pretend you know what you're doing, then people think you do!
Eric: Amanda you’re just like, Oh yeah! You just cross your arms your legs no problem, it's fine.
And Julia is like, Oh, I've never been on a slide this high.
And Mike you're like, OH NO!!! Why would I do this to myself?!?
[everyone laughing]
So Mike, you are currently frightened.
Mike: Cool.
Eric: You do not want to go down the slides. You can roll again in like 2 minutes to see if you can do it, but I think that you need to help your good good friend Mike go down the slides.
Julia: Can I just pick him up and just put him on slide? And push him down?
Eric: It's like the lifeguard holds out his hand to you and says, Please do not push grown men if they do not want to onto slides.
Mike: [tentatively] You guys go down first, it's fine. I'll be alright. Let me just talk it out with myself.
Julia: [chuckling] I think I'm still gonna do it, though.
[audience laughing]
Eric: [also laughing] Okay!
Julia: Because I learned this in class, which is my feat actually, it's called, ‘I learned this in class’ and if I make an Intelligence roll of DC 13 if I pass, I won't have to use a roll to do a wrestling move, I just do it myself.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: Okay, but you know that if you fail it, you get hurt…
Julia: No, I hurt myself in the process.
Eric: Oh, that's right, because safety first. That's right. Even in wrestling, safety first.
Julia: Safety is always important.
Eric: Okay, so you're going to try to push him down the slide using a wrestling move?
Julia: I'm going to pick him up over my shoulder and then flip him onto the slide.
[Eric cackles, everyone laughs]
Yep, yep, yep.
And do I add my Strength bonus to this?
Eric: No it’s just intelligence.
Julia: Right, sorry. Alright, so that is an 11 + my Intelligence which is the 3, so it's a 14!
[everyone cheers the passing roll]
Eric: Alright, so Julia what does it look like when you throw…when you fireman-carry Mike onto the slide?
Julia: So it’s a power slam, so you basically pick him up, you put them over your shoulders and then you flip him into the water and then he slides down.
Mike: And then I go, [going down the slide] how are you so strongggg!
[Eric cackles]
Julia: [going down the slide] Squatsss!
Eric: [going down the slide] Core strengthhhh! OK, so now you guys can go down the slide as well.
Amanda: Sweet, alright.
Eric: Alright, so you guys properly wait your turn. Mike, how do you feel, bud?
Mike: I imagine I went down upside down.
Eric: Oh 100%.
Mike: So, not great. But it's like when you go on like a really scary ride but you're trying to not act scared, like, [nonchalantly] Yeah. That was fine, that wasn’t that bad. It was chill.
Amanda: As his knees knock together audibly.
[Eric and Julia chuckle]
Eric: So at the bottom you guys get out of the wave pool. And you clear out of the way…
[break in audio for brief period of time]
It's all like off brand, like sea-level CW characters? So It's like people from One Tree Hill who you don't recognize
[audience chuckles]
Julia: Okay…
Mike: Like The Flash?
Amanda: Seventh Heaven?
Eric: Like people from The Flash who have like two pieces of fanfic written about them.
Amanda: How dare you!
Eric: [cackles] So you guys can pick a…you guys can pick a floaty from the side,
Julia: Like color, or shape or what are our options here?
Amanda: Or are they all theme parked.
Eric: They're all they're all themed, so you guys can just pick whatever one you want.
Mike: I take The Vampire Diaries floaty.
Eric: See, Mike is playing in the space. I like it.
[audience laughs]
Julia: Um, I want the girlfriend from Black Lightning?
Eric: Good, very good.
Amanda: Uh, I close my eyes and choose one at random.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: Because Amanda has not seen enough CW shows to know what to do.
Amanda: Uh, yes…and?
Eric: You stick your hands out and you pick one and it's Chad Michael Murray. But his last name is spelled wrong. It's MURAY.
Julia: Gotcha.
Amanda: Cool. Cool. Do I sit like where his abs are supposed to be like…is his face on it?
Eric: [laughing] Yeah, you sit where Chad Michael Murray’s abs should have been.
Amanda: Okay, alright.
Mike: Can I trade my Vampire Diaries out for a Jane the Virgin one that's just a tube that says ‘virgin’ on it?
Eric: [cackles] Yeah. That’s fine, that’s pretty good.
Mike: Tight, tight, tight.
[audience laughs]
Julia: You don’t want bisexual Tyler Posey?
Mike: I don't know. Those are the two CW shows I know.
Julia: He's from Jane the Virgin, it’s fine.
Eric: Yeah, there's also one that says but Rebecca Brunch on it, that you can get if you really want that.
Julia: Damn…
Eric: One person laughed at that. That's my target audience.
Eric and Julia: [together] Thank you!
Eric: Alright, so, you guys are on the lazy river and you guys look around and why don't you all make a Perception check?
[dice roll]
Amanda: A non-natural 20.
Julia: 11.
Mike: Uh, 8.
Eric: Okay. So, Amanda, you hear the low sound of whistling the same whistle that you've been hearing the entire time. There…
[long, drawn out whistle, audience laughing]
Amanda: It’s so close to my head.
Eric: [chuckles] And Amanda, you know at your extensive time of living on a beach on Long island…
Amanda: Yes, that is correct.
Eric: that you don't think there's a lifeguard on duty
Amanda: Do I discern at all where the whistle is coming from? Is it from like closer into the park? Is it for one of the three you spokes?
Eric: So you hear the music it is pretty nearby. So, I will say that you know they there whoever the lifeguard is probably on the lazy river. But you don't know where. The lazy river is divided into four different areas. There's like for some reason it has like an earthen Airbender theme? So It's like the first one is water. The second one is air. The third one is fire. And the fourth one is Earth
Mike: We go to the heart section.
[someone in the office laughs uncontrollably]
Eric: And they're like, this is net property!!
So you hear it and it's definitely not in the one that you're in.
Mike: Do we…do we know which one we are in?
Eric: You are currently in the first one which is…I'm going to write this down because I just made this up and I…
Julia: Air? I think you said air first.
Eric: It was air…was water fire air and earth. So the first one is not in water.
Amanda: I mean, the river flows in one direction, right? So, I think I think we just got to kind of keep going
Mike: Or do we want to attract the lifeguard? Should I pretend to drown?
Amanda: [interested] Oh!
Julia: Oh, well, I'm concerned about…actually let's do that.
Mike: I pretend to drown to try to draw the lifeguard closer to us.
Eric: Okay, Mike, I want you to make a Performance roll. So that’s Charisma.
Eric: Then use your Performance like to see if you if someone [laughs] believes you're drowning.
Mike: That is a 17 + 3 for a non-natural 20!
[everyone cheers, someone claps]
Julia: Play the victim!
[sounds of someone drowning]
Eric: Alright, so…Mike you hear a rapid…
[sounds of someone drowning]
Eric: You hear a rapid number of splashing and you see that there is a 7 foot tall,110 pounds wet lifeguard standing over you.
[sharp bursts of whistleblowing]
Julia: Is it Michael Phelps?
Mike: Sir! Oh, hey! Save me!
[Mike makes drowning sounds]
Julia: Sir, hey, blah, blah, blah. Cool.
Eric: He is standing in the water and although it looks even lower because he's 7 feet tall, it is literally like 2 feet deep.
Mike: I stand up and then, “Oh, sorry! Oh…anyway, could you please punch my punch card sir? And the punch cards of my friends? [unconvincingly] We've been on all four of the rivers…
Amanda: [dramatically] We got stuck in this…in this whirlpool, in this riptide, oh no!
Mike: We just want to get our things punched and go to the next slide.
Julia: Yeah, we just finish earth…?
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: [whispers] That's the last one…
Amanda: At the end of the series. There was a lesbian and it was really exciting!
Julia: It was.
[brief pause]
Bisexual.
Amanda: Bisexual person.
Julia: By rep.
Brandon (as Lifeguard): Bruh.
Julia: Bruh.
Brandon (as Lifeguard): Glad you’re chill brah.…
Mike: Bruh.
Brandon (as Lifeguard): I’m glad you didn't drown.
Mike: Thanks, bro
Eric: You see that another lifeguard runs up and this is a 5 foot tall…a woman who was in like a bath…she is like one of those…
Mike: Is she is running in slow motion?
Eric: She is running in slow motion.
Julia: Cool, cool, cool.
Eric: But, I didn’t say anything about her and her body type. That’s just how she runs.
Mike: She runs in slow motion.
Eric: And she runs over and says,
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Sir!
Eric: And she runs up to Mike and she says,
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): [yelling emphatically] Sir! Sir! I needed to get down. You've obviously been involved in a drowning. You need to stay calm. Sir! Sir! Please sit down.
Mike: I sit down. I sit down!
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Gervin? Gervin! You didn't perform any of the steps that you need to do in order to perform CPR!
Julia: I go, I'm sorry. Is that a child drowning? And then I put the hat on Mike.
[Mike and Amanda gasp]
Eric: Okay, um, what do I have to do? What is the item say?
Julia: DC 13 Perception check.
Eric: Okay, Brandon, we both need to make a DC Perception check..
Mike: I'm wearing it in spirits.
Amanda: So, roll a d20, Mike.
Mike: Oh, I do? Okay.
[die roll]
That’s an 18 + anything…?
Julia: That’s Perception.
Amanda: You beat it. You just had to beat 13.
Mike: I beat 13!
Eric: Okay. Both Gervin and the lifeguard just straight up failed.
Julia: Great!
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Girvan, you lost them!
Amanda: Oh no!!
Julia: Can we get our punch cards punched while you try and find this team that you saw? The drowning child?
Brandon (as Gervin): Where am I going?
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Gervin?! Why do you… the guy drowned and then he disappeared? How are you able to find some how you supposed to get CPR training, if you can't even find the person after they drown!?
Julia: You probably want to close down this ride. Can you just punch our cards and we can leave? Evacuate the area?
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Excuse me ma’am, I’m too busy yelling at Gervin!
Julia: I understand.
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): And sir? You're different Sir? You look great. I love your hat.
Mike: Thank you!
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Sir, can you please clear the area? We’re trying to do CPR.
Mike: Sure, I will clear the area. Just please punch the punch cards.
Amanda, Julia, and Mike: [together] Please?
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Gervin?
Brandon (as Gervin): Yeah?
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): Gervin?
Brandon (as Gervin): Yeah?
Eric (as Other Lifeguard): This is your chance…
Mike: I go to Gervin and I’m like, ‘Bruh’…I speak Long Island.
[everyone starts yelling Bruh!]
Brandon:I punch Mike’s punch card.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: I also speak Long Island.
Brandon (as Gervin): BRUHHHH.
Brandon:I punch Julia’s punch card.
Amanda: And in finance bro, I say, ‘Brah’.
Brandon: [confused] Brah?
Amanda: Bruhhhh!
[everyone starts yelling Bruh!]
Brandon:I punch Amanda’s punchcard.
Julia: Let’s bounce.
Eric: As you walk away, you still hear the 5 foot tall lifeguard woman berating Gervin.
Julia: [whispers] Damn it Gervin.
Amanda: That seems fair to be honest.
[low whistle]
Julia: Alright, we got one more let's do this!
Eric: Okay, you guys run over to the wave pool. So, as you walk over to the wave pool, you see that there is a lifeguard who is in a very tall seat, who is standing at the wave pool. And they’re kind of like, watching kids and like hanging out, probably playing like a PSP or something.
Julia: Checks out.
Amanda: Wow!
Julia: That safety.
Amanda: Safety features.
[someone in audience cackling with vigor]
Eric: Someone super loving that PSP reference, thank you.
Julia: Thank you…
Eric: In between here and the…in between where you're standing and the wave pool is this massive multicolored castle. It has like battlements, and it has like a moat. It has like another moat. And it also has, like, a door they can get cranked up. And you look up on the battlements, and you see that there are three 14-year old boys leering at you.
Julia: The worst amount of boys.
[Amanda and Mike groan]
Eric: You know their names all rhyme….
Julia: Yeah…
Mike: Brayden, Trayden, and Jayden.
Julia: I was going to go, Ryan, Brian, and Kyle. That doesn’t work.
[Amanda chuckles]
Eric: Kyle, and Lyle, and…
Mike: Kyle, but they’re all spelled differently.
Eric: Ryan, Briann with two n's, and Kyyyyylin with five y’s.
Julia: Checks out. Thanks Long Island.
Eric: And they are standing on top of the battlements and they have their hands on some very brightly colored plastic instruments. One of them has two hands on what looks like a water gun version of a ballistic gun. The second one has two hands on like a massive like captain's wheel? And the third one is just like hovering over a big red button.
Mike: Okay.
Amanda: So, this is blocking our way into the wave pool?
Eric: So, you know, so you it's like on the side…So there’s a path…
Amanda: Ah, prime for attack.
Eric: And there is the…to your left is the castle and in front of you, like 200 feet away, is the wave pool.
Julia: How tall is the castle? Like, how high up are they?
Eric: They’re pretty high up. Like I would say that Splish Splash Water Bash doesn't have great safety regulations! Definitely like 10 feet up.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Any ideas guys?
Mike: I yell at them and say, Hey, kids! What's your names?
Eric: One of them says,
Eric (as Ryan): Ryan!
Eric: And one of them says,
Eric (as Brian): Brian!
Eric: And one of them says,
Eric (as Other One): Shut up!
[everyone laughing]
Mike: I say cool! I heard some other kids saying that you guys were bad at flossing. You should prove them wrong.
Eric (as Brian): [upset] What?!?!? I'm really great at flossing!!!
Mike: Prove it.
Eric (as Brian): Okay, fine!
[die rolls]
Eric: I got a nat 20 on the second one.
Julia: So one of them is very good at flossing.
[everyone laughing]
Eric: [laughing] So I rolled a 19, a nat 20, and a 4!
[everyone laughing heartily]
Julia: Shut up is really bad at flossing.
Eric: So Ryan is like flossing super hard and Brian is just like hitting it!
Julia: He might as well be in Fortnite.
Eric: So hard he pulls something! And Kyle is just like…my dad doesn't let me have Fortnite! I don’t get it.
Mike: We-we sneak by while they’re flossing.
Amanda: We sure do.
Julia: Yes!
Eric: Hold on! So, I want the three of you, how do you… do you want to run or do you want to sneak?
Mike: Sneak because if we run, we might slip.
Amanda: Yeah, like by the base of the towers. They don't have a lot of visibility
Mike: True.
Eric: Okay, so I want you all to roll Stealth rolls.
Mike: [whispers] Stealth…
Eric: So it should be in Dexterity?
Julia: 14.
Mike: Erm, that’s a 5+2 for a non-natural 7.
Amanda: 11.
Eric:14, 11, 7?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Alright Julia, using your superior core strength that you have because you exercise and the rest of us don't.
Julia: I did so many planks.
Eric: [chuckles] You are able to get pretty far across and as you're running across you see that there are these little like, holes in the ground? that are like disparate points throughout the…the floor.
Julia: Oh they’re probably like water geysers are something.
Amanda: Mhm.
Eric: Mike and Amanda, you try to hoof it and Mike you're too busy laughing at the 14-year old who you made feel bad about his dad.
Julia: Awww, why?
Eric: From keeping him from playing Fortnite.
Mike: That plays, that plays.
Amanda: Listen guys! All bullies have hurt underneath them.
[Eric cackles]
Julia: Are you saying Mike can’t floss?
Eric: And Amanda you're just not fast enough to get out. So, while Brian and Ryan are just flossing so freaking hard, just like their lives depend on it! Like T-Pain is going to be there and he's going to come out and be like,
Eric (as T-Pain): Yo, you're so good!
Eric: In post, will you auto tune this, Brandon?
Brandon:No.
[audience laughs]
Eric: Okay, fine. He's like…
Eric (as T-Pain): [partially singing] You're so good at flossing!!
Eric: But Kylen is just like,
Eric (as Kylen): No, HEY, HEY, HEY! Stop it!
Eric: And he hits the big red button.
Amanda: Oh no.
Mike: Can I throw my basketball at him first?
Eric: [chuckles] Sure. Okay…
Julia: Bring me that action!
Eric: You want to throw the basketball up 10 feet at some kid who is up on a battlement?
Mike: Yeah!
[audience laughs]
Eric: Okay, So I want you to make an attack roll…
Mike: Cool.
Eric: So it should be on your stats, so you roll a d20 and then you add your Dexterity and your proficiency.
Mike: Okay, so, I rolled a 10 with that. My dexterity is a 2. And then do I roll…
Eric: And then proficiency you get a +2.
Mike: Okay. So that’s a 14.
Amanda: Just like him!! Wowww!
Eric: I want to see if Kylen gets out of the way.
[dice roll]
Okay, so Kylen rolled an 18. So you throw the basketball and it's definitely on target. But he's just like seething with [chuckles] teenager rage and he sees it coming and it bounces off the side of his shoulder and just kind of like bounces off to over to the side and be like,
Eric (as Kylen): Hey, buddy! Hey!! And he hits the big red button. And you guys hear just like this loud, loud, alarm that, like, resonates throughout the entire…through the entire area.
Amanda: Where was this when there was a drowning?
[Mike laughs heartily, alarm starts]
Eric: Brandon, make it deeper.
Brandon:Make it deeper?
[slightly deeper alarm sound]
Eric: Yeah, that’s fine. I want everyone to make a Perception check.
Amanda: I think we should keep running.
Mike: Yes, please.
Julia: I’m already past…
[die rolls]
Amanda: I got an 8.
Mike: I got a ten.
Julia: I also got an 8.
Okay, you guys are all looking around to figure out where the hell this alarm is coming from. And like it's coming…like you look over the castle and you look at Kylen and he's giving you two middle fingers now. And Brian and Ryan have stopped flossing incredibly hard and is giving you middle fingers now.
Julia: Oh, no, no.
Eric: Actually Brian with his nat 20 is flossing with one hand, [laughing] and middle finger in the other hand.
Eric (as Kylen): How does he do it?!
Amanda: It still looks good! How does his knees move in those directions?!
Eric: [laughs] And you guys, at the last second, see that Kylen is pointing, he's not just giving you the middle finger, but he's pointing at something behind you.
Julia: Uh oh.
Eric: And you see that there is another castle behind you. But there aren't any battlements on this one. Like on the other side of the…of the road. There aren't any battlements on this one. There is just a giant cup, that is holding gallons and gallons of water and it currently is pouring on top of the roof that is now flooding down, and is about to hit you all in the face.
Amanda: Can we jump back against the wall? Any odds?
Eric: Do you have an idea?
Julia: I wanted to… it will only help me and I don't want to abandon my teammates.
[podcasters chuckle]
Amanda: Can I pull an umbrella out of my introvert’s survival kit?
Eric: Do it.
Amanda: [sadly] I got an eight.
Eric: Okay, Amanda you reach into the survival kit. You're like oh, something needs to save me now, it's gonna be so wet! I really gotta save my friends! And you pull out you reach in. [laughing] And there's a squishy banana.
[audience laughing]
Mike: I eat the squishy banana.
Amanda: For strength!!
Mike: Mhm.
Mike and Amanda: [yelling, together] FOR POTASSIUM!
Julia: Yay…
Eric: Alright, everyone takes 10 points of water damage.
Amanda: That is a lot of water damage!
Eric: It’s a lot of water!
Julia: Oh no..
Eric: How many points of HP do you guys have?
Julia: 5!
Mike: Down to 4!
Amanda: 7!
Julia: How are you so HPed?
Amanda: Because potassium rewards the rich.
Eric: It’s true. So the way that I created this is that Amanda and Julia both have low constitution because like I said, Julia can’t drink brown liquor and Amanda can’t eat anything?
Amanda: No.
Julia: Except for the squished banana?
Amanda: My tum is exceptionally weak.
Eric: So she has low constitution. So you guys are just drenched. You're just dripping from your suits now. And the three teenage boys on the other side are just laughing at you. They're laughing.
Amanda: Hey, okay! Good prank, you got us. Can you punch our punch cards now please?
Julia: They…they don’t have the punch card do they?
Mike: No, no. We have to go to the wave pool.
Eric (as Kylen): What are you talking about? Why would I have a jooob?
Julia: It’s true, you’re a teen.
Eric (as Kylen): They won't even hire me at the Tastee Freez!
Julia: Aw...
Amanda: Worth a try! Alright let's proceed.
Eric: And Kylen is just like,
Eric (as Kylen): Sometimes! I work with my dad at the construction site!
Julia: We’re already walking away.
Mike: Yeah, we’re not…
Julia: No more. I don’t want to hear your sob story.
Eric (as Kylen): He won’t let me play Fortnite, because he says it rots my brains!!
Mike: It does!!
Julia: [quietly chants] Wave pool! Wave pool!
Eric: So you guys are over at the wave pool and yeah, the wave pool is super chill. It's just like… it's really low. It's like it feels very manufactured. Like you know there are no waves like this. And it's just like super chill. The only people who are in there right now are like is a woman with like eight toddlers.
Julia: Okay. I gently dip in and then I go to the lifeguard and go like, please! Stop playing Spyro, please!
Eric (as Lifeguard): Oh, wait! Oh, I just got to the save point. It's fine. Okay, cool, cool.
Julia: Sweet, great.
Eric (as Lifeguard): Yeah, you guys need a punch card?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric (as Lifeguard): Oh! you guys got like super wet.
Julia and Mike: [together] Yes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric (as Lifeguard): Oh, nice. Very chill.
Mike: It’s pretty chill.
Eric (as Lifeguard): It is pretty chill, it’s nice.
Mike: We kept it wavy.
Eric (as Lifeguard): Yeah. Oh, I see. Because it’s the wave pool?
Mike: Yeah.
Eric (as Lifeguard): Oh, I got it. Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice. Cool, cool, cool.
Julia: [patiently frustrated] We have so little time, please!
Amanda: Do we have like a waterproof pocket in our bathing suits? How are these not getting wet?
Eric: Yeah, so they are laminated.
Julia: They’re poorly laminated.
Eric: And you also had a waterproof pocket.
Amanda: One of those back of the leggings pockets?
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Clutch.
Eric: Absolutely. So he punches all of them. You do have all three punched.
Mike: Great.
Amanda: Great.
Mike: Okay, we go to the big cabana thing.
Amanda: Yeah!!
Julia: Because it’s right over here, right?! It’s right by the wave pool?
Eric: So you guys…you guys can walk around and you see that behind the wave pool is this like little stone path that leads to this...this giant cabana. Like it's a cabana the size of a house.
Amanda: [gasps] I want it!
Mike: Let’s go inside.
Eric: You go inside…
Amanda: Are there giant towels?
Mike: Well, let’s go inside, there’s 8 minutes left.
Amanda: C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!
Eric: So you guys are standing in front of the cabana. You try the door and it’s locked. And you see that there's this little like metal panel and it opens up and this little robot hand puts its hand out.
Julia: I put my punch card in it.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: Oh…
Eric: So it puts it’s pointer finger, its middle finger, it’s ring finger, in the three punch holes and it says,
Eric (as Robot): Welcome to the cool cabana.
Julia: Sweeet.
Eric (as Robot): Have a fun time, Juliaaaa.
Julia: Ugh, I don’t like it. I hate it so much.
Mike:I give him my punch card.
Eric: Alright. It does all that and it says...
Eric (as Robot): Welcome to the cabana, Schubessss.
Mike: I give it a secret handshake.
Amanda: Oh!
Eric: Ah! Okay. What do you do?
Julia: What does that look like?
Eric: Oh, I do the one from the School of Rock.
Eric: Oh, nice.
Mike: Yeah, slap it and then you do the makeup platform in the middle. Let's rock, Let's rock today.
Eric (as Robot): Let’s ROCK, Let’s ROCK, Let’s ROCK tonight.
Mike: [correcting] Today.
Eric (as Robot): Todayyyy.
Mike: Slap it, shoot it, kaboot it.
Eric (as Robot): Todayyyyy. Error, error, error.
[sounds of tech turning off]
Julia: 7 minutes.
Amanda: I don’t know! I put mine in.
Eric: Okay, so it says...
Eric (as Robot): Welcome back Amanda: VIP member. Please look to your left where you have entered in all of your favorite foods, non-dairy ice cream, rice, and a plate of various things you find in your cabinettt.
[audience laughs]
Amanda: It’s true.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: I give it a thumbs up.
Eric: Nice.
Eric (as Robot): Thank you now have 100,000 bonus points
Mike: Amanda, you come here A LOT.
Julia: Why?
Amanda: Let's talk about it later.
[Eric and audience laugh]
Eric: So you go inside the cabana and it's beautiful in there. There are just giant towels and there's all the food you can think. There are Amanda's specialty foods in there but next door there's just like burgers and fries and mozzarella sticks.
Julia: Yeah!
Eric: And like…
Julia: I grab so many mozzarella sticks.
Eric: That's fine. That's your right.
Julia: Yeah, thank you.
Eric: You have mozzarella sticks and there's like there's a…there's NBA Jam in the corner.
[Amanda gasps]
Mike: I go play NBA JAM!
Julia: We have a mission!
Mike: Fine! Okay! Let’s do this quick so we can play NBA Jam!
Eric: [cackling] I knew I would get you with that one. And there's like a fireplace and there's like there's also a washing machine, if you want to dry anything. Anything in your heart's content is in this cabana.
Amanda: Damn.
Mike: Okay,
Julia: If I dry myself, will I get my HP back?
Eric: I…you can try?
Amanda: We have 5 ½ minutes left, let’s find the DM! Is the DM or a cassette player in here?
Eric: What doesn’t everyone make an Investigation roll?
Julia: 6.
Mike: Oh! That is a natural 1.
Julia: Oh, Jesus.
Amanda: I got an 18.
Julia: Oh, thank god.
Eric: So Mike…so Mike is actually playing NBA Jam.
Julia: I like, lost track of him all of a sudden it was like wait.
Mike: [yelling] Oh, c’mon Stockton!
Eric: Uh, and Julia, you're too busy eating mozzarella sticks.
Julia: I understand.
Eric: And Amanda, you remember what the cassette said before? Is that you need to find…I can just read it back to you because I have notes. It says
Eric (as Dungeon Master): You will have 50 minutes to complete my puzzums and walk through the blue door at the end.
Julia: Where's the blue door Amanda?
Amanda: Was the cabana door blue?
Eric: No.
Amanda: Was there one in here?
Eric: No, there is no…you do look around. And you do not see a blue door.
Mike: Do we see any doors?
Eric: Yes. So the other front door that you were in. And then there is there are two doors on the other side of the room.
Mike: Are…is there blue paint anywhere?
Eric: No.
Mike: Damn it.
Julia: What color are the doors?
Amanda: Open up both doors and see what’s through them.
Eric: Okay. So you open up the first door and he's just like a towel room. And just like super fluffy towels.
Amanda: A different kind of reward.
Eric: Yeah. So you open the other door and the other door is really strange because you open it up and there's, like, nothing there? And Amanda, you look down and there's a diving board. Just like to 2 feet out it's just like, darkness.
Amanda: I close my eyes and jump.
Eric: You do?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Alright. Amanda, I want you to make an Acrobatics roll.
Amanda: Oh, God. [brief pause] Well, I got a 2-1.
[everyone laughs]
Eric: Amanda, if you were to fail, jumping into a pool with the diving board, what would happen to you?
Amanda: I think I would miss the diving board and just jump.
Eric: [laughing hard] Your eyes aren't open. Okay, so you guys…Mike, you're just playing NBA jam. And Julia you're just stuffing as many mozzarella sticks…sticks into your mouth. And you see and then you just see Amanda's gone. And the door is open and you guys look over and there's a diving board that goes into nothing.
Julia: Okay, I’m going to jump in as well.
Mike: Yes.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: Thanks, guys.
Eric: How do you want to jump in?
Julia: Swan dive.
Eric: Okay.
Mike: I want to I want to do a…round off.
Eric: Alright, everyone make an acrobatics roll.
Julia: Alright, 15+2, so a 17.
Mike: 18+ 2 for a non-natural 20!
Eric: Oh nice! Very good. Very good. Okay, you guys. Julia. You do it, actually. You jump in first and Mike, you see her just kind of disappear into the nothingness. And what do you do with the non-natural 20?
Mike: A roundoff? It's like the one where you do a cartwheel, but then you like turn into that you like land on two feet facing backwards and jump into a backflip.
Amanda: Oh damn.
Eric: Simone Biles apparently.
Mike: My dad actually was a diver, so this kind of checks out.
Julia: We have 3 minutes.
Eric: You have 2 minutes and 45 seconds. Is that okay?
Mike: No it’s good, we’re good! I do it and it looks great.
Eric: Okay, so Mike, you jumped off of the diving board and you are spinning through the darkness and you feel like you're just falling and falling and falling. And suddenly you hit something cold. And you look down, and it is just the bluest water that you are you are coming into.
Amanda: Yeah…
Eric: It's like, I don't even like an Acid Lake, or just like a lake you would see on National Geographic. There's just so…so blue. You guys know what I’m talking about, you’re on tumbler.
Mike: Anyway, we have two minutes, let’s go.
Eric: Yeah, it's fine. Mike immediately you open your eyes and you're in your bed at night. And you look around and it's 3:30 in the morning, and you look over and you touch your lucky Knicks basketball. And it's still there. You had the weirdest dream, man. I can't believe it.
Mike: But How did I wake up wearing this one piece swimsuit?!
Eric: And you look over to the chair that's next to your bed, and there was a sopping wet, old timey 1950s bathing suit. And that is Dungeon and Dragons – In Reality.
Julia: We did it with 1 minute 30 seconds left.
Eric: They did it with 1 minute and 35 seconds left. They were trapped in terrible eternity forever.
Amanda: Sweet.
Eric: Yeah, that's kind of what happens! It’s really dark if they don't do it.
So, thank you so much to my players. Yeah! Mike.This is Mike’s third time playing Dungeons and Dragons! It’s Julia’s first time doing this, and Amanda doesn't really like games so that’s a big deal. Thank you so much to Brandon, who was my NPC and also my Foley. Yeah... Alright. Thank you so much!"

Transcript
[theme music]
Amanda: If you know anything about me, you know that I really love goats. So…
[everyone laughs]
When we were…you're laughing, but this is how we're starting.
[everyone chuckles]
Because when we were discussing what we could possibly be doing over our summer break, one of the ideas was this wonderful one page RPG by Grant Howitt called Goat Crashers! Which I have been calling Goat Party in my head for about 6 months, not knowing that wasn't the real name of it until today.
[Eric, Brandon, and Lauren laugh]
So thanks Grant! And we'll put the link to the original RPG in the description, of course.
So, this is a very exciting game because you get to be cheeky little goats! And your…your goal in this game is just to party! So, I'm going to explain to you really quick how the game works. Then we're going to roll up our characters. Then we are going to play Goat Crashers.
Y’all ready?
Brandon: Yeah!
Lauren: Hell yes!
Eric: I am. [short pause] Wait…one of you isn’t Brandon.
[Lauren laughs]
Brandon: We’re both Brandon!
Amanda: Hi! Welcome fellow RPG podcaster Lauren Shippen! How are you?
Eric: HEYY! It’ Lauren Shippen!
Lauren: Thank you so much for having me, I’m so excited to BE A GOAT!
Eric: I think just as important is that I, Eric Silver, usual DM…
[Brandon laughs heartily]
Get to not be that, and I get to play, so I am VERY EXCITED! [chuckles] Nothing different about Brandon. He's a robot in this one too.
[Lauren and Eric laugh]
[Brandon and Lauren chant Robo-Goat]
Amanda: Listen, it isn’t one of the choices, but we can make it so.
[Lauren chuckles]
Let's actually get to it. So everyone has a d6 in front of them. And we are going to roll what kind of goat you're going to be, what your favorite goat thing is to do, which is going to kinda be like you're sort of special skill that'll give you special bonuses. And then finally, what you want to do with the party.
So let's start with Brandon. Again Robo-Goat, not one of the choices, but please roll with the d6 and tell me what kind of goat you are.
Brandon: That’s very limiting.
[dice rolls, Eric immediately laughs in response to roll]
Amanda: Nice!
Eric: I love Brandon and starting out be like, “Fuck this! Why can't I be a robot with con…constraints?”
Brandon: Oh, don’t worry, I got something just as good. [pauses for effect] Satanic…
[everyone gasps]
I’m a metalhead goat.
Amanda: So you’re an occult goat?
Brandon: Mhm.
Amanda: Excellent. And If you could please roll again and tell me your favorite goat thing to do.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: Just eating stuff. Or, just tasting it.
Amanda: Good. I love it. I don't judge. Love it. And then Brandon, finally, if you could take a d10 and tell me what you want to do at this party. What is your goal? What is your motivation? Your mo-goativation?
Brandon: I was looking for it? No reason to fight it, I'm glad you took it.
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: Alright.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: Wow, that actually works nicely.
Amanda: That’s perfect.
Brandon: Um, I'm just…I just want to eat cake.
Amanda: Beautiful. I just want to eat…NONE OF THAT FONDANT SHIT.
[Eric and Lauren laugh]
Amanda: [taken aback] Wow…
[Eric continues laughing]
This is like your kids going to someone else's house for a playdate and they act TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY.
[Lauren laughs heartily]
Eric: As soon as you can wear shoes inside, all rules are off!!
Amanda: Model player Lauren Shippen, could you please tell me what type of goat you are?
Lauren: [chuckles] Oh my goodness, so much pressure!
Amanda: Well, this is my Ship now, bae-by!
[dice rolls]
Brandon: [quietly] You're Shippen?
Lauren: [excitedly] Oh! I am a pygmy goat? Yes!!!
Brandon: [in mild excitement] Yeah…
Eric: Tiny goat!
Lauren: Tiny goat!!!!
Amanda: TINY GOAT. Your Smallness, what is your favorite thing to do?
Lauren: My favorite thing to do…is running around.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: YES!!! So small…Such a good goat!
Eric: Such a good goat.
Amanda: [joyfully] And you have to cover so much distance!
Lauren: [laughs jovially] That’s the best!
Amanda: A pygmy goat who likes to run, what do you want to do at the party?
[dice rolls]
Lauren: I want to get one of these goody bags.
[Amanda gasps in approval]
Brandon: What a mischievous small goat!
Lauren: Tiny little mischievous goat!
Brandon: Is there an iPod in there?
Eric: I bet there’s a Zune.
[everyone laughs]
Amanda: How do you do it with hooves?
Eric: Why isn’t the Zune hoof compatible?
Brandon: She can fit in the goody bag!
[Amanda and Lauren aww]
Lauren: So small!
Amanda: He just wants a new little house.
[everyone chuckles softly]
Eric: Alright, well, Lauren roll. Let’s see if you find a new house.
[Lauren laughs]
Amanda: Hey, excuse me, sir. I'm the DM here…
Eric: Oop, I’m sorry.
Amanda: Sorry, I’m the GM here, the Goat Master.
Eric: Ahhh, there it is.
Amanda: Eric, please tell me what kind of goat you are.
Eric: Alright, big money. Come on.
[dice rolls]
Eric: YES. [woos] I am the fainting goat!!
Brandon: Oh my god.
Amanda: Uh oh.
Eric: Yesss! Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Amanda: [mildly irked] He asked me if he could pick that, and I said no. And then he rolled…
Brandon: My favorite thing is that it's audio, so the audience is just gonna hear nothing when you faint.
Eric: It’s just going to go…[makes light womp sound].
Brandon: No sound effects, it’s just going to be like…
Eric: No Brandon, Brandon. Put in that Foley, please.
[dice rolls]
My favorite thing to do are, headbutts?
Brandon: That seems counterintuitive to your function as a goat.
Eric: Brandon, all of our…
Amanda: Unless…Unless when you faint, you accidentally headbutt something or someone on your way down?
[Brandon laughs heartily]
Eric: Hey Brandon, I wasn't critical of your character, so why don't you let my character live? I…also, my character is also a barbarian.
Amanda: OK, OK, let's focus on our motivation here on our plot and tell me Eric, what you want to do with the party, this headbutting fainting goat.
Eric: Okay, this is what I really want. But let's see what happens.
[dice rolls]
I got a 5, and it's dance with an heiress.
[Brandon and Amanda laugh softly]
Eric: Alright…
Amanda: Lots of conflicting things here.
Eric: Listen, I just need to follow my dreams. Narcolepsy is not going to keep me from dancing with the heir of the tartar sauce fortune.
[Lauren chuckles]
Amanda: Excellent. Bill Tartar.
Brandon: Anastasia Tartar.
[Amanda chuckles]
Lauren: The last of the Tartars.
Eric: Bilomina Tartar.
Amanda: Mhm, mhm.
Eric: But she goes by Bill.
Amanda: And now I am going to roll to say what secretly is going on at this party, that you guys aren't going to know about. I get to protect my roll, and then laugh…while looking and making uncomfortable eye contact with all of you.
[Eric and Brandon chuckle]
Just like our DM normally does.
[everyone laughs heartily]
Brandon: This is the whole reason she wanted to DM: for that joke.
Eric: Just for that moment.
[Lauren giggles]
Amanda: Oh, I’m just warming up. Don’t worry, don’t worry.
[Brandon chuckles]
I really wanted to…to Goat Master this session so that I could bring you to my favorite place in the world. But before we get there, why don't I tell you how this is going to work.
Basically, you want to achieve your goal: you want to party. You are here at a party, but the only problem is that the party is run by humans. So people, eventually, may notice that you are [short pause] goats and try to kick you out.
[Eric laughs]
So what you're going to do is, every turn you get to do something, try to get further to your goal. When you want to do something risky, you have to roll your 2 d6 that are in front of you. If you are doing your special goat skill, then you get to add 2 more d6. And basically, if it's a 4 or 5 or 6 that you end up rolling, it's a success. If you roll beneath a 4, it is a failure. So the more successes you roll, the better the action goes. But if you start doing stuff that’s suspicious or you roll and there's no successes, or just 1, which means it's a little bit challenging for you to do. But as people start to notice that maybe there are some goats at this party, I am going to add some dice to something called a chaos pool.
So, this is sort of the sense of like the party's atmosphere getting more and more suspicious. So, if I end up rolling, ultimately more chaos’ then you roll successes, then things do not go well for you. Again, if you're 1 ahead of me, if you're 1 success above the chaos, then it goes sort of partially well, and things get a little bit more difficult.
And each of you have this special goat power where each person one time during the session can party hard!! And access the power of chaos. So this means that you grab all the dice in the chaos pool and you add them to your hand. You roll them, it's unopposed, you're going to succeed no matter what. And then the chaos pool resets and is at 0. It's basically party so hard the party forgets who you are and they're just like, “Whoever this is…love them.''
Brandon: So I can literally summon Cthulhu, it’s beautiful.
Eric: What kind of parties do you go to?
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: Brandon is going to do what he does at every party and is going to like, summon Cthulhu.
[Lauren continues laughing]
That was the worst Christmas party I've ever been to.
Amanda: Would anyone like to tell me their goat’s name? Your motivation? What you're doing?
You don't know what party you’re at but tell me a little bit more about who you are.
Eric: Uh, My goats’ name is Montgomery C. Abernathy IV…
[Lauren chuckles]
Brandon: Stunning.
Eric: But yeah, I just go by Montgomery.
[Lauren laughs]
See…Montgomery C. Abernathy III was my father. Calveit Montgomery C. Abernathy IV.
Brandon: How do you feel about Monty?
Eric: No thank you.
Lauren: [chuckles] Gomery?
Eric: That's not even…I don't even know what that is. I can’t even process that.
Um, Montgomery came from a long lineage of royal goats. But he was cast out for, you know, having a fainting problem.
Amanda: Mhm, mhm.
Eric: So now he's tried to find his new fortune in the big city. And he knows the best way to do that is to dance with an heiress and hopefully get her to fall in love with him. And that's why he's…he's going after Belomina Tartar, the heir to the tartar sauce fortune.
Amanda: Great, love it.
Brandon: If you're in-character Eric, will require you to bley tap me.
Eric: Okay, that's fine.
Brandon: Thank you.
Eric: I mean in-character if it's goat-to-goat, I'm going to speak like a goat language.
Amanda: Oh no, this is Dr. Who rules, where we’re automatically translated to the language of the audience.
[Lauren chuckles]
Eric: Okay, got it.
[Eric merrrs like a goat]
My goat-to-goat GGG voice, [with slow, southern-like drawl] I’m Mon-Montgomery…
Brandon: Oh no…
Eric: [continuing] C. Abernathy IV…
Lauren: I’m sorry what?
Amanda: Wow.
Eric: [continues in drawl] My name is…Montgomery C. Abernathy IV. And I’m here to take my crown back. Beeehhh.
[short pause]
Amanda: Oh no, he fainted.
Eric: Oh no!
[Lauren laughs]
Amanda: Alright Lauren, what is your goat’s name?
Lauren: My goat’s name is Daisy.
Amanda: Amazing. What else could it be?
Lauren: And this is her first ever party.
[Eric laughs heartily]
Lauren: She doesn’t spend a lot of time indoors. I'm assuming this party is indoors, so it might be an outdoor fet. And you know, running…running is her greatest delight but things have been a little…the luster of running has…has worn out a little bit and so she's looking to get some interesting things.
Amanda: Okay.
She wants these goody bags.
Amanda: Some greener pastures.
Amanda: Yeah, she hears that some parties have things that you can take home and she's very intrigued by that.
Amanda: Love it. Brandon, Tell me about your occult goat and how they have, I don't want to say fallen into, but come to this lifestyle.
Brandon: Mm, what's funnier? Keith or Cupcake?
Lauren: Cupcake.
Amanda: Cupcake.
Eric: Keith Cupcake.
[everyone chuckles]
Amanda: Cupcake Heathcliff III.
Eric: Heathcliff Cupcake III.
Amanda: Yes!
Eric: But everyone calls me, “Cup”.
Brandon: Yeah, that's 100% what it is! It's Heathcliff Cupcake III and everyone calls him Cup!
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: Goats have a long tradition of natural-lineal naming.
Brandon: Um, Heathcliff Cup, it’s not that he's fallen into it…he's just dabbling right now.
Amanda: Mm. Okay, okay.
Brandon: You know, he hasn't quite told his parents about it yet but he's figuring it out. Um, he’s hoping that he'll meet some like-minded people at this party.
Amanda: Okay!
Brandon: But mainly he just wants to eat stuff…or at least taste it.
Amanda: Okay, okay.
[Eric laughs, Amanda joins in]
Brandon: That doesn’t include the furniture but does include the wallpaper. It also includes lots of people's hands and feet…
Amanda: Maybe the gift bag, mm?
Brandon: Probably the gift bag.
Amanda: Maybe Miss Tartar?
Brandon: [mischievously] Oh…!!!
Eric: [strictly] No! You stay away!
[Lauren laughs]
Eric (as Montgomery): [southern-drawl accent] Nahh, you stay away from Miss Tartar [breaks accent and laughs], she’s mine!!!
Brandon: Everything is definitely cake and he will summon some demons to get that cake. You know what I mean?
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: So does, first of all…
Brandon: I don't…
Eric: Does Cup have a thing that he says before he goes to town?
Brandon: On anything or cake?
Eric: Anything.
Brandon: Uh, anything, no, he's very…he's very quiet about when he’s just licking things.
[Eric and Amanda laugh]
Amanda: Under the radar, weirdly I'm having deja vu right now. Which I never could’ve seen coming!
[everyone laughs]
Lauren: You couldn’t have imagined this exact scenario?
Amanda: No, no, no, I sure didn't.
[Amanda and Eric laugh]
Brandon: But when we get to the cake, you'll have to find out what the play is, Eric.
Eric: [cackles] Did you just tease a future game?
Brandon: Yeah! I bought myself sometimes when I did.
[everyone chuckles]
Amanda: Well why don't we learn a little bit more about our world? Let me set the scene for you, here in our goat party.
It is springtime. The trees are blooming. The grass is growing. Goats everywhere are frolicking, running in the sun. And even in this concrete jungle of New York City, you can tell that spring is here. Everywhere, trees are getting green again. And that's no truer than in Central Park.
It is busy today. People are taking their lunch into the park. The squirrels are building their nests and the birds are migrating home for summer. But one section is busier than all the others. Along the eastern edge of the park on Fifth Avenue, people are swarming around this big white building. There are trucks in the loading bay, there are throngs of movers and construction workers around back…
Eric: Jesus Christ…
[Lauren laughs heartily]
Amanda: Excuse me, I’m doing my scene sitting here, sir!
[everyone laughs]
I know you don't respect the arts!!
[continued laughing]
Eric: Wow!
Amanda: A narrative!
Eric: [whispers] Wow…
Amanda: Excuse me, back to my paragraph.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: There are trucks, there are construction workers, and there are dozens of well-dressed headset-wearing staffers running in and out of the front entrance…in ballgowns?
They actually covered the whole front of the building in a big plastic tent. It's almost 30 feet tall. And it encases the grand steps and matching sets of double doors in this sort of plastic bubble. Down where the tent meets the sidewalk, police barriers are keeping onlookers from walking on the lush, red carpet that's just been laid down.
Something big is going on today.
Brandon: Ima lick that carpet, but anyway, continue.
[Lauren chuckles]
Amanda: And then you remember…Oh right! It's the first Monday in May. You know what that means y'all?
Lauren: Oh Yeah.
Amanda: It’s time for the Met Gala.
Eric: Ohhh god!
Brandon: I need to know everything! Who's the hosts, what's the theme?
Eric: Yeah, what’s the theme?
Lauren: What’s the theme?
Amanda: It is Bacchanalia themed.
Eric: Okay.
Lauren: Very good.
Amanda: Confusingly, lots of people are dressed as goats…
[Eric cackles]
Amanda: Because God Bacchus, in fact, takes a semi-goat form.
Brandon: Now Amanda, I know what that means…
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: But for the listeners at home who may not know or get that theme…
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: [laughs] What would that mean?
Amanda: So, the Met Gala is like high societies’ prom. Happens every year, put on by Vogue, and Anna Wintour, who I don't know may or may not be in attendance tonight. And all of the like well-to-do and celebrities in New York City inexplicably, sometimes Instagram influencers, are invited and they have to dress up in themes.
Everybody looks like they're a museum exhibit. They go into the Met, they eat dinner. Ostensibly, there's some kind of charitable aspect to it. Don't really know what that is. And people are photographed as they come up into the museum on the red carpet.
Brandon: Okay, okay.
Amanda: So, it's about 5:30 today. People are setting up for the red carpet. Folks are going to be arriving very soon. And we have to figure out…
A. Where all of you are waiting, maybe around the corner in the park. And also how you're going to get into the museum. Come join this party.
Brandon: Ohhh…
Lauren: Man, I bet the Met Gala has such good goody bags!!
Amanda: Oh yes! Definitely.
Brandon: Oh, yes. iPads in there.
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric (as Montgomery):I bet there’s a Zunnneee!
[Lauren chuckles]
Brandon: We can essentially get away with being goats with this theme, correct?
Amanda: I think this might be a little bit to your advantage.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: So that people are going to be dressed in various forms of kind of animals.
So, Bacchanalia is like an old fashioned good old like hedonistic party. So lots of…
Brandon: Good old fashioned!
Amanda: Yeah, it's all about like, the carnal pleasures. So people are here. Maybe they'll be dressed up as like a big piece of meat. Maybe they'll be dressed up as Oedipus, risqué, I know. Maybe they'll be dressed up as like grapes because Bacchus is the is the God of the harvest.
Brandon: Okay, I have an idea. I want to pitch an idea out to y’all.
Eric: So this is how it feels being on this side of this?
[everyone laughs]
Brandon: Okay, so part of me dabbling, Mr. Cup, dabbling in the occultism is the first step is he got some red slit contacts, you know.
Amanda: Yeah, all for it. Love it.
Brandon: So he’s already playing this part a little bit, So, let me pitch you this idea. Three goats in a trench coat.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: We get on each other's backs. And we just walk into the…just walk on the red carpet.
Eric: Okay…
Lauren: Only if I can be the top goat because otherwise, I'll be crushed.
Brandon: Oh, no…
Lauren: I’m so small.
Eric: Also, I will faint in the middle of this plan.
Amanda: Oh nooo! Haaa!
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: You’re right, I will… I will have to lick every inch of this carpet, this is a bad plan.
[Eric and Lauren laughing]
Amanda: Okay.
Lauren: Okay, so I'm just sort of along…along the side just munching on a flower over in like, you know, one of the little flower banks.
Amanda: Yeah. There are flower beds encircling the fountains that are kind of right next to the red carpet. So it's within the tent actually, you just kind of walked in through the police barrier.
Lauren: Perfect, yeah, very small. You know, I'm kind of in the area.
Amanda: I see it.
Lauren: And who is on the red carpet right now? What can I See?
Amanda: Primarily, even though he is the shortest and in fact closest to pygmy goat size, Ryan Seacrest? And there are other people around getting earpieces set up, getting lights and cameras set up. Primarily though it is Ryan Seacrest, actually eating a lot of grass and you think, “Wait is that one of us?”. You're not quite sure.
Eric: Okay, I have a plan.
Amanda: How do you know each other?
Eric: Oh, umm…
Amanda: Just three goats in the big city?
Lauren: I've never seen these goats before.
Amanda: [surprised] Oh…
Lauren: I don’t know these guys.
Eric: I found them on…on Goat Friendster.
Amanda: Mhm.
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: Which is this Billy Goat, Billy [searching for it]…Face Billy Goat? I don't know.
Amanda: Okay, okay.
Eric: Face Billy Goat. And I’m distantly related.
Amanda: Hoofbook.
Eric: THANK YOU!!
Amanda: There it is.
Eric: There it is, Hoofbook. And I’m distantly related to both of them.
[Lauren laughs]
And I found them on face…Hoofbook, and I bleated at them.
[Lauren laughing]
Amanda: Are you wearing Bleats headphones?
[Eric laughs]
Lauren: Ding Ding Ding!
Eric (as Montgomery): Arright! Come her cousin…Come her cousins! I think that the best way for us to get into this party is to be a part of the theme. And everyone there's goats themselves…
Eric: And then I fall over and pass out.
[Lauren chuckles]
Brandon: So we can drag him in, do you think?
Eric: And then Montgomery picks himself up pretty quickly and says…
Eric (as Montgomery): Oh, I’m sorry. That happens sometimes. Err, so the best thing I think we should do is get ourselves covered in something, because it’s not just goats. It’s goats and Bacchanalia. So, I think if we find some mud and some wine, that we can be able to cover ourselves and I know just a place to get it.
Eric: And then I fall over again.
[Lauren chuckles]
Amanda: You notice a Vogue staffer in a ball gown, but also with a headset and sneakers on, starts to look over a couple of times at you. Also, then you hear someone say into their mouthpiece, “It’s GA-GA!”.
[Eric and Lauren laugh]
And down the sidewalk, you see a throng of men dressed as shepherds start to walk toward you. With someone behind them or like you see like a little a little quaff kind of bopping in the middle of this group of shepherd men.
Lauren: I run over, with my fast little hooves.
Amanda: Okay. Just right into….
Lauren: Just right along the side, I’m still kind of, you know, keeping my distance but run very quickly.
Amanda: Great. I think no one notices you because it makes total sense that Lady Gaga would bring not just 20 hunks but a goat…
Lauren: A goat.
Amanda: To the Met Gala.
Brandon: I mean, seeing her success, I run after her and stand next to one of the shepherds.
Amanda: Great. You’re beginning to catch up and kind of walk past the point you are at the fountain.
Brandon: Which is the really evilest looking one?
Amanda: One of them has air pods and so I think it's that one.
Eric: Cool.
[Eric and Brandon chuckle]
Brandon: I sit next to that one.
Eric: I get up…I pick myself up, and you two are not around me anymore. Cause I fainted. So I’m going with my plan, which was where I was gonna find a picnic with illegal wine, and I was gonna pour it all over myself as my costume. So I'm a wine-soaked goat.
Amanda: There is a little reception area over by where the limos are pulling up with a table with kind of refreshments. There's like Purell, there's like face cleansing wipes, there's some q-tips, there's some tissues, and there are actually some small little glasses of wine. So, if you wanted to figure out a way to either knock those over, grab them…
Eric: [enthusiastically] Well It just so happens, my favorite thing to do is headbutting…
Amanda: Okay!
Eric: So I’m going to headbutt…run over to the table, and then roll around in the wine that’s on the ground.
Amanda: Okay, please roll for that. Please roll 4 d6, because you're doing normal goat things and also the thing that you're good at.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: I did think that you meant Purell was a refreshment for a second, which was very confusing.
[Amanda and Lauren laugh]
Amanda: For some, Brandon, for some.
Eric: [chuckling] Okay, I only got one success.
Amanda: Okay. Well, luckily, the chaos pool is currently at 0, so you are able to headbutt the table, however only a trickle of wine comes off the side. So it looks more like you have been sort of tie dyed and less covered.
[Lauren laughs]
Eric (as Montgomery): I’ll takkke it! A costume is a costume, baby!
Lauren: I hear the noise of Montgomery crashing into the table, and I look over and I see the table. I think there might be goody bags over there. So I run over there.
Amanda: Okay! Another goat making for it. I think people are starting to look over. Not only is there a spill, but there are two goats….
Eric: [laughing enthusiastically] This game is my favorite!
Amanda: I'm gonna go ahead and add a die to the chaos pool.
Lauren: Okay. Do I see any goody bags?
Amanda: There are no goodie bags on the table no.
Lauren: [disappointed] Man!
Amanda: You have to make it to the end.
Lauren: Okay.
Eric (as Montgomery): Daisy, come roll around in this too!
Lauren: I run around and get my…my hooves covered in some wine.
Amanda: Yeah, Daisy you are low enough to the ground that just one roll would cover you completely if you want it to.
Lauren: Yes, I do one roll.
Amanda: Great.
Lauren: Yeah.
Amanda: So luckily for both of you, it is red and not white wine, and you are now…
[Eric and Lauren laugh]
A deep pink color, which actually quite resembles the red carpet. So, this will give you a little bit of help with your Stealth as you try to make it into the museum.
Lauren: Excellent.
Eric: Can I look back around for rosé?
Eric (as Montgomery): Because I’m a rosé goat.
Amanda: Cup, are you sticking with…with God's posse here?
Brandon: Oh, of course.
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: This is evil eye, red eye goat with Gaga. That's the best…the best disguise I'm ever gonna come up with.
Amanda: Excellent.
Lauren: Has Gaga appeared yet? Or is it just her entourage?
Amanda: So she's actually in the middle of this entourage. And as you may know, in the 2019 Met Gala, she had four different costume changes.
Lauren: Yes.
Amanda: So we have to see in this Goat Party Gala, if she's going to, you know…
Lauren: What is she wearing right now?
Amanda: Right now you can’t actually see her and that is her first her first costume is…
Lauren: Mm…
Brandon: She’s invisible.
Amanda: Anticipation.
[everyone laughs]
So, she is in the middle there we think, but there is mostly just shepherds all on the outside of her. They are all on cell phones. It might be a metaphor?
And so then the group continues up into the Met Museum and everyone sort of like parts as they walk up. Everyone's like looking at their phones trying to tweet, trying to gram that picture. So everyone is actually kind of distracted. Are you going to try to walk into the museum?
Lauren: I want to run in between the legs of her posse using my smallness…
Amanda: Great.
Lauren: And sort of get next to Gaga. Ga-Ga.
Amanda: Wow, Do you do you…
Brandon: Who is that? Who is Gaga?
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: It’s Miss Ga-Ga to you.
Or herr-herr, herrr. Or maybe she was a goat! Because she went, beeahhh-beerarr-baee!
[Lauren laughs]
Eric (as Montgomery): [singing Gaga] I’m off the deep end!
Amanda: This pop culture reference will age EXTREMELY well!
Lauren: So well!
Amanda: Cast 2018.
Eric: Alright, never mind. Lauren, you had a really good action setup.
[everyone chuckles]
Amanda: But Daisy, do you see what Ga-Ga is wearing? Do you have a glimpse?
Lauren: I don't think I do if she's, you know, so surrounded, but I think I'm small enough to fit in between the legs of her entourage?
Amanda: Certainly, certainly.
Lauren: Yeah.
Amanda: Very good. And Montgomery, are you just kind of like rolling, rolling with it trying to blend into the carpet?
Eric: I think I'm just, yeah, I think I’m just walking it because I'm not small enough or fast enough to get in there. So I think I just need to take my chance on the red carpet.
Amanda: Alright, can all three of you please roll? Because it is sort of a risky thing to try to sneak in the museum here.
Lauren: Okay.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: Oh!
Brandon: Question! Are any of the people next to me, like dressed in grapes or like some sort of food item?
Amanda: Uh, they all have ankle bracelets made out of raisins.
Brandon: Okay. If I lick them…
Amanda: Again, metaphor.
Brandon: If I lick them as if, you know, that's what happened at a Bacchanalia, do I get more stuff?
Amanda: You sure do, you can roll 4 d6.
Lauren: I got three 4s.
Amanda: Ooh, three successes, very good.
Eric: I got two successes.
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: Two for two.
[dice shaking and rolling]
Brandon: I Got two successes.
Amanda: Great. Well, the chaos pool did not have any successes, so you all make it into the Met Museum!
[everyone cheers]
Lauren: And I’m now next, to Ga-Ga?
Amanda: Yes.
Lauren: Okay.
Amanda: You are. You notice that she’s actually just in a purple tracksuit.
Lauren: [surprised] Oh!
Amanda: She has her headphones in, and she's bopping along. Actually, could you roll for me and see if you can see up to see what she's listening to on her phone?
Lauren: Yeah.
[dice roll]
One success.
Amanda: It's a podcast, but you can't tell what the title is.
[Lauren sighs]
Sorry. It's gonna haunt you forever.
[Eric and Brandon chuckle]
Lauren: Oh no!
Brandon: That’s too real Amanda, this is fantasy!
[Lauren and Amanda laugh heartily]
Eric: I do not like it!
Amanda: Excellent. Well, inside the Met museum if you know, it's like a big open airy marble lobby, there's often a very elaborate floral arrangement right on top of the entrance desk. Today it is wine and grape stuff of all kinds. So there are like the leaves of the grape vines. There are green vines actually all over the ceiling, making like a bower of vines, it’s very beautiful. And then there's grapes just ALL OVER. There's grapes on like every surface. Real grapes that you could…you could eat if you wanted to.
Brandon: What?
Amanda: Anyone distracted by these grapes.
Brandon: I’m a little distracted by these grapes.
Amanda: Yeah, mhm.
Lauren: I want to run on them, I want to crush them.
Eric: I would also like to eat them. But only, not because I have a thing about it, but I just kind of want to be involved with my cousins.
[Lauren giggles]
Brandon: I just want to taste them.
Amanda: Excellent, excellent.
Eric: [quietly] Just a…little taste. A little taste.
Amanda: Well, I’ll tell you some options available to you. So when you walk in, you can go straight ahead, up a grand staircase into an area of some paintings. To the left, there is a Greek Hall of sculpture and pottery. And to the right is the Egyptian wing with a lot of mummies. And helpfully they sort of themed these grapes to the art that's around.
So straight ahead, that's just straightforward. You go up more stairs, take some photos, that's where the dinner will eventually be. To the right, they're all raisins and they get more and more shriveled as you go in because it's Egyptian and it's very old art, ya get it?
[Brandon chuckles]
And then to the left there just luscious grapes and actually little cups of wine, just little Dixie cups, all over the place. Because this is where the Greek art is. This is a Greek themed Met Gala, so they have really festooned the area to the left.
[Eric grunts in understanding]
Amanda: Where would you like to go?
Ga-Ga is going to go sort of around to the staircase to the bathrooms back there to get her costume change on.
Lauren: Hmm.
Brandon: Part of my occultism is a belief that if I ingest art…
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: I become art.
Amanda: Okay. So let's say that is true.
Brandon: I [chuckles] would like to eat some art. So I want to go into like the Greek, with it…is it just pottery or is there more stuff in there?
Amanda: It's statues, pottery, and then some jewelry in cases.
Brandon: I think if I eat enough statues, I'll become a better looking goat.
Amanda: Okay, okay.
Eric: Interesting. Bold play.
Amanda: Great. There's also a lot of paper artifacts back there. Maybe you smell paper?
[Brandon gasps in awe]
Smells a little bit like something you want to eat?
Brandon: Definitely.
Amanda: So, um…
Brandon: Any tin cans?
Amanda: There are some tin pottery, yes there is!
Brandon: [excitedly] Oh!!
Amanda: Excellent.
Lauren: Intriguing.
Amanda: Excellent! So, Cup, you're going to be walking over to the left. Where would the rest of you like to go?
Lauren: I…I’ve spent, you know, most of my life outside running around the hills. It's gotten a little bit boring. These stairs are very exciting to me.
Amanda: Great.
Lauren: And I'm intrigued to see if maybe this will bring back a little bit of my zest for life. So I really want to run up those stairs.
Amanda: Okay!
Lauren: Just clump all over them.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: Where are the most amount of people going to be? Because I need to see and be seen.
Amanda: Yeah, so right now they're being held at the top of the stairs. There's like a bunch of painting galleries and they're gonna have cocktails in there. And then they'll be brought through the Egyptian wing to the Temple of Dendur, which is where the actual dinner is going to happen later in the night.
Eric: Oh, interesting.
Brandon: Is that, like, the actual Met area?
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Is that what it’s called?
Amanda: It sure is.
Brandon: This is very good.
Amanda: Sure is. I have a floor map for the Museum of Art in front of me. So, If you really want to know, the dinner will be happening in gallery, excuse me [short pause] 131.
[Brandon laughs]
Lauren: This is all setting up for us to go and rob the Met later, right? That's what this leaning to?
Amanda: There's something…something secret going on that you don't really know about.
Eric: Mm. I think I want to try and go with everyone I want to see if my beloved Bilomena is around. So I'm going to go up the stairs with…with Daisy.
Amanda: Okay, so Montgomery and Daisy, you're going to start making way up the stairs. It too is sort of embowered in vines, with grapes hanging from the ceiling.
So you've heard three options here, you can run all the way up the stairs like just up the middle, all the people, all the photographers, all the folks.
You can run on the outsides of the stairs where the vines are anchored and kind of weave your way in between, behind, maybe climb the vines, whatever you want.
Or third, you can remember that there's an elevator and use that instead.
[Lauren chuckles]
Eric: Oh, interesting.
Lauren: I definitely want to weave through the vines because that sounds exciting.
Amanda: Cool.
Lauren: Yeah.
Amanda: Why don't you please roll four d6 for me since you’re using your smallness.
Lauren: [excitedly whispers] Excellent.
[dice shake and roll]
Oh! Three successes.
Amanda: Excellent. Eric, please give me four d6 since you are pursuing your aim and also doing a thing.
[dice shake and roll]
Eric: Okay. Three successes as well.
Amanda: Great, so you both are making great progress. We will leave you as you bob and weave your way up those stairs. Check in with you and your spiritual crisis, Lauren, in a few minutes.
Brandon let's follow Cup into the Greek sculpture wing. As you walk in, there are sculptures that are on pedestals about four feet high. And then if you peel off into the side rooms, there are glass cases with a bunch of artifacts in them like paper, like tin, like gold. There’s jewelry, there's some, you know, pottery. There's all kinds of stuff.
And then in the very back are some giant statues that are sitting on the floor that you could very easily lick at…little goat level.
Brandon: Part of my belief system is alchemy, for sure, because of the course…
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: [laughs] Hold on, I need to write down all the things that you’re talking about right now.
Brandon: I’m only inventing a religion as we go here. And it’s not great.
Eric: [chuckling throughout] If I eat art, I become art and alchemy equals…yes!
Brandon: [giggles] So I'm going to go up to the tastiest looking glass exhibit.
Amanda: What kind of mineral or, thing is tastiest for you?
Brandon: I’m looking for that high dollar stuff.
Amanda: Oh!
Brandon: That silver, that titanium, that gold, that, like, paper that's a billion years old? That's worth as much as gold. And I'm going to say a few words in Latin. Um…
Amanda: Lorem ipsum…
Well, luckily, just a few feet into this wing, there is a room immediately to your left with a lot of really pretty gold jewelry, and even some gold forks.
[Brandon makes sounds of interest]
You could eat gold with gold if you really wanted to.
Brandon: I’m going to eat the fork!
Amanda: Well, there is a glass case in your way. So…so what would you like to do?
Brandon: Yeah, I'm going to say a few Latin phrases.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, very good.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: And then I'm gonna headbutt that glass case…
Amanda: Okay!
Brandon: Break it open. Give me some of that gold!
Amanda: Would you please roll 4 d6 for me?
[dice roll]
Brandon: Three successes!
Amanda: Okay. You do actually make a crack in this glass case. I think one more headbutt would open it up. But! You also see someone from the shadows, in like a dark suit, not a black suit like the staffers, but like a like a very kind of dark gray suit, walk over to you. And they sort of have their eyes off to the distance, they’re not looking at you directly and they say…
Amanda (as Dark Suit Man): Oh, are you…are you one of us?
Brandon: Hm…
Amanda (as Dark Suit Man): How's the… how's the weather? How's the weather outside?
Brandon: I’m going to….
Eric: How severe are their bangs?
Amanda: No bangs, buzzcut.
Eric: Nice, nice, nice.
Amanda: Earpiece though. Not like the earpieces you saw with the sort of headset with a little mouth thing, Just the, sort of, secret service earpiece.
Brandon: Right. I am going to…take a chance here.
Amanda: Mhm.
Brandon: And just like tap twice with my hoof on the floor as if I'm signaling ‘Yes’.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: Okay. The man nods and says,
Amanda (as Dark Suit Man): Okay, very well. What is the new passphrase?
[Eric snorts, laughing]
What…What did you say before? I didn't hear this, dang earpiece. I don't know if yours is falling out too, but it's the worst.
Brandon: I’m going to…[chuckles] Fuck. I’m going to get found out immediately.
Amanda: You can say Lorem ipsum.
Brandon: I’m…that's true. I am going to go up to this man. I can't resist the temptation here. I'm going to both fix his earpiece for him, but by licking it, [slowly] pushing it back into his ear. As a gesture of goodwill.
Amanda: Two d6.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: [exhales] Uh, no successes.
[Lauren and Eric laugh]
Amanda: Okay. Adding to the chaos pool here.
Eric: If only! If only there was a way to communicate with this man!
[dice rolls while Eric speaks]
Wouldn’t you know Latin? If only there was a way to get through to him!
Brandon: My Latin is in bleats, it’s not in English!
[everyone chuckles]
Amanda: That’s true.
Lauren: It’s goat Latin.
Eric: That’s a deep burn.
Brandon: No one can speak Latin!
[Lauren chuckles]
Amanda: Well, unfortunately, the chaos pool had two successes and you had none. So, the man recoils and looks down at you and sees in fact that you are a goat. And you see him try to touch his earpiece to send a message, but you've actually short circuited it with your lick. So, he is definitely suspicious and is going to try to come at you and grab you. So, uh…what would you like to do? Maybe run?
Brandon: Well…one, first thing, did that taste good? Good earpiece taste?
Amanda: No, I mean little salty, so maybe tasted good to a goat. But otherwise…
Lauren: How’d you even get up there? To his ear?
Amanda: Just a jump.
Brandon: Yeah, it’s a good jump.
Amanda: Goats love to jump.
Brandon: I think it’s too early to try to summon a demon to defend me.
[Lauren laughs]
So, yeah, I'm gonna I'm just gonna run away quickly.
Amanda: Okay, that's return to Montgomery and Daisy. You have made it halfway upstairs, lots of people again posing for pictures. Staffers hanging out with their iPhones, good guys. Exiting again, the shepherds are still around her, but you could see her more in the center. And she's dressed as one grape. She's actually in, like, a like a sort of like oompa-loompa style, Violet Beauregard purple bubble. And she's just walking like a hamster, out the front doors.
Eric: I turned to Daisy, and say,
Eric (as Montgomery):You know, it’s a critique of capitalism.
Lauren: I don't get it.
Eric (as Montgomery):I don’t think we’re supposed to.
[Lauren chuckles]
Amanda: Excellent. So you have actually made it to the top of the stairs, and you are able to continue forward into the American and European painting wing. Which is where people are having cocktails looking at, you know, Monet as you will...
Or you can peel off and walk around a mezzanine, that sort of circles the entire lobby. So you can look down on people entering, you can see a little bit into the Greek wing, you can see the flower arrangements. What would you like to do?
Eric: I think I want to go to the mezzanine to see what's going on. Because I don't think I've seen anyone whose net…net worth has exceeded 1 billion yet.
Amanda: Mhm, Okay, great.
Lauren: I want to go deeper into the party, you know, find sort of like, the end point to get a goodie bag.
Amanda: Excellent. So, uh…
Eric: [mischievously] The party has no end! It goes on forever.
[Lauren laughs]
It extends like the slow march of time.
Amanda: Like history. So, Daisy, you are entering forward into gallery 600, for those playing along at home with your Met floor map.
[Eric and Lauren laugh heartily]
Lots of people, there's sort of like a bunch of different squares of galleries. You can kind of go around in a circle. People are milling around. There are waiters with cups of wine.
And in the middle of this first room, is a table with little bags on it.
[Lauren mms in interest]
You're not quite sure what's in them. But people are grabbing them, looking inside, and smiling.
[Lauren gasps]
Brandon: Smaller goats!
[Lauren laughs]
Amanda: Small packs you hold in your mouth, actually, if you wanted to.
Lauren: I want to! I very much want to.
Amanda: Okay, great. So what’s your plan here?
Lauren: How far is the….you know what, I’m just going to run towards it. I'm just going towards it.
Amanda: Yeah, it's like 20 feet into the room, right in the middle of the room.
Lauren: Great.
Amanda: Any particular strategy here, or just like…like a bullet?
Lauren: I'm going to run around the edge of the room, you know, trying to sort of stay out of the…out of the way. And then sort of come in toward the table from the side.
Brandon: [chuckling] What’s more suspicious? A goat running directly toward the middle of a room or a goat running along the border of a room?
Eric: I like the goat doing the end-around.
Brandon: I’m like, alright, this goat knows!
Eric: This goat went to the University of Georgia to play running back!
[Lauren and Brandon chuckle]
Amanda: If you would please roll two d6 for me, let's see how you do.
[dice roll]
Amanda: You are small, but you are also not pink, so I think that negates the sneakiness factor.
Lauren: One success.
Amanda: Okay, one success. A couple of people sort of turn their heads after you pass them and look behind them, but they don't see you. So you are able to make it over to that table.
Problem is, is it’s a cocktail table. So, it's about five feet high. What would you like to do?
Lauren: Is there anything around it?
Amanda: There's a tablecloth.
Lauren: Okay,
Amanda: That you could pull.
Lauren: Yep.
Amanda: There are a couple of people sitting down on benches, not quite nearby. So you can’t step up on the bench and then up on the table. But you could if you wanted to, do like an imagine, like Spider Man going up like on the building?
Lauren: Parkour?
Amanda: Yeah, you could kind of parkour your way onto that table.
Lauren: Okay, I'm going to go under the table.
Amanda: Yep.
Lauren: And with my teeth, grab the tablecloth from the inside of the table and yank it down.
Amanda: Oh, very good, very good. Two d6 please.
[dice roll]
Lauren: Two successes!
Amanda: Woooo. Let's see what chaos has to say.
[dice roll]
Also two successes.
Lauren: Woo…
So, unfortunately, because my successes cancel out your successes, things are going to go a little bit south. And when you pull on that tablecloth instead of just like one or two of the bags falling down. The whole table actually tips over. It wasn't very well set up. So the table tips over, the tablecloth goes with it. And people look over to see a tipped over table and then where the table used to be a small pink goat.
[Eric giggles]
Amanda: We're adding a die to the chaos pool here.
Eric: Oh yeah?
Brandon: Now, what if you just pose, like…like that was intentional? Like that was part of the…
Lauren: Well yeah, I'm gonna…Is there anybody wearing pink around me?
Amanda: Uh, there is someone wearing pink and she's actually the first person to clap.
Lauren: Great!
Amanda: And runs over and tries to grab you. It's Kristen Bell.
[Lauren gasps in excitement]
And she is extraordinarily excited by tiny animals, much like a sloth.
Lauren: This could not be going better.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Yeah.
Lauren: She tries to grab me?
Amanda: Yes, she tries to grab you.
Lauren: I happily go into her arms.
Amanda: Yep. So she is going to cry. Dax Shepherd Is there.
[Everyone laughing]
[enunciating with enthusiasm] She is taking a video on Instagram of herself laughing and crying and grabbing it and yelling and seeing if Ellen is hidden somewhere, having set up the surprise for her!
And she is just nuzzling you.
Lauren: I nuzzle back!
Amanda: Well, she's going to be carrying you around for the whole party. Um…
Lauren: Hm…
Amanda: Unless things change a little bit. So why don't we check in with our friend, Cup?
Brandon: It me!
Amanda: Where are you running Cup?
Brandon: So can I smell any cake? Any flour? Any baked good? Or is there anyone with like a very tall chef's hat I see?
Amanda: Mhm.
Brandon: I'm running through all these exhibits…
[Eric chuckles]
Amanda: Well, you sure do. There was just a plume of this wonderful like puffed pastry smell…?
Brandon: Mm.
Amanda: That came from the top of the stairs. You heard a loud crash, whatever, but then there was a plume of puffed pastry. So that is where the best smell accessible to you right now is.
Brandon: I’m going to immediately go that way.
Amanda: Great. Up the same stairs as before…are you going to run up the middle? Are you going to run up the vines? Sort of like on the side of the stairs? There is also an elevator if you're able to figure out how elevators work and reach the button.
[Lauren and Eric giggle]
Brandon: Is there anyone still on the stairs? Or is it just an empty staircase?
Amanda: It has started to mellow out a little bit, so most of the people have arrived. The top gallery is extremely crowded. People are trying to now see what Kristen Bell is carrying and take selfies with not just her, but her goat. She has a pink power suit, by the way.
Lauren: So amazing.
Amanda: And the staff are beginning to filter down the stairs into the Egyptian wing where dinner is going to be served, so pretty empty actually.
Brandon: Is there anyone who's like in a…costume that's like demon-esque? Or like, god-esque or anything that would look like they could have a goat next to them?
Amanda: Yes! There is someone who is actually dressed like Satan.
Brandon: Convenient.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Someone did not understand the theme.
Brandon: MY LORD!!!
[everyone chuckles]
Amanda: They are ethereal. They are willowy. They are extremely tall but seem not to have any kind of platform shoe on. They have a cape behind them, that is netted out of what seems like darkness itself. And when you kind of run alongside them and turn around you see it’s Tilda Swinton?
Lauren: I was about to ask, is it Tilda Swinton?
Amanda: It sure is!
Eric: I was hoping it wasn't Jared Leto, and you DID NOT disappoint.
Amanda: Yeah, dressed so convincingly, like some people are actually getting out of the way because it's extremely scary.
Brandon: Okay! Well, I immediately think it is Satan.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: And so I do worship them. I immediately bolt up to them. And I lick their feet, and try to get them clean, and I bleat at them.
Amanda: Uh huh.
Brandon: And I, wait for instruction. I'm actually, you know, maybe hopefully like licking their feet will make them go up the stairs and then I can follow them?
Amanda: Okay, Tilda Swinton as Satan crouches down, looks deep in your eyes…
[Brandon makes a short bleating sound]
With one little finger under your goat chin. And then touches her forehead to yours. Continues up the stairs.
Brandon: Do I receive a divine message?
Amanda: What do you glean from the depths of her eyes?
Eric: [laughing] It’s like Cup got an email in his brain. It goes, ‘ding, ding!’
[Lauren and Amanda chuckle]
Amanda: What message do you take from Tilda, as Satan, your overlord?
Brandon: Well, as our foreheads come together, I hopefully mindmeld, and I ask the question, ‘Where's the cake?’. Do I receive a response?
Amanda: Why don’t you roll four d6, please?
[dice roll]
Brandon: Three successes.
Amanda: I also got three successes. Unfortunately, this situation is going south. Tilda is straightening up, looks back down at you again and senses somehow that you are not fully devoted to the dark.
[Eric chuckles]
Brandon: [exclaims] OH NO!!!
[Eric continues laughing]
Amanda: So, she turns around trying to signal for somebody to come figure out why this goat is here. But everybody is so scared that they have in fact run away from her. So, she sort of like peels off and tries to like float.
Again! You are not sure her feet are touching the ground at all, tries to float off to find somebody leaving the stairs actually, free for your escape. She is, however, trying to alert somebody that goats are here.
Brandon: Yeah, I take the opportunity. Like, obviously, she would have a goat maybe as a prop and then maybe the goat got scared so maybe the goat runs away in fear and runs up the stairs!
Amanda: Okay, in fact you do. And you run into the first room right off the top of the stairs. Where Daisy has upended a table filled of little tiny pastry bags, so they are not the gift bags. They are gift bags filled with little pastries, because on your walk from the gallery down to dinner, people don't want you to get hungry. And so they have little tiny bags that look like little wine baskets. Little, you know, grape baskets for the harvest filled with little tiny pastries. So as you assess the situation, overwhelmed by just so many sense of pastries, and may or may not notice Daisy in the arms of America's hero Kristen Bell, we check back in with Montgomery.
So Montgomery, you are in a mezzanine. Conveniently, the railings are sort of like a fence railing, so you can see in between them. It's not like a solid marble wall. So you look into the lobby where you see people walking into the dining wing via the Egyptian wing. You see staffers going off into the back, kinda to deal with catering and logistics. People are starting to, you know, cease the flow in from outside. And you see your new companion, Heathcliff, running across the lobby communing with Tilda Swinton somehow and then running up the stairs.
Eric (as Montgomery): [pensively] Some people have all the luck…
[Lauren chuckles]
I hope I’ll find my beloved someday, maybe someone who has investments in both stocks and bonds and be able to take care of me and my old good age and I'll be able to reclaim…
Brandon: My old goat age of 4?
[Lauren giggles]
Eric (as Montgomery): Maybe want to turn 5, maybe 6? Go out to pasture?
Amanda: Mhm.
Eric (as Montgomery):And I'll be able to reclaim the Abernathy name. If only somebody would walk in the door, [short pause, as if summoning] NOW.
Amanda: Michael Bloomberg walks in.
[Eric laughs with gusto]
Don’t know if he’s your type, but he is a billionaire and you know that where one billionaire is, other billionaires follow. So, he is walking directly into the Egyptian wing. No time for cocktails and canapé …..as Mr. Bloomberg, no he does not. So he is walking through the Egyptian wing, past the mummies, and you see him make a left hand turn where dinner is going to be.
Eric: [laughs] Like a murder of billionaires.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: I'm gonna go follow.
Eric: [intriguingly] Get it? Get it?!? Capitalism is a murder!!
Uh…I’m gonna…I’m going to run down the stairs and try to tail after former Mayor Bloomberg.
Amanda: Please roll two d6 for me.
[dice roll]
Eric: Okay, you know, I need this.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: And to get in with a good crowd, I need I think that everyone else has had fun messing with celebrities and I think that I need to harness the chaos that has happened. So, while Kristen Bell is holding Daisy up in the air and while Tilda Swinton is communing with the satanic goat, I'm gonna take the chaos dice and I'm gonna roll them.
Amanda: Great.
Eric: So I got six d6.
Amanda: So you are partying hard.
Lauren: Yeah!
Amanda: You take the chaos for yourself!
Brandon: [chanting] Party hard! Party hard! Party hard!
[dice roll]
Eric (as Montgomery):I am chaos incarnate!
[Eric laughs in reaction to roll]
Amanda: There are three successes.
Eric: Three successes.
Amanda: Unopposed, no failures. So things go swimmingly well, tell me what happens.
Eric: Okay, so I think that I bound down the stairs, and I think everybody's too busy taking photos of Daisy or of Tilda…
Amanda: Oh no, there’s no photos of Tilda. You just take one and it’s just all black.
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: People keep trying hard-resetting their phones, so they don't see me run by and as I'll dash through the mummy way.
Amanda: Okay, great. Well, you are able to stay right on the heels of a former Mayor Michael Bloomberg. And you walk with him into the Temple of Dendur. It's a beautiful open room, might have seen in the hit film Ocean’s 8. There are…there is a glass, skylights…
Brandon: Is that the one with the goats?
Amanda: That’s the other one.
Brandon: Gotcha.
Eric: That’s the one with Awkwafina in it.
Amanda: No goats, does have Rihanna.
[Eric and Brandon lightly laugh]
There are beautiful banquet tables set up. There is an altar of gift bags set up in the back of the room on the actual altar of the Temple of Dendur. Beautiful lighting. There’s servers setting up and a few people are beginning to make their way in. This is kind of like preboarding on an airplane where the billionaire's get to go in first. So, Bloomberg is there talking, actually, to a member of the Tartar family. You can tell because she's wearing tartan.
Eric: Of course.
[Lauren laughs]
That’s a good pun!
Amanda: You can’t tell if it is her family colors or if it is a play on a picnic blanket.
Eric: Sure. And also all the Tartars look exactly the same. They all have the same color hair, which is white! And they all dress the same which is in all white.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: And they all have the same shoes, which are Nike Air Maxes.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: Black on black surprisingly. Um, so I don't know which member of the Tartar family this is. Can I get a better look?
Amanda: You can. So the way this is laid out, is when you walk into the room, right in front of you, there is like a beautiful kind of water feature, resembling a river. You have to go all the way around the left to go up some stairs into the main area of the room.
Or, you can if you wish, do a kind of like little puddle jumping situation because there are rocks in the water feature, and you could jump across it and right up onto the…the dining area if you wanted to.
Eric: If only! If only my heart desired, and I did, in fact, want to do that. [whispers] I wish I could do something else. Yeah, I think I'm going to do that.
That sounds good.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: It's not my forte but I think that jumping from thing to thing is definitely something I can do as a goat.
Amanda: Great, please roll four d6.
Eric (as Montgomery): Cuz I'm pursuing my true love! And by love, I mean mutual bonds!
[dice roll, Lauren and Amanda chuckle in response]
Eric: Two successes.
Amanda: Okay, well this is quite conspicuous. So, I'm going to add one die back into the chaos pool for your colleagues, but in this case, you make it across. You are able to jump onto the area where all the tables are, quite near to where Anne Hathaway famously almost barfed on the table if you remember the hit film, Ocean’s 8.
[Lauren chuckles]
Brandon: That is the one with the goats?
Amanda: That is the one with Cate Blanchett wearing a lot of gay tuxes.
Brandon: Right.
Amanda: Yeah, mhm.
Eric: So wait, is that the one with Eugene Levy and the goats?
Amanda: Uh, no. That was actually Brad Pitt. People confuse him for a goat all the time.
[Brandon and Lauren laugh]
Similar hairstyle. Uh, so you make it up on the dais, and you see it is Bilomena! Oh my goodness! Your true love is right there next to Daisy’s true love…the gift bag.
[Eric guffaws]
Surrounded by Heathcliff ‘Cup’ Cupcake III’s true love…stuff to lick!
[Brandon gasps in response]
Lauren: Oh my goodness. The treasure trove!
Brandon: [giddy] And everything is lickable!
Amanda: Sure, sure.
Eric: I feel like this is the point in like a 2010s romantic comedy when Lizzo starts playing.
Amanda: Yeah, definitely, to be reprised later in the credits.
Eric: Exactly! Cuz I'm 100% that goat.
Amanda: You sure are.
[everyone laughs]
You sure are. Speaking of which, your colleagues, your partners in crime, upstairs are actually moving toward you, as the museum staff ushers everybody into the dining room. They send Ms. Kristen Bell with Dax Shepherd somewhere behind her, less important, follow…you know they have her go into the dining room first since where she goes with the goat in her arms, people will follow.
So Daisy, you have escaped suspicion and that people think you're supposed to be there. But you are currently in Kristen Bell’s arms forever and ever-Amen. What is your plan here to get out?
Lauren: And now we are in the dining hall? So I've completely missed the little goody bags and the cocktail hour?
Amanda: So Kristen has one over her wrist, so…
Lauren: She does?!
Amanda: It fills… it’s not a goody bag. It is just a little kind of appetizer basket. So it's filled with pastries and Cup, you were also able to either eat a couple pastries or lick a lot of them? But you have that opportunity.
Brandon: That's the hardest choice!
Amanda: Yeah. Which…which one are you going to go with? With your heart?
Brandon: Oh, well, I've got it. I gotta save room for the cake.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: So I'm gonna do a bunch of licks.
Amanda: Okay, great.
Lauren: See, I want as many goody bags…bags with things in them as possible.
Amanda: Yeah, that’s true.
Lauren: I wanna, I want to get this bag off of Kristen Bell’s arm.
Amanda: Okay.
Lauren: I'm still in her arm, so I'm gonna kind of like snuggle in closer to her and like nuzzle my head…
Amanda: She loves it, she's crying.
Lauren: Oh!
Amanda: Makeup is gone.
Lauren: I'm hoping that that you know, the tears will blur her eyesight so she can't really see what I'm doing.
Amanda: I think that’s fair, I think that’s fair.
Eric: She never had any makeup, it was never there.
[Brandon chuckles]
Lauren: She's looks like that. And I'm going to nuzzle my head against her arm and try to like, put my small little neck through the loop of the basket, and get it around my neck.
Amanda: Smart! If you would please roll four d6, since you are pursuing your dream.
[dice roll]
Lauren: Two successes.
Amanda: Okay, well, that goes against the chaos pool’s one failure…
Lauren: [quietly] Yessss!
Amanda: So you are able to get that goodie bag over your neck.
Lauren: Oh, finally!
Amanda: Kristen actually pauses about to walk into the Temple of Dendur’s room is because she realized that she has to go touch up her makeup and also to finish posting to Instagram. Um, so, she pauses a little bit next to a long table with some canapés on it. People are kind of talking and milling around, she’s a little bit confused. If you want to jump, this would be a good time.
Lauren: Yes. I'm going to jump out of her arms and scurry underneath the table so I can hide and enjoy my goodie bag.
Amanda: Awesome, Cup, you are standing right next to the overturned table. Daisy is up in Kristen's arms. People are milling around, looking at her, trying to get in some pets and the goody bags are all over the floor, pastries are underfoot. And people are really quite distracted.
Brandon: Cool. Yeah, I lick a pastry, I lick a foot. I lick a pastry, I lick a foot.
[Lauren giggles]
Amanda: Okay, If you could please roll two d6 for me.
[dice roll]
Brandon: One success.
Amanda: Great! Chaos pool did not reign supreme here. So you are able to get in a few good licks. And then you see that Kristen with Daisy in her arms, begins to walk away. The staff are sort of ushering everybody downstairs to the Temple of Dendur for dinner. What would you like to do?
Brandon: Do I smell or see any cake?
Amanda: There is! I'm not sure how good your nose is, but there is a whiff of cake that’s coming from down in the dinner area. Because the cake has been set up downstairs and as dinner is being served they want to like, you know, look at it. Take a bunch of photos…looks exactly like a pile of grapes. Looks like that's Fruit of the Loom guy. Like gigantic grapes!! I don't know why they did it that way. But they're all spherical cakes.
And Ga-Ga is actually a little bit upset because they look just like her second costume.
Lauren: Oh no!
Eric: BuzzFeed article, BuzzFeed article the next day. It’s not good. Is this photo Lady Ga-Ga or a cake of grapes?
[Lauren and Amanda laugh quietly]
It’s both!
Brandon: Okay, here’s what…
Lauren: She's in the cake! It’s her third costume!
Eric: She is the cake!
Brandon: Here’s what I’m going to do. So, there was a tablecloth on the table, right?
Amanda: There was, yes. Now it's kind of crumpled next to the pile of small bags.
Brandon: Perfect. So I'm going to go up to the tablecloth. I'm going to chew a little hole through it.
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: A big enough hole for my head.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: And I’m going to put it over my head.
Amanda: Great.
Brandon: And then I'm going to walk confidently into the dining hall…
[Lauren laughs]
And amble up to the pile of grapes and sit next to it as if planted there, as if part of the design
Amanda: Okay this is incredibly conspicuous…
[Lauren and Eric laugh]
So I’m adding a second die to the chaos pool. Please roll four d6 since you are pursuing your goal.
Brandon: Now If I pray to my Lord as I do so, can I do six d6?
Amanda: [hesitantly] You can do that…
Brandon: Tilda Swinton?
Amanda: You are going to though, blow up your spot. So I think this will qualify as partying hard if you want to like party the hardest, aka communing with your satanic overlord, you may.
Brandon: I do want to do that. I do want to pray to Tilda Swinton, to give me safe passage into the promised land.
[Eric chuckles]
Excellent.
Amanda: So you're able to roll six d6 plus the two that were in the chaos pool.
[dice roll]
Eric: [chanting] Eight d6! Eight d6! Eight d6!
[Hear scraping of some die]
Brandon: Four successes.
Amanda: Oh, so exciting! Folks. somehow think that this is indeed an art piece, this is some kind of metaphor for temptation or something… or letting yourself go. Maybe it's a discarded tunic from somebody who decided just to really just roll with the Bacchanalia theme here. Lot of skin, by the way. A lot of skin at the Met Gala.
So you make it successfully into the Temple of Dendur. You were able to go up onto the sort of dais area next to where the Temple begins. And the cake and the gift bags are actually on either side of the archway leading into the Temple, as a sort of dual like end of the night, little reward there.
Eric: As Cup walks by, he runs by Jay Z, and he's like,
Eric (as Jay-Z): Haha, it’s a metaphor! Oh…F!
Eric: That was for me. I just wanted to…
[Amanda and Lauren laugh]
I just needed a little bit.
Amanda: Okay, okay.
Brandon: Now, I’m no goat fool. So I'm not gonna just start eating this cake.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: We gotta wait.
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: So I'm going to thank my Lord Tilda Swinton, sit down next to the cake, lay my head down and also pray for the courage to not eat the cake.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: Until the opportune moment.
Amanda: That's excellent. A lot of self-control there. I really appreciate it.
Eric: Can I meet up with Cup?
Amanda: Uh, you sure can. Because you notice suddenly that everybody's attention is somewhere else? And you look and sort of at the very front corner of the room, Anna Wintour is standing up and beginning to give and address a toast, thanking everybody for coming, This ostensibly for charity?
Eric: She says that too, which is...
Brandon: Weird? And she waits every time she says it, which is weird.
Eric: But it’s behind her sunglasses, so you don’t even know.
Amanda: Yeah, and I think now you all understand why she wears sunglasses so often because every light in the room including people's flashlights on their phones, turns to her. So the rest of the room is quite dark, giving you good cover to run, if you want, under the tables through people's feet over to where the rest of the group is.
Eric: Yeah, I'm a little jealous. I see Belomina spending too much time talking to a former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and I get jealous. So I just want to do like a…like a drive by headbutt to former Mayor, former Mayor and noted centrist Michael Bloomberg. [chuckling] Is that okay?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Okay, cool.
[dice roll]
Amanda: Please, four d6.
Eric: I got two successes.
Amanda: Great. you succeed. Where do you headbutt him?
Eric: Just in the shins.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: He's rather small and he's a frail Jewish man.
Amanda: He is.
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: Yeah, I nailed him.
Amanda: I’m not sure if Judaism is relevant to this, uh, moment. But yes.
Eric: [laughing] Listen, I'm sharing the three things people know about noted centrist and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Amanda: It’s true. He also sometimes takes the subway.
Eric: [still laughing] He has! He invented the Bloomberg Terminal.
Amanda: So you are able, in fact, to headbutt Michael Bloomberg. He says “Ow!” and Anna Wintour, you feel her eyes actually like laser beams FOCUS on former Mayor Michael Bloomberg who though his net worth is larger than hers, his social stature is not! So everyone kind of like looks over and grumbles and then turn their attention back to Anna. So, this is some seismic social waves have just occurred here.
Eric: Ha! Everyone grumbles like [quietly], Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Brandon: Noted centrist, noted centrist!
Eric: Oh man. I heard that if there are no good Democrats running he's just gonna run on an independent ticket. That’s what I heard.
Amanda: Bilomena though, giggles a little bit.
[Eric gasps]
And only because you're right next to her do you hear it? But she does do a little chortle. she appreciates a good physical gag. And then she like everybody…
Eric: [guffaws] Noted physical comedy fan.
Lauren and Amanda together: Philomena Tartar.
Amanda: Yes, and then turns her attention back to Anna. So you're able to run over to the cake and the goody bags, it is quiet back here, it is a little bit darker. Everyone is sort of across the dais from you. So, what would the three of you like to do?
Lauren: I am still under a different table, correct? Not under the…
Amanda: You are, you are at the entrance to this room under a sort of sideboard of canapes on it. Is this the moment that you would like to run toward the gift bags?
Lauren: Yeah. So I think I've had my head in the little goodie basket around my neck, like, you know, feeding bag? And I’ve just been eating all these pastries.
Amanda: Excellent.
Lauren: And now…
Amanda and Brandon together: The dream!
Lauren: I've reached the end of the goody bag, and I want more, and I look up. And I finally see this table.
[Amanda gasps]
And I know it's Cup sitting there. And so I'm going to…I'm going to run over and I'm going to take the cover of darkness and the fact that I am little, and just…just run as fast as I possibly can to underneath the gift table, kind of like a cover to cover type thing.
Amanda: Great. You're able to do that. And actually, as you leave that sideboard area, you hear somebody else whispering,
Amanda (as Whispering Voice): Oh, is that…is that the best offer you can make? Really? That's really what you're going to come in here with?! [semi-agitated] Really man?!
Amanda: You see these two men whispering to each other. One of them is a man in a gray suit with an earpiece. The other one is in a navy suit. And they are whispering furiously to each other as Anna Wintour is speaking in the other room. So you don't necessarily need to talk to them. But you notice that as soon as you walk out.
Lauren: Yeah, Lauren is intrigued, but Daisy is focused. She wants the goody bag.
Eric: Lauren needs to blow up these two men’s spot but Daisy has more important things on her mind.
Lauren: She needs some goodies!
Amanda: Great. So you are going to go to under the gift bag table?
Lauren: Yes.
Amanda: Awesome, Cup. You're under cake table.
Brandon: I was very protective. I did not know which direction she was coming towards. So I did get very scared for a second.
Amanda: Okay. Are you all right now though?
Brandon: Yes, I'm okay.
Amanda: Did you bleat out of fear at all?
Brandon: No.
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: I'm very stoic under pressure.
[Lauren chuckles]
Eric: He was about to open his mouth, Montgomery puts a hoof over his mouth.
[Lauren continues laughing]
Brandon: And then faints.
Eric: No, I’ve been holding it, he has not been excited yet. I'm holding it together.
Amanda: So Montgomery, you are also underneath the cake table?
Eric: Yes, I'm with Cup.
Brandon: I squint my eyes at them, and I’m like if you even try, either of you.
Eric (as Montgomery): Oh, oh, dear boy. I've already found the object of my affection. And I'll tell you one thing…I'll tell you one thing. It's not former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Lauren: Unless those cakes are filled with more cakes, I don't care. I want a thing that has more things inside of it.
Eric: [laughing] You don’t even know what’s in it, it’s just the…
Lauren: It’s the construct!
Eric: The idea of a goody bag. You get to have fun!? And then there’s this thing that has all of these things in it? You get to take that home with you!
Lauren: Yeah!
Eric: It’s great!
Lauren: [escalating in pitch] And I want ALL OF THEM. I don’t care, I WANT ALL OF THEM.
Amanda: Are able to resist this temptation Daisy? Are you going to grab a gift bag off of the table?
Lauren: My plan is to go from under one table to under another table. But I think as I approach the goody bag table, I just get so excited. And I'm running so fast that I'm rediscovering my love for running.
Amanda: So small!
Lauren: I'm so small and my legs are moving. They're so tiny!
Amanda: So quick!
Lauren: And I just I want to jump to the on top of the table and just try to leap over it and grab one of the bags as I go with my teeth.
Amanda: A little swan dive.
Lauren: A little swan dive right over it. Just so I can get behind the table and get a little investigation going on about what's in this goody bag. So I can see how many I want.
Amanda: Gotcha. So just reconnaissance here not any grabbing?
Lauren: Just reconnaissance, but I want to pull one as I do that, because I want to take all the goody bags and I want to make sure it's worth it.
Amanda: Yeah, very important.
Lauren: And also to see how heavy they are.
Amanda: Good. Please roll four d6 for me since you are pursuing your highest goal.
[dice roll]
Lauren: Two successes.
Amanda: Okay, excellent. Let’s see, chaos pool…
[dice roll]
Doesn't have any successes for me. So, you are able to succeed. You elegantly, and so tinyly, jump over that table. And you observe that most of the gift bags have this little white kind of paper on top. You see some designer lipstick, they have iPads, there is a voucher for a drone?
Lauren: Hm…
Eric: It’s handwritten from Elon Musk too.
[Lauren laughing]
It’s says, ‘One drone, on me. Love Elon’.
Lauren: Must be my friend to receive.
Amanda: But in one of them, you see a vial of this very glowy green neon substance…
Lauren: Mm
Amanda: In like a glass vial just in a gift bag. And it's sort of like three or four rows in, like it's not on the edge. But it's in there and you grab one next to it so you grab a normal gift bag people go through. But you also see this really very scary and toxic looking substance.
Lauren: Okay, well I eat the paper from the gift bag that I got.
Amanda: Smart.
Lauren: Some normal snacky.
Amanda: Good start.
Lauren: Um, I love to eat things!
Brandon (as Cup): [gruffly] Hey! Hey! Heyy! Gimme that!
Eric: You don't know where everyone is eating at all times!
Brandon (as Cup): [still gruffly] I smell it!
Amanda: He can see her.
Lauren: It’s not part of your powers. Um…
Brandon (as Cup): I'll curse you so hard!!
Eric: [chuckling] Is that the voice? Is that the character voice?
Brandon: I guess?
Eric: I like it. It's good.
Lauren: I want the special vial. So I'm gonna, I'm going to try to hop back up on the table and like hide behind one of the bags so I can get…get to it.
Amanda: Okay, I think you can do that since you know the layout of it so far.
Lauren: Cool.
Amanda: And then actually Cup and Montgomery, because you're closer to the entrance to the room, you see those two men in suits start to kind of prowling around, they're trying to like walk over to the Temple. They're sort of like looking between the tables. One of them starts eyeing the cake. They don't notice you since they’re very focused. But you see that they're clearly looking for something and they're starting to get agitated.
You hear only one side of the conversation as one of them is in his earpiece and he's like…
Amanda (as Man in Suit #1): Yeah, we made these changes, we gave them money!
Amanda (as Man in Suit #2): I don't know where this is, but if they're lying, then we're just gonna have to open…
Amanda (as Man in Suit #1): We’re just going to have to declare war!!
Eric: I don't like that. I think I need to cause a distraction. I say…
Eric (as Montgomery): Cup, do you trust me?
Brandon (as Cup): Literally not at all.
[Lauren chuckles]
Eric (as Montgomery): Well, then I guess it's gonna be okay if I do this!
Eric: And I want to headbutt one of the legs of the table that's holding the giant grape cake, and I want it to come down.
Brandon: I understand what he's doing, and I position myself to just receive the cake.
[Lauren giggles]
Amanda: Okay, let's all roll here. Eric please roll four d6 for using your skill. And Brandon four d6 as well for trying to pursue your goal.
[dice roll]
Eric: Fuck!
Brandon: I got three successes.
Eric: [chuckles] I got one success.
Amanda: Chaos got none. So, this goes off swimmingly. Cup, you actually catch some of the cake in your mouth.
Brandon: Does it just overflow upon me?
Amanda: Uh, it does. It does.
Brandon: Am I just drowning in cake?
Amanda: Exactly, exactly.
Eric: There’s a slomo, and it’s just like…
[Eric sings happy tune]
And it’s just like, coming at you.
Brandon: Yeah, 100%.
Amanda: Yeah and Montgomery you couldn't have asked for a better distraction, because as the cake comes tumbling down, right, it's almost like a like a big kind of pyramid of giant grape balls I described. But as they hit the ground, you realize that they are made of sugar. And they burst open with many smaller grape cakes inside!
[everyone gasps]
Like cake balls, like cake pop balls!
Lauren: [sounding overwhelmed] Oh my god…
Amanda: OF CAKE. Man, they are covered in a wonderful crunchy shell and they just, roll and roll and roll!
Brandon: In slow motion I look over and I say…
Brandon (as Cup): [groggily slow] Did you see this Daisy?!
Lauren (as Daisy): [groggily slow] Yesss!!
[Brandon and Eric sing happy tune]
Eric: It’s so much better when it’s a violin.
Amanda: [baffled] What are you singing?!
Brandon: It’s like, uh…
Eric: Concerto.
Amanda: That’s just a noun.
[Lauren laughs]
Eric: [to Brandon] You know what I’m talking about.
Amanda: And you actually notice one of the tables has Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Vin Diesel at it. And they both spring up, push over the chair and are about to flip the table, until they realize that they are not in fact on set and they are not able to do this.
[Lauren and Eric laughing]
Maybe they would in a different room, but right now Anna Wintour is still standing, so they…they even they do not attempt it.
Brandon: And then Jay-Z is like,
Brandon (as Jay-Z): It's a metaphor!
Eric: Oooph!
[Brandon and Eric chortle]
That’s exactly what happens.
Amanda: Excellent.
Lauren: I want to take advantage of the distraction and knock all of the gift bags off the table.
Amanda: I mean, yeah.
Lauren: So I'm gonna…I'm gonna…I'm gonna party hard.
Amanda: Okay!
Lauren: Now I'm just gonna run in like a zigzag along the table and just knocking them every which way!
Amanda: Great.
Lauren: So I can have access to them on the ground.
Brandon: You’re so small!
Amanda: Amazing!
Eric: Part cat.
Amanda: Excellent. Well, you can roll six d6, as well as the three that are here in my chaos pool.
Eric: I like that in Goat Party it’s like, ‘I want to knock…I want to knock over as many of these as possible’ and in D&D it’s like ‘You fell 90 feet, so roll nine d6, please.
[dice roll]
Lauren: Oh! Six successes.
Amanda: Wow! Amazing. So, you knock over every last one of those goodie bags. You have a mountain of goodie bags that you can jump down into and just cherry pick all that flavors of Chanel lipstick and different models of the iPad and get all rose gold if you want to hold a little pyramid of them!!
Brandon: iPad family!
Eric: You turn on one of the iPads and you set up an eBay account.
Lauren: Sell the other iPads on the eBay account.
Eric: Exactly!
Amanda: Which is a really nice improvement.
Lauren: Yeah!
Eric: Still no headphone jack though.
Amanda: And in this distraction, everybody turns around. They look between the cake and the gift bags when people start running for the gift bags because they want to make sure they get one before, you know, everything…everything goes to hell…
Brandon: Except for Kristen Bell, because she is elegant.
Eric: And crying.
Lauren: And fixing her makeup.
Amanda: You know, she is already live streaming on her own iPad. Instagram Live.
Eric: [laughing] She’s live streaming on an iPad?! She’s like a mom?
Amanda: She is a mom, yeah! And Dax Shephard is In the background just making like goofy bunny ears.
Eric: That’s good.
Amanda: And she’s like, stop that, Dax, I love you.
And also in this distraction, the green vial rolls out of the gift bag it was in, and toward the exit where these two men immediately run toward it and try to jump, both of them, for the vile. And this is obviously suspicious behavior. Something is glowing, and Vin Diesel and Dwayne the Rock Johnson can contain themselves no more, Anna Wintour spell broken, and they RUN to tackle these two men as well. So Dwayne The Rock Johnson and Vin Diesel are each pinning down these giant burly kinda bodyguard looking men and laughing at each other and saying ‘family’ while they do it.
[everyone laughs]
One has a Corona in their hand inexplicably.
Eric: I like the idea of the Met gala special ordered at least one Corona for Vin Diesel.
Amanda: Listen, Bacchanalia means something totally different than it does to you. And people actually excited because Bacchanalia is like, making chaos and having fun.
But then you lose sight of the green vial, Daisy, until you turn around and realize that standing on top of the Temple of Dendur, is Tilda Swinton as Satan, with the green vial in her hand.
Lauren: What?!
Amanda: She…
Brandon: [loudly declares] My Lord!! Bah!
[everyone laughs and chants Lorem ipsum]
Amanda: And then she makes a little silent gesture. Everybody silences, and she says,
Amanda (as Tilda Swinton): Not even Satan condones biological weapons…
[everyone laughing]
Who is responsible?! Who will be responsible?
Amanda: And then looks out over the crowd. And the Met security is running up, and Michael Bloomberg looking confusedly at his phone, um…
[Eric laughs]
Eric: Is Belomina okay?
Amanda: Belomina is laughing and texting. So you are able to run over if you want to make your move in the confusion.
Eric: I would love to.
Amanda: Alright, why don't you please roll four d6.
Eric: Okay, I want to run over and I want to grab one of the iPads. I assume that one of the iPads has like YouTube preloaded on it.
[Lauren laughs]
Amanda: It sure does.
Eric: So I will bleat out, Siri play, Beautiful Day by U2. As I go over to uh to Bilomena and I extend one hoof, as if I ask her to dance.
Amanda: And in goat back at you, from somewhere bleats Siri, ‘Playing Beautiful Day by U2’. And then it begins and Bilomena just looks down. Please roll and we'll see how she thinks this is going.
Eric: Okay.
Lauren: Is it U2? EWE ?
[Amanda gasps]
Eric: Listen, you didn’t know. But the edge? Actually a goat.
Amanda: Explains a lot.
Brandon: That’s why he can’t play guitar, it’s hooves.
Eric: [chuckles] I got one success.
Amanda: I also got one success in the chaos pool over here.
Eric, so Bilomena thinks this is incredibly charming, and she laughs and smiles and shakes her hoof. But she is not able to dance, because she dressed as her favorite instrument, a flute. The pan, the pan flute is very important in Bacchanalias. And she's actually unable to move her legs at all. She had two body men who had to carry her in to the dinner. So she's not able to dance, but she is thoroughly charmed, and she actually scribbles her phone number on a napkin that she then places at your feet.
Eric: I take it into my mouth and as soon as I taste it, and the romance pulsing through that note, I faint.
[everyone laughs]
I can’t deal with it, I pass out.
Amanda: Excellent. Excellent. In the meantime, you know Met security is there they are shutting down this biological weapon attack. Dwayne The Rock Johnson is talking about how he played a homeland security officer once in a movie, and just nodding approvingly to everybody doing their jobs. As he's giving support to a child on Instagram.
[Eric laughs heartily]
And honestly, everybody is laughing, disrupted, thinks that it's a part of the thing. Anna Wintour is accepting everybody's claps with a graceful nod. Tilda Swinton got down from the Temple and no one saw how. Everybody's filming and no one saw how. And you are just left to revel in the cake, to revel in the goody bags, and to revel in this budding romance with an heiress.
You're really having a Goat Party.
Brandon: I just…I just chew on some cake.
Brandon (as Cup): Pretty good party, pretty good party.
Eric (as Montgomery):Because you know what they say in the Abernathy family, ‘You never look a gift goat in the mouth’.
Lauren: Daisy looks up because she has some gifts in her mouth.
Amanda: Yeah!!!!
Eric: And the credits play.
Amanda: [enthusiastically] That’s the Goat Party, wow!!!
[everyone cheers]
Eric: Amanda, you did it! You Goat Mastered a game!
Lauren: Whoa. Such a good Goat Master!
Amanda: I was like, Great! Let's get to the plot. And then we were an hour in!
[everyone laughs]
Eric: Yup. Welcome to DMing.
Amanda: I think it’s how it goes. I think it’s how it goats.
[everyone acknowledges the pun]
And it’s all thanks to my players!
[theme music]
Amanda: Two weeks later, in the Met, a security guard is doing a sweep, and they come across in a bathroom. Open a stall door and make sure that you know there's no onlookers Beasley Frank Wyler, style, waiting install, and then out spills, just 4000 purple bouncy balls, which was Ga-Ga’s final costume. It's chaos, is the costume. It’s chaos. So for four or five years hence, in the Met, randomly a child will pick up a little rubber bouncy ball. We're not quite sure when it will end. Because, you know…that’s chaos for you.
Eric: Some still say Ga-Ga still haunts the Met Gala.
[Lauren laughs]
Amanda: Some say, indeed."

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that everyone from seasoned players to true beginners can enjoy. Where else can you get adventure, intrigue, magic, drama, and lots of high fives all in one place? Right here.
After each episode we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play Dungeons & Dragons and other roleplaying games at home. We also have the Punchbowl, an interview series with people pushing D&D forward creatively, communally and socially. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Eric: Hey, hi, hello! It is summertime Eric, just riding the cool waves into the hot beach, and all that stuff!
We are hard at work with the final arc of Join the Party. But that does not mean we aren’t keeping our D&D skills sharp. This episode is a whole new type of D&D show that we've been kicking around, and I've been stoked to run for a very, very long time. This isn't the main quest, or in the Join the Party universe, but I think you'll find a lot of the same silliness and play that you've come to expect from our crew.
So, enjoy the game of Dungeons and Dragons in Reality, which we recorded in Twenty Sided Store, in Brooklyn, New York.
[theme music]
[audience clapping]
Eric: [enthusiastically announcing] Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to DDR: Dungeons and Dragons in Reality! The second-best game with those initials!
[audience laughing]
Woooo! Yay! Everybody cheer.
[audience woos and claps]
Yeah, so. The reason why we kept saying it was a secret show, is because it kinda is. We're trying something totally new when it comes to playing Dungeons and Dragons live. So just come with us on this journey, please!
Think of this kind of like an escape room. But instead of you and your coworkers arguing about which key slot this golden painted prop is supposed to go into, and then you jam it, and then you break it and they charge you $200…
[member of audience chuckles]
It's happened to me, I’m sorry, [chuckles] It's a podcast live show! Which is governed by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons.
Hello, I am Eric and I'm going to be your Dungeon Master this evening. [orders] Clap.
[audience clapping while Eric laughs]
[continuing laughing] Please clap, I need it.
[Brandon laughs]
Basically, for those of you don't know how D&D works, I am going to lay out the story framework and I have some points for my players to figure out. I'm going to lay out chunks of exposition, control a whole lot of minor characters and just keep everything running smoothly.
And these are our players, look at them! They're so nice.
[audience clapping]
Mike: Oh, hello!
Eric: Now, here's where it gets a little bit different. Ordinarily, players would play a class. So, you might be a fighter, or a barbarian, or a wizard, or cleric, but instead, they're going to be playing themselves. Everyone's class is podcaster…
[audience laughing]
And they have...they have no qualities because podcasting requires no skills.
[audience laughing]
[chuckles] Their species is human, but they each have a different background. And they all have an item to aid them on this adventure. So, please introduce yourself and we’ll start with Brandon.
Brandon: Hey, it’s me!
Amanda: Hello!
[Eric laughs heartily]
Brandon: No one clap. I don't need it.
[audience laughing]
I am Brandon. I am a human as we said. So, my background, for those who might not know, I… this...this nice, classy exterior here. When I was in middle school, I was a saggy-pants wearing, spike bel, former punk. So, my background is former punk.
Amanda: Yesss!
Brandon: And my feature is that I am punk AF, which means when I fall off of my skateboard, I take no falling damage.
Amanda: [mildly excited] Yeah!!
[audience laughs]
Brandon: So, I am proficient in longboards and Pro Tools, which is a music editing software.
[Brandon and Amanda laugh]
Amanda: That joke really kills in podcaster hangouts.
[Eric and audience laughing]
Mike: People listening are gonna pause and be like, “Aha!”
[Amanda and audience laughing]
Brandon: I know English and music theory, those are my two languages. And my item, my special item, is a pair of noise-cancelling headphones with a very long cord, which I can use as a rope or lasso. But I can also listen to things that others may not be able to hear with them. And I can also put them on and get focused. So I can like, go in the zone and get advantage on checks.
Eric: But then he can't hear anything, because they are noise-cancelling. Which is very funny to me.
Brandon: Yes.
Mike: Okay. Hello, my name is Mike. You also can call me Shubes if you want. My background is an amateur rapper…
[audience laughs]
…cuz I was in an improvised hip hop rap group when I was in Seattle.
Um, so let's see. I have a special ability called Battle Rap where I can cast the D&D attack…
Eric: [clarifying] Spell.
Mike: Spell. [clears throat] Vicious Mockery. This is also my second time playing D&D, so please be nice to me.
[Eric chuckles]
I can cast a Vicious Mockery at will if I do a rap. Depending on how good the rap is, I will roll a specific die to see how much psychic damage I do to my opponent.
Amanda: Yeahhh.
Eric: And the beat is going to be me beatboxing, terribly.
Mike: It’s alright, I can do it. I've dealt with worse.
[Amanda and Brandon laugh]
Mike: So my – my….
Eric: Listen, there are worse people, so it’s going pretty well.
Mike: The languages that I speak are English and Hype man.
[audience chuckles]
I have proficiencies in cooking and hair products. And my item is in New York Knicks basketball, with which I can compel someone to play hoops with me and I get +5 to Persuasion if I do. Also, it's a basketball!
[audience laughs]
That’s where I’m at.
[Eric continues laughing]
Amanda: That’s very good.
I'm Amanda McLoughlin, playing Amanda McLoughlin. I have a background of aspiring librarian, which I wish I was instead of a podcaster. So, that means that I speak the languages of English but also conversational hacking. Because librarianship and hacking are very related, ask your librarian friends.
And my skills are Pinterest, meaning that I can do like those DIY projects that you see on Pinterest all the time. I can do them like so fast. And also, like handyman stuff. Like stuff you have to call your dad to be like, how do I change this light bulb, but like I can do really quick.
And then my magic item is a thing that I really do carry, which is the introvert’s survival kit. So, It's like a little baggie with you know, like mints, and gum, and a phone charger, and pens and band-aids. But how it actually works here is I have to roll for Luck. If I get a 10 or above, I can choose what item I pull out of this like, bag of holding. The only constraint is that it has to be able to pass through airport security. So, it can be like a leather man or a liquid above 3 ounces.
[everyone chuckles]
Brandon: It can be a bunch of liquids up to 3 ounces though.
Amanda: That’s true! It can be a quart size bag of tiny little liquids.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Eric: It’s just going to be Amanda rolling, like, “I need 2 ounces of whiskey”, and she rolls on it.
Amanda: Nice!
Eric: “I need 2 ounces of contact solution”, and she rolls on it.
Amanda: And If I fail that roll, then the DM has to choose for me what item comes out of the bag instead. So, it could be like a frog…I don't know. That’s for you to choose.
[Everyone laughs]
Mike: I mean, those can go through airport security. So, it’s fine.
Amanda: That’s true, that’s true.
Oh, yes. And I have organizational skills. So, whenever I…I like a picture that there's like a murder board on the wall, only it's disorganized. I can like identify what the information is because I'm a nerd! And I want to be a librarian.
Eric: That's it and that's your players. So that is what they are going to work with. Obviously, this is different. But we think that it might be funny, and you laughed at some of them, so I think it's gonna go okay.
[audience chuckles[
Brandon: Eric -Eric, real quick. I just want to interrupt that Shubes did add to his character sheet, under personality traits, he did write “really cool”. So, uh…
[audience laughs]
Mike: Also, under flaws, I put, “cares too much”.
[Eric laughs, some clapping]
And under bonds, I put “covalent”.
Amanda: Aww, love it.
[audience laughs]
Eric: Well Mike, this is a group interview for an engineering job.
[everyone laughs]
So, you’re well on your way!
Mike: Good, gotta get back in the game!
Eric: Yeah. Is everybody ready?
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: Okay. The three of you wake up in a dimly-lit room laying on a surprisingly comfortable king size mattress.
Mike: Are we all on the same mattress?
Amanda: Hold on. Are we head-to-toe? Are we perpendicular?
Brandon: Is it the same blanket?
Mike: Is it the same mattress?
Eric: Same mattress, no blanket and you're all like sardines next to each.
Mike: Am I middle spoon?
Eric: Yes.
[Amanda chuckles]
Mike: Good, okay.
Eric: You know, I wrote that down, “Mike loves middle spoon”.
Mike: I do, it’s so good!
Amanda: Both, it’s best of both.
Eric: Is this character Mike Schubert, or is this you personally?
Mike: No, real life. I've…
Eric: It’s all the same.
Mike: I mean, yeah, I would love to be the middle spoon.
[audience chuckles]
I also vastly prefer little spoon to big spoon.
Brandon: I’m learning a lot about you tonight.
[audience laughing heartily]
Mike: I just feel safe and secure.
Eric: Mike, on Bonds, just write down little spoon.
[chuckles] You're groggy and disoriented, as you were not all hanging out the night before. And you were also not wearing these beautiful tracksuits when you fell asleep.
[Mike hums, intrigued]
Brandon: What color?
Eric: Blue.
Brandon: Great.
[Eric and audience giggle]
Eric: You also don't remember your right ankles being this heavy because there is a strange weight encircling each one of them, affixed with a glowing green light.
Amanda: Uh oh.
Eric: Now I want to ask all three of you, what is the last thing you remember?
Amanda: [breathes deeply] I remember falling asleep at home with a heavy book on my lap, obviously.
Eric: Of course.
Amanda: Mhm.
Mike: I remember starting one more episode of something on Netflix and then saying I'll brush my teeth after and then falling asleep on my bed.
[everyone laughs]
Brandon: I finished a whole pizza, which I haven't done since college, and did fall asleep watching Chef's Table.
Eric: You know, in my head I was just like, “Oh, I was just like hanging out with my friends and all of a sudden it all went black”, but I love that all three of you were like I was in my bed…
[everyone laughing]
I was comfortable. The character and player are exactly the same, I like it.
Amanda: Mhm.
Eric: All of a sudden, you hear a beautiful melodious voice come out of nowhere.
Eric (as Melodious Voice): [loud, accented woman’s voice] Good morning Dungeoneers!
[Mike hums in disapproval]
Brandon: Nope.
[Amanda murmurs discontent]
[audience laughs]
Eric: Well, this is the voice I’m doing, so just get used to it.
[everyone laughing]
You look up and you see a PA system and a camera in the corner encased in plexiglass.
Eric (as Melodious Voice): [excitedly] I see that you have woken up! Wonderful! It is so much better to have actual players than just bodies strewed upon the ground and don't worry Mike, I made sure you're the little spoon.
Mike: Oh, yay!
Eric (as Melodious Voice): First, let me introduce myself. [mischievously] I am the Dungeon Master. You are all in my dungeon. You will play by my rules. I’ve put many through many trials, but you will be the best competitors yet! I know it! Podcasters will be perfect for this grueling challenge of Strengths, Wits, and Constitution.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Get it? Because podcasters have skills and things. That was a reference to earlier in the show.
[everyone laughing]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Uh, et me tell you the rules. You will have 15 minutes to complete my puzzles! And walk through the golden door at the end! There you will have a Chuck E. Cheese party in the party room. And all of the games work and there is good pizza! I promise!
Amanda: Is that the winning scenario?
[Brandon and audience laughing]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): That is! Also, Charles Entertainment Cheese himself will be there!
Mike: Wait, is that what the “E” in Chuck E. Cheese stands for?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): That is! That is real!
[podcasters gasp in surprise]
Amanda: Wow! Nightmare after nightmare!
Brandon: We should...we should try to lose I think.
Amanda: Yeah…
Eric: But don’t worry, I wouldn't be much of a Dungeon Master without giving you a hint. There is a 2004 Verizon razor phone hidden somewhere in the dungeon.
[Amanda laughs heartily]
Mike: That's actually good. I never had one as a kid, so…[chuckles] I want one now.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: I’m so sorry Mike.
Uh, and then all of a sudden, the three of you feel a phone buzz underneath you.
Amanda: I look under the duvet.
Eric: There is no blanket. It is just a mattress.
Brandon: In the mattress, or is it?
Amanda: Feel it under the mattress?
Eric: You don't feel it.
Amanda: Under the pillow?
Eric: There is no pillow.
Amanda: I look under the bed.
Eric: It is not under the bed.
Brandon: Okay, it’s in the mattress.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): [frazzled] I’m still saying the instructions, please!!
Mike: I got it, I got it! I scream, “Hey Siri”.
[everyone laughs]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Well, it’s a 2004 razor phone, so…
[everyone laughing]
Mike: Oh!!! I didn’t know if this was the razor.
Brandon: Me and Amanda just look at you, like what are you doing?!
[Amanda laughing]
Mike: I’m trying!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Good luck! And the timer starts right now!
Brandon: Amanda, did you want to try to like pull out some sort of cutting utensil out of your bag?
Mike: Is there anything under the mattress or is it flat on the floor?
Eric: It is flat on the floor.
Mike: Okay, let's cut open the mattress.
Amanda: I pull - I'm gonna roll to pull a…oh shit I can’t have a knife, it has to go through TSA!
Mike: No, you can do the really tiny nail clipper knife!
Amanda: Okay! Really tiny nail clipper scissors.
Eric: Okay.
[dice roll]
Amanda: I got a 2.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: So what comes out of the bag instead?
Eric: So you reach in your pack and you pull out a banana.
[audience laughing]
Mike: I eat the banana.
Eric: Good.
Amanda: [sounding unsure] And then I use the sharp end of the peel to try to cut open the mattress…?
[dice rolls]
Eric: [laughing] What?! Okay roll for Nature, and you better roll really well.
Amanda: Um, I'm sorry, that was only an 11.
Eric: Alright, with an 11, [chuckling] you smoosh the banana against it. It doesn’t smoosh totally, but it is…it doesn’t cut open the mattress.
Okay, so you're in the setting. This is in fact an abandoned Chuck E. Cheeses.
Mike: Okay.
Eric: The wallpaper of brightly colored pizza slices and 90s designs are faded. And you can see the indentations in the weird purple carpet where games and attractions once stood. Also there are weird stains, but it's not that weird for a Chuck E. Cheeses.
[everyone laughs]
You were in the atrium of the Chuck E. Cheeses, so there are double doors that, behind you, that should go into a parking lot, but it's just darkness. And then in front of you there is like one of those open hallway doors.
Mike: Okay. Um, I look in the mattress if there's a zipper on it. Is there a zipper?
Eric: Okay, do an Investigation check, Mike.
Mike: Okay, that’s the d20?
Amanda: Yes.
[dice rolls]
Mike: I rolled a 9.
Eric: And you add your intelligence.
Mike: Oh, baby. [surprised] Oh, -1!
[everyone laughs]
Eric: With an 8…
Mike: I’m into rice, come on!!
[Amanda and Eric laugh]
Eric: With an 8, you–you look around and are like, “Mmp, it must be one of those Casper mattresses”.
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda: I'm going to lift up the mattress and look under it, fully.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a 5 + Strength, which is…3.
Brandon: I’ll help Amanda.
Amanda: That’s an 8.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: [chuckles in reaction to roll] That’s a 9.
Eric: Okay…
Mike: I also help to lift the mattress!!
Eric: You guys don’t… [laughs heartily]
[dice rolls]
Mike: And I also rolled an 8, but I’m a strong…[change in thought] Oh, no…no.I don’t have, I have a +1 for athletics.
Eric: Okay, okay. With a 9, you can lift up a mattress…
[audience laughs]
And, the 2004 razor falls out.
Amanda: Yay!!!
Mike: Yesss.
Brandon: Oh good, cool.
Mike: Phew!
Amanda: We open it up, what does it say?
Eric: There is a text in there from someone called Jeremy? And Jeremy says, Hey, DM, want to get tacos tonight? So here's - here's the deal with this phone. This phone has 10% battery. It is a 2004 razor. But you can still download like those super janky apps, So you can do anything that you would do with it… with like an old phone.
Brandon: I play snake until it runs out of battery.
[Eric and Mike laugh]
Eric: [short pause] Is that really what you want to do?
Brandon: No, no, no.
Amanda: I open the web browser accidently and my dad yells at me because I racked up a $20 data bill in 4 seconds!
[Eric chuckles]
So you can do anything...you could only do one thing and it's super slow because it's a 2004 razor.
Amanda: Alright.
Eric: But it’s in very nice condition.
Amanda: Let's hold on to this until we really need it.
Brandon: Keep it.
Mike: Yeah.
Amanda: And try to go through the non-double doors?
Mike: Yes. Okay, who's going through the door first?
Brandon: Let’s go through the door.
Eric: Alright. So who is going to walk through the door first?
Brandon: Not it.
Mike: I’ll do it. Do I need to roll for door?
Eric: No, you're fine.
So like you try to walk through, and then Mike, you feel a buzzing sensation from the thing that's attached to your ankle…
Mike: Right.
Eric: …and you take 1 point of damage.
Mike: Okay. [exclaims] Ow guys! This hurt. But I'm going to keep going cause it only hurt a little.
Eric: [laughing] Okay.
[Brandon and audience join in laughing]
Alright, alright. Well here we go. Mike? I want…
[Eric takes short pause to refrain from laughing while audience giggles]
Mike, you're gonna take 5 steps forward, and you take 2 more points of damage.
Mike: Alright, I turn around.
[audience lightly chuckles]
Eric: Okay, great. So Mike, as you went in through the door, you saw what happened, what's next. There in the hallway, there are 2 different arrows. There is one that points to the left that says, “Adult Stuff, Boo!” on it and then the other one says, “Game Room, Nice!”. And you run back into the atrium before you can go any further.
Mike: I saw arrows! One said Adults Stuff, Boo!”. One said, “Kid Stuff, Nice!”.
Amanda: That's weird.
Mike: But then it started hurting the farther I walked, so I came back.
Amanda: Uh oh.
Brandon: Good choice. Good choice.
Mike: Yeah.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: Can we try to see if there's any like traps or tripwires around the archway?
Eric: Uh, sure. Why doesn’t everyone make a Perception check?
[multiple dice rolls]
Mike: Oh, it's a 17!
Amanda: I got a 21!
Eric: Oh, okay.
Brandon: Got a 15.
Eric: Okay, so Mike and Brandon, you look around and this is in fact a Chuck E. Cheeses and you do not like it. You realize that the 2 arrows are going to go off into different parts of the Chuck E. Cheeses, it’s just the front. So like if you go on down one of those hallways, you're going to go somewhere else.
Amanda with a 21, you look around the room and you notice that the wallpaper looks like, cut out in one little spot, which is about 10 feet off the ground.
Amanda: Yo, can someone give me a boost?!
Mike: Yes, uh, we give her a boost.
Brandon: We do thing where we interlock our hands and then get her foot.
Mike: [mumbles] Get her foot.
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: Okay, so you guys make Strength checks, and Amanda, you make a Dexterity check.
Amanda: Alright.
[dice rolls]
Mike: I got 17 for that.
Brandon: [quietly] Uh…uhhh. Uh… [short pause] 3?
Eric: Okay, great. Good.
Amanda: I also got a 3.
Eric: [giggling] Okay. Alright, everyone is in position. Brandon, you try to hold up Amanda, and does a bad job of holding her-her balance and then she flops over on top of Brandon.
Brandon: Cool, cool.
Amanda: Not a good start.
Eric: And Amanda is just like sitting on Brandon's chest.
Brandon: Is there anything like, uh, like sticking out from the panel that I could like, that we could grab like a handle or anything?
Eric: Yeah, I think the panel is sticking, is definitely sticking out a little bit. So if you want it to like jump up and try to hit it? You could.
Brandon: But is there like a handle or anything? That’s like outcropping from the panel itself?
Eric: Oh. Why don’t you make an Investigation check?
[dice rolls]
Brandon: [short pause, followed by chuckle] Uh…3?
Amanda: No. [slightly quieter] Oh no…
Eric: Bud, I’m sorry. There is not that.
Brandon: It’s cool. Great.
Mike: Can I throw my basketball at it?
Amanda: [excitedly yells] YES!!!
Eric: Yeah, yeah man.
Amanda: Yes!!
Eric: Alright. So, to make a Dexterity, it’s gonna be an attack roll. [chuckling] And I think you have basketball as one of your weapons.
Mike: I do!
[dice rolls]
So I rolled a 3, but I have +2 for Dexterity and then +4 attack bonus for basketball.
Eric: Okay, so you have +4. So, what is that?
Amanda: 9.
Eric: 9?
Mike: Because it was +6 total, yeah.
Eric: Okay, um. So, you're going to throw the basketball at the panel and what does it look…[giggling] how do you do it?
Mike: I'm just trying to like hit it, you know, if you like hit something and then maybe it'll pop open?
Eric: Okay.
Mike: So, I threw a chest pass at it.
Eric: So I think you [chuckles] throw a hard chest pass at the panel, and it pops off. But you did it way too hard. So the ball like bounces and hits totally the other side of the…of the room.
Also, you guys look up there and there is a computer. But unfortunately, the computer has a crack in it because Mike threw his basketball too hard.
[audience chuckles]
But, you guys look down and you see that all of your anklets now no longer have the green light on them.
[podcasters all sigh in understanding together]
Amanda: Is that better or worse?
Mike: I think it means we won't get hurt. I'm gonna, since I'm already the hurt boy and I done goofed and hit the computer really hard with a basketball, I'm gonna try to go back towards the arrows and see if it doesn't hurt me this time.
Eric: Alright Mike, you walk through the archway and you brace yourself for electric shock and you don't feel anything!
Amanda: [in mild excitement] Yay!!!
Eric: You just feel bad that you broke property.
Brandon: Nice, nice, nice.
Mike: Can I pick up my basketball?
Eric: Oh yeah, for sure. It’s just a basketball.
Mike: Oh, okay. I pick up my basketball, I spin it and then I say, “Come on guys”.
[podcasters laughing, Eric doots doots a tune]
Amanda: We walk through.
Eric: Okay, so you are now at the arrows as Mike said before. And one says, “Adult Stuff, Boo!” which goes off to the left. And the other one says, “Game Room, Nice!”, which goes off to the right.
Mike: I feel like it's reverse psychology, I want to go to “Adult Stuff, Boo!”.
Brandon: Yeah, there's like crosswords in there. I'll do some, like…?
Amanda: I feel like we're gonna be better at that than we would be at the kid games.
Mike: Yes.
Amanda: So we're gonna go to the “Adult Stuff, Boo!”.
Eric: Okay, so you hear the PA system crackles to life and the Dungeon Master comes back, and they’re like...
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Oh!! You figured out my first puzzle. I hope it wasn't too shocking.
[Amanda and Mike boo, audience laughs]
Get it? It was electricity. It was an electric fence?
[Amanda and Mike continue booing]
You’re trapped in my puzzles and your booing me!? I’m going to have to make it harder!
Amanda: How about you let us out and we’ll give you all of the feedback you want?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Oh that’s so good! Just walk through the doors and I – [tone changes to malevolent] NO I'm not going to do that.
Amanda: It was worth a try.
Eric: Okay, so you’re going into “Adult Stuff, Boo!”, right?
Mike: Mhm.
Eric: You're going to open up the very like just regular wooden door because this is like, where the adults do their office things. And you…
[audience laughs]
…and you can see that there is a – there’s a hole that is carved into the purple carpet. And it is like a 5-foot hole, in total, I don't know, diameter? I don't know math. And it's very dark as you look down. And you can see as you walk over there, you can see here, like very muffled sounds of someone yelling.
Amanda: From the hole?
Eric: From the hole.
Brandon: From down in the hole?
Amanda: Any there any other doors or windows in the room?
Eric: No, well…there-there are like some old motivational posters. So there's one of the cat holding himself up, like, “Keep your chin up!” and there's just like some papers that are strewn around.
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: I scream, “Hello, can you hear us?!”
Eric: You hear from the hole,
Eric (as Voice in Hole): Help? I’m really stuck! Someone please help!
Mike: I ask, who are you?
Eric (as Voice in Hole): Hi, I'm acclaimed actor David Boreanaz!
[audience laughs heartily]
[short pause] Please, I need your help!
Brandon: It sounds exactly like him!
Eric (as David Boreanaz): I was in Bones and Angel!
Amanda: Uh, Brandon, your headphones!
Brandon: Yeah! How far down are you, would you guess?
Eric (as David Boreanaz): Emily Deschanel is actually really nice in person!
[audience laughs]
Brandon: That’s not what I asked!
Amanda: Focus! Focus David!
Eric (as David Boreanaz): Oh! Thank you, thank you! You’re here to help!
Amanda: How far down are you, bud?
Brandon: How far down are you?
Eric (as David Boreanaz): Help, I'm really stuck! Please, someone help me!
Brandon: Is there anything that I can throw down this hole?
Eric: There are the papers and you have everything on your person.
Amanda: Um, how about I make a paper chain out of the papers with my Pinterest skill?
Eric: Oh shit. Okay, yeah. Roll for Dexter…Sleight of Hand? I don’t know? It’s a Pinterest skill!
Amanda: Do I get advantage because of my skill?
Eric: Yeah, sure.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: 11 +, what do you want? Proficiency is 13.
Eric: Okay, yeah. You can see how the profits of Chuck E. Cheese are going way down. But now it’s a cute little paper chain and it’s fine!
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda: So I lower down, hold on to one end and say, “Hey, David, Can you grab this?”
Eric (as David Boreanaz): Hi! I'm acclaimed actor David Boreanaz. Please, I need your help!
Brandon: It’s a tape recorder, right?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric (as David Boreanaz): From Bones and Angel!
Amanda: I let go of the paper chain.
Eric (as David Boreanaz): Emily Deschanel is actually really nice in person!
Brandon: The series finale of Angel was terrible!
Eric (as David Boreanaz): [short pause] Oh, thank you, thank you! You're here to help.
[audience laughing]
Amanda: They kind of fixed it in the comics, I'll tell you about it later. Anyway, should we go to the kids room?
Brandon: Sure?
Mike: Yeah, there’s nothing else to do in this room.
Brandon: I'd like to like take the poster, the cat poster?
Eric: Yeah. Okay Brandon, I want you to roll a d20.
Brandon: Ohhh…
[dice rolls]
Do I add anything to it?
Eric: No.
Brandon: 8.
Eric: Brandon, you…
[Eric pauses trying not to laugh, audience laughing]
Brandon: You don’t know, it could be good!
Eric: You take the cat poster down and there is… just like someone graffitied it. It says, “Brandon smells weird”.
Amanda: Oh no!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): I did that!! Wasn’t that funny?! I knew you would look for things! Sorry you didn’t help out David Boreanaz, he’s a very nice person.
[audience laughs]
Brandon: Cool, okay. I calmly put the poster back. So no one can see this graffiti.
Eric (as David Boreanaz): Help! I'm really stuck. Someone please help me! [more quickly] Hi! I’m acclaimed actor David Boreanaz, please! I need your help!
Brandon: [short pause] So, kid’s room, or...?
Amanda: Kid’s room.
Mike: Yea, kid’s room.
Amanda: Close that door firmly behind us.
Eric: As you close the door firmly, you hear the muffled sound of…
Eric (as David Boreanaz): [muffled] “I was in Bones and Ange!”.
[Eric makes incoherent muffled David Boreanaz statements as podcasters distance themselves]
Eric: And you guys are going into the other room. You look around and you see this is a very large room. There are old tables that are arranged around this very, very large pile of trash. And you also see that there is a stage. Um, and on that stage is the decomposing robotic body of Billy Bob Riccoli…
Brandon: Oh no…
Eric: A brown bear who wears yellow and red overalls and played a wooden bass and I didn't make that up.
[audience laughs]
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: Oh…
Eric: You also hear under the pile of trash, you hear another voice going,
Eric (as Voice Under Trash): Hello. Hey, Can someone help me? I'm stuck under here.
Brandon: Are you a real one this time?
Eric (as Voice Under Trash): What?! Why wouldn’t I be real?
[podcasters incoherently agree to move forward]
Eric: The Dungeon Master that comes back on the PA and says...
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Oh, well! You’re not the first person to come in through this dungeon! David Boreanaz came through and he's actually very nice in person! But I’ve crushed the spirit of people before you! And I think that I will crush yours as well. I guess you could ask her for help. [short pause] If You dare. [quietly] Hahaha, take it back now y'all.
[audience chuckles]
Eric: And the PA switches off.
Amanda: One hop this time? Is that…
Eric: There’s no response.
Amanda: I thought that would be the code to get out of here.
Mike: So, where was this voice coming from?
Eric: It's coming from under the large, very giant pile of trash, which is in the middle. I should tell you it's also on top of a dance floor, which is the entire space in which, you know, all the tables are around.
Brandon: Is this trash really heavy? Why are you stuck?
Eric (as Voice Under Trash): Yeah, I’m stuck underneath the red barrel, please help me! It hurts so much!
Mike: I move the red barrel.
Amanda: Let’s clear it. Yeah.
Eric: Okay. There is a red barrel that is kind of over on like on the right side of the big pile of trash. And you see that there are legs seeking out from under it. You push it over if there's like a 19 year old girl who's just like in overalls, and just like totally dirty, covered in dust. She's like...
Eric (as 19-Year Old Girl): Oh my God, thank you. Thank you so much. I hate this, I hate this place. I've been stuck here for so long, and I was stuck under that red barrel.
Mike: Hi, my name is Mike. Nice to meet you. What's...what’s happening?
[audience laughs]
Eric (as 19-Year Old Girl): Listen, I don’t know! My name is DJ and I'm a DJ. I'm a DJ...DJ. That’s my DJ name.
Amanda: We're gonna visit that later. How did you get stuck here and what have you learned about the place? We think that David Boreanaz is not David Boreanaz, and, I don't know, there might be computers hidden places.
Eric (as DJ): Yeah, that definitely sounds about right. I definitely did this, but it was like a Long John Silver's theme? I think they switch it up every once in a while.
Amanda: That's worse.
Eric (as DJ): Definitely worse. This is better. Where are we?
Amanda: It's kind of a Chuck E. Cheeses, I guess.
Eric (as DJ): Oh, it's kind of a Chuck E. Cheeses? That’s worse than a Chuck E. Cheeses.
[audience chuckles]
Amanda: Are there any exits in this room?
Eric (as DJ): I can’t…I don't know. I just kind of woke up underneath this red barrel after I lost the last challenge. The Dungeon Master found out I was a DJ and he made me like eat vinyl records? It was really gross.
Mike: What was that, the whole challenge? You just had to eat records?
Eric (as DJ): Yeah, I was super gross. Found out I was a DJ. I hated it so much.
Brandon: That sounds more like a prank than a challenge.
Eric: The PA comes back on,
Eric (as Dungeon Master): [enthusiastically] It was hilarious for me! I got 2000 hits on my YouTube channel!
Eric: And then turn it back off.
Amanda: Can I investigate windows? Doors? Traps?
Eric: Absolutely.
Brandon: Is there anything of use in the trash? Can I investigate that too?
[dice rolls]
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: 11.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 18.
Eric: Okay, I'm gonna start with Amanda's first. So Amanda, you look around…
Amanda: Oh, I’m just kidding! It’s 16.
Eric: Oh, 16. Okay.
Amanda: Forgot my proficiency bonus like I do in every episode of Join the Party.
Eric: Hey!! So, [giggles] you look around the room. And there are two double doors that are sealed shut. And you can go over to them and try to shake them and they are locked. And DJ the DJ says,
Eric (as DJ): You know, I don't think they would, the Dungeon Master would just let us out like that. I feel like there has to be some sort of password or pass code? I don't know. It must have put me in here for a reason?
Brandon: What did you do get stuck underneath a barrel?
Eric (as DJ): I just kind of woke up underneath the barrel! I don't really know.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Okay, so here's a list of the things that are in the trash. There is a refrigerator, a large pane of glass, 3 broken cages, some microscopes, 2 fire extinguishers, a set of weights, a giant industrial fan blade, wooden crates, and the red barrel. Plus they're also the whole…the robotic skeleton of, what the fuck was that guys name?
Amanda: The bear?
Eric: Billy Bob Broccolini? Or whatever his name is.
Brandon: I’m sorry, Billy Bob Broccolini?
Eric: Brocc-o-li? Brocc-o-li is his name.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Get it? And he's holding a wooden bass as well. And overalls.
Amanda: His base is there and it's playable?
Eric: Uh, yes
Amanda: I'm gonna pick it up.
Eric: [laughing] You are now holding a wooden bass.
Amanda: I don’t know! We have a DJ and a rapper. I feel like…
Mike: Yes.
Amanda: I feel like we need some kind of freestyle rap to get out of here.
Brandon: Hold out my noise cancelling headphones immediately.
[Amanda and audience laughing]
Mike: Okay, so there is a thought that the door needs something to open it. Can I investigate somehow of like, what might need to be done to the door to get it to open?
Eric: Okay, why don't you make a Perception check for that one?
Mike: Okay.
[dice rolls]
Mike: It's a 7.
Eric: Okay, with a 7, you see that the door is locked.
Mike: Okay.
[audience laughs]
Mike: Okay, so the door is locked.
Eric: Also, there are some wires that are coming off of the door, but it's like they're stapled to the wall. And they're attached to some speakers.
Mike: Okay. Can we turn him on somehow?
Eric: Yeah. Check it, check it out.
Mike: Okay. I go over to the decomposing bass player and see if there's some sort of power switch to get him on to start playing bass.
Amanda: Yeah, I put the bass back in his hands and say sorry.
Eric: Interesting. Alright. Why don't you make, uh….
Amanda: And I can do a handyman assessment maybe to see if there's any like minor soldering that has to happen before he goes on.
Eric: Cool. Cool. Yeah. Why do you make a roll for that? And Mike, there is an on/off switch, because I don’t know what else to do.
Mike: I flip the switch on.
Eric: Okay, it does not turn on.
Amanda: I got a 12, anything need fixing?
Eric: Uh, yeah, his elbow is broken, which would not be able to let him play the bass. And also, he's missing batteries.
Mike: So, Oh! There was stuff in the trash.
Brandon: Uh, batteries?
Mike: I don't know.
Brandon: There was a refrigerator.
Eric: There is a refrigerator, a large pane of glass, 3 broken cages, some microscopes, 2 fire extinguishers, a set of weights, a large industrial fan blade, wooden crates, and a red barrel. Plus the weird animal.
Brandon: None of those are batteries.
Amanda: The microscope might have [hopefully pitches voice] batteries?
[podcasters speak in hopefully high-pitched voices]
Brandon: Is that not plugged in to a power source?
Amanda: Nope, sorry. Sources telling me there are no batteries in a microscope.
Mike: Is there a way for us to power this person by like, making a Rube Goldberg?
Amanda: Or tunes?
Brandon: Hey DJ, do you have batteries?
Eric (as DJ): Okay, let me, yeah, let me just look around.
Amanda: Noise-cancelling headphones!
Brandon: That's true. What kind of noise-cancelling headphones are they? Are they battery powered?
Eric: Well, why don't you roll an Investigation check and DJ is also gonna check her pants.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: Uh, 15.
Eric: Okay, with a 15, you look at your noise-cancelling headphones, and they do have batteries! They're powered by one really large D battery that you can only get in like one store. But it's like, in Topeka.
Amanda: It’s heavy headphones, oh my god.
Eric: Yeah. DJ also checks her pockets, and she says that she finds a to-do list in her pocket. And she’s like,
Eric (as DJ): I didn't write this, it isn't my handwriting.
Eric: And It looks like chicken scratch, like a 5-year old tried to write it down. And the first one says, “Get the music”. The second one says, “Clear the dance floor”, and the third one says, “Do the dance”.
Mike: Ohhh.
Amanda: Ohh-kay. I’ll get the bear, y'all clear the dance floor. Let’s do this. So…
Mike: Yes.
Eric: Brandon and Mike I want you to both make Strength checks.
[two dice rolls]
Mike: That is a 6!
Brandon: 11.
Eric: [chuckles] Mike…
Amanda: Listen, we’re podcasters. Did we not say that before?
Eric: [still chuckling] Mike, you try to push over the refrigerator, like ugh, I’m going to push the refrigerator!
Mike: I do a quick set of reps on the weights.
[Amanda and audience laughing]
Eric: Okay, you still need to clear the dance floor, it's not yet fully cleared. So you might need to roll again. Not now though. You’re like, this is too large, I can’t do it in one go.
Amanda: I got a 12 for handyman, so I'll use the battery. I'll try to like, just put the elbow back together and tighten the screws and just put my fingers….
Eric: Okay, cool.
Amanda: How does it work?
Eric: Alright, so now you put the batteries in it and the…. the elbow is back and you turn it back on? And, uh, Billy Bob comes to life!
Amanda: What have I done?!
Mike: Sweet.
[audience laughs]
Eric: [doot doots tune] Then you hear just like, there's a beat that starts with like [doom-shh-doom-shhh-doom-shhh]. And you can hear now Billy Bob opens his mouth says,
Eric (as Billy Bob): [yelling] To the left! Take it back now y'all!
Mike: Oh yes.
Eric: [slowly gets louder as lyrics play] One hop this time! Errrr. Left turn, let’s stomp! Errrr. Left foot, let’s stomp!
Mike: I’ve already been doing everything he’s saying.
Eric (as Billy Bob): Cha Cha now y'all! [continues singing rhythm of the Cha Cha Slide] Turn it out! To the right!
Eric: [giggling] He’s just going to keep going.
[Billy Bob continues singing Cha Cha Slide]
Amanda: So we’re going to clear the dance floor.
[multiple dice rolls]
Mike: That was too many dice rolls.
[Eric continues singing Cha Cha Slide]
Mike: I rolled a 16!
[audience laughs]
Amanda: No.
[Eric continues singing Cha Cha Slide]
Amanda: I rolled a 14.
[Eric continues singing Cha Cha Slide]
Brandon: I rolled 4.
Amanda: We cleared the dance floor!
Eric: [laughing] Okay! So you fully cleared the dance floor. And now, now Billy Bob is just fully going at it.
Amanda: What was that before then?
[everyone laughs]
Eric: And then he gets to the part where he’s like, “Get funky with it!”, and he’s going to do the thing where you put your hands on your knees and it goes back and forth.
Amanda: Criss-cross?
Eric: And it goes, [makes grinding noise], and DJ is still off-off in the corner just watching you guys try to dance this out.
Amanda: DJ, come here, do the dance with us!
Mike: Come on DJ, we all have to Cha Cha Slide.
Eric (as DJ): I do not want to do this.
Amanda: You want to get out of here and not?
Eric (as DJ): Just… do I have to dance in front of other people?
Mike: DJ, this is not dancing. This is following instructions. You can do this!
Amanda: Furthermore, we’re podcasters,I think you're going to be a little bit better than us.
Eric (as DJ): I don’t…
Mike: [interrupting] Wow, wow, wow. You will not be better than me!
[audience laughs]
Eric: Alright, so everybody make Performance checks to try to empower DJ as well.
Mike: [contemplative] Performance…
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 14!
Mike: 20.
Brandon: Natural 20!
Eric: 20?
Mike: Yes!
Brandon: He wasn't lying, he can dance.
[audience laughs]
Amanda: I got a non-natural 20.
Eric: Okay, you guys, yeah ...So Mike is just like tearing it up on the dance floor, so freaking hard. That DJ is like...
Eric (as DJ): Oh, you know, actually ...okay, that sounds pretty fun. Just like, don't tell any of my friends that I'm doing this.
Mike: Don't worry, we got you. Dance like no one's watching because literally no one's here.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Ah, watching? I’m watching! You're doing great.
Mike: Thank you.
Eric: DJ ignores it, and she joins you all as you do the Cha Cha Slide. And as Billy Bob is playing it, he goes…
Eric (as Billy Bob): [exclaiming] Stop. Freeze. Everybody. Clap your hands!
[everyone claps along with Cha Cha Slide]
Eric: And as you guys clap to the rhythm of Billy Bob, you hear the creakkkk of double doors open.
Mike: Nice, nice.
Eric: And now you can move on to the next room!
Amanda: [whispers] Yes!
Mike: As we move on to the next room, he gets to the part where he's like “Charlie Brown” and we're like what does that mean?!
[everyone laughs]
Does anyone know what that was!? And then we keep going.
Eric: DJ says...
Eric (as DJ): I'm gonna try to go the other way. I think my friend David Boreanaz is here. I'm gonna try to find him.
Mike: Have fun.
Amanda: Godspeed.
Brandon: It definitely is there, for real.
Eric (as DJ): Hey, did you guys see my see my talkbox anywhere?
Mike: Uh, check in the bottom of the pit.
Eric (as DJ): Oh! That's why I left it, that’s right!
Eric: And she runs off in the other direction.
Amanda: David Boreanaz is totally dead isn’t he?!
[Mike and Brandon laugh]
Oh no…
Brandon: His soul is trapped in the talkbox.
[Amanda and Eric make sounds of discomfort at the idea]
Eric: And then you as you walk-walk away down the hall, it says “Reverse, reverse!” And it gets slowly farther away, [slightly quieter] “Reverse, reverse!” [even quieter] “Reverse, reverse!”. And now you no longer have to do the Cha Cha Slide, congratulations.
Mike: Thank you.
Eric: Just like in real life, it’s mandatory until you just walk away.
[everyone laughs]
Amanda: Until the next wedding any of us attend.
Eric: Or bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah or b’nai Mitzvah.

[midroll transition music]
Eric: Okay, you now walk into another very large room. And you see like, you see all the weird indentations where arcade games used to be. So it’s just kind of like empty except for the little like push-in pegs of the legs. And you look around, and the only thing that is in this room is a giant play-place.
Mike: Oh!!
Eric: You know like one of the McDonald play-places? Like imagine this is like, on steroids. Like this is full sized for people, for real humans to run through, human adults to run through. And there is just one entrance in the front. And it says, “Come on in!”. And in really, really large black and purple letters.
Brandon: [short pause] We're not doing this right?
Mike: [laughing] I kind of want to do it.
Amanda: I am going to run in.
Brandon: Is there a ball pit?
Amanda: Maybe that's where the secrets are?
Mike: Is there anything- is there anything else in the room besides the big play-place?
Brandon: Are there large things that are gonna fall down on my head as I enter the entrance?
Amanda: Like scissors?
Brandon: I’m going to investigate for traps!
Eric: [chuckling] Great! Alright.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: Uh, is 6 good?
Eric: Brandon you start looking around the play-place like try to poke at it, like put your foot down and go tap-tap-tap. And then the PA comes on and be like...
Eric (as Dungeon Master): [energetically] I’m a deranged Dungeon Master! There’s obviously traps!
[audience laughs]
[incredulously] Brandon, what did you think was?! Are we just having fun here?
Amanda: He thought it was a pizza coma.
[Eric and Brandon laugh]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Brandon, I also want to say you have sauce on your shirt, which is why I put you in a tracksuit. And then I thought the two other people would look good in a tracksuit, so I put them on for you as well.
Brandon: That's nice, okay.
Mike: Yeah, we look like the Beastie Boys now, so it’s cool.
Brandon: We get to keep these when we win right?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): If you win! You can just wear it for eternity if you lose!
Mike: Can we go inside the play-place?!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Yes, sounds fun for me! I’m just going to watch and put it on Youtube later. Alright y'all, just smash that subscribe button. I'm the Dungeon Master! And I just want you all to know that I'm going to be in Bangor, Maine at the end of this month, just doing a meet and greet!
[podcasters talk over each other in excited incoherence]
Amanda: We are running through, I’ve never run faster in my life.
[Eric laughs]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Listen, I get kind of anxious when I meet new people!
Eric: And you hear it fade away. So you come to 2 doorways that are in front of you. Think about it like…
Amanda: [interrupting] In the play-place?
Eric: Inside of a play-place.
Brandon: Are we standing up or we have to be on our hands and knees?
Eric: As you crawl-crawl through like it was really short when you crawl through, and then you stood up and now like imagine you were in, if you were going to a bathroom.
There's like the men's on one side and the women's on the other side because it was like, 1980. But like one of them, and now there's 2 doors and one has a big “True” on it. And the other one has a big “False” on it. And in the middle, between the 2 doors, is a piece of paper. And this sentence is on the piece of paper, “Some animals can get sunburned”.
Mike: Yeah, that's gotta be true.
Amanda: Yeah, let’s go through the “True” door.
Mike: Mhm, let’s go through the “True” door.
Amanda: Haha! That’s a trick question.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: We walk through the “True” door.
Eric: Uh, guys push through the “True” door and you hear a little bell ding. And nothing happens.
Amanda: Good thing?
Eric: It's a good thing, it’s good.
Mike: Sweet!
Eric: And you hear-you hear some-some stomping happening in the other-in the other room.
Amanda: Ugh.
Eric: And now you're at another set of 2 doors. And again, this is “True” on one side and “False” on the other side. And there's another piece of paper in between the 2 of them. And this one says, “The hummingbird egg is the world's smallest bird egg”.
Amanda: It’s gotta be true, right?
Mike: Ugh, I don’t know anything about eggs! Or birds!
Amanda: Or birds! Hard to say. Uh, lets…
Brandon: If we split up, we can’t all die.
Amanda: That's true. Mike could throw his basketball through one of the doors.
Mike: I could.
Eric: At this point, you hear the sound of like, you know when you turn on a gas stove, and then like the gas comes on and then the fire lights? You hear that noise and it came from behind you.
Mike: Oh!
Brandon: Wow…
Amanda: Let's run through the “True” door.
[Mike makes grunt of uncertainty]
Or throw the basketball through it.
Mike: I’m going, I don’t like back-to-back same answer. I want to say false!
Brandon: It’s gotta be a trick question.
Mike: Yeah, I think false.
Brandon: I think the eggs are bigger than the birds themselves!
Amanda: Alright, you can go first.
Mike: Okay, I'll go through the “False” door.
Eric: Okay, it's just gonna be Mike?
Mike: Yes.
Brandon: No, I'll go with you.
[audience laughs]
Mike: Okay, You two are going to run together?
Amanda: I don't want to be alone, so I will follow.
Eric: Okay, all three. Okay, so all three of you push open the “False” door and you were all stuck in like some really, really gross spider webs? Like the super gross cobwebs? And it’s just like all over the place. And then you hear the lighting-the gas lighting again. And I want all of you to take 4 points of fire damage.
[Mike gasps in reaction to damage]
Because you all get singed on the bottom of your feet from a fire that is now coming in from your feet. You look down and they're like, little holes where fire is coming out of. And you all got a little scorched.
Mike: Okay.
Amanda: Alright. Should we run around to the “True” door?
Brandon: Yeah, absolutely. We run out through the “True” door.
Eric: Yeah, you run through, and when you push through the “True” door, there's another bell and you come to the other si...
Brandon: [interrupting] We also learned something!
[audience laughs]
Amanda: I think we all learned something today.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Sorry that you didn’t all have zoo books as children! It’s not my fault!
Eric: [chuckling] Shout out to Zoo Books!
[audience laughing]
So you now come to another two doors, one is “True”, one is “False”. Except this one, the “False” is on the left, and the “True” is on the right.
Amanda: Oh no!
Eric: And this one, there's another piece of paper which is taped to the wall and it says, “Elephants can eat grains with their trunk”.
Mike: [repeating, thinking out loud] Grains with their trunk, grains with their trunk.
Amanda: No! Trunks are just for drinking!
Mike: Trunks, they-they…
Amanda: They can grab!
Mike: And put it into their mouth.
Amanda: And put in their mouth in a very cute fashion.
Brandon: Right. It's a nose, right?
Mike: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon, Amanda, and Mike: [in tandem]: FALSE.
Amanda: We run through.
Brandon: We go through the “False” door.
Eric: It was the other Dungeon Master, don't look at me like that!
[audience laughs]
Alright, you guys push through the “False” door and you hear the bell again, it goes “ding!”. And then you hear what sounds like a robot voice goes,
Eric (as Robot): [robotically] “I just really want to hug you”. Why won’t anyone come in here and hug meeeeeee?”
[short pause]
Amanda: Keep walking, keep walking. Walk away, walk away.
[audience laughs]
Eric: And you hear over the PA system, “Level one complete!”.
And are you guys are gonna get down on your hands and knees and run through a little tunnel again.
Amanda: Alright, great.
Mike: We do that.
Eric: Uh, [giggles] Mike’s-Mike is learning Dungeon and Dragons! This is perfect.
You now come to a very large ball pit, but instead of a ball pit It is filled with like those foam things from a gymnasium?
Mike: Nice!
Amanda: Yep, yep!
Eric: Yep, those big cubes.
Brandon: Rope swing?
Eric: Yeah, someone definitely - Yeah, there's not a rope swing on this one. Like you know someone like lost a cookie in there and it's like still there.
Brandon: WHERE IS IT?! GIVE IT TO ME!!
Eric: Brandon, if you want to look for the cookie, you can. Um, yeah. So that’s all you see.
Amanda: Is there something across?
Eric: On the other side, yes. There is another like, there's a downslope where you could just like, you know, tumble over and do somersaults down.
Brandon: What's on the ceiling?
Eric: Uh, just, uh, more rubbery balloon stuff.
Mike: Is there a way to walk around or we have to go through this?
Brandon: Wait, rubbery balloon stuff? What?
[everyone laughs]
Eric: Like in a bouncy castle, it’s like the top of a bouncy castle.
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda: It’s like inflatable, yeah.
Eric: Yeah, it’s inflatable.
Brandon: Can you attach a rope to it?
Eric: Why don't you make an Investigation check?
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 4.
[audience chuckles]
I need to stop rolling, what’s the point? I keep getting the same, low numbers.
Eric: Brandon, you look at the ceiling and you're like, “Man, I wish I could do this for my room!”
[Brandon chuckles]
“I want to live in a bouncy castle, that'd be great!”. Um, that's-that’s it.
Amanda: Alright, I'm gonna try to swim across.
Eric: Okay. How are you doing that?
Amanda: I'm going to lower myself, kind of like I’m jackknifing into a pool.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: But, like, holding onto the edge so only like, the necessary parts of me go inside.
Eric: Okay, so Amanda, I want you to make a Strength check to see if you hold yourself on the side of the- of this pit.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: [disappointed] 7…
Eric: Okay, Amanda [giggles] with a 7, it's like you're dipping your toe in and you're just like you’re putting your foot down and down and down and it slips because it's just like a freakin bouncy castle.
Amanda: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Eric: And you fall down all the way through, and you're going to take…
[Eric rolls dice]
…5 points of falling damage.
Amanda: So many!
Eric: So Mike and Brandon, you guys just see Amanda fall through, just fall through. And now Amanda you are - your worst fear, at the bottom of foam pit.
Amanda: Oh, so many GERMS!
Brandon: Is she like, suffocating? What's going on?
Amanda: I mean, I'm gonna try to swim back up to the top.
Eric: Okay, yeah, you can- you can swim back to up to the top.
Amanda: Yeah, I'm just gonna continue on and be like, “Try not to fall, it really sucks!”
Brandon: Okay, well, I'm punk AF, so I'm jumping in cannonball style!
[Mike and Amanda encourage Brandon on]
Do I roll for something?
Eric: Yeah, roll for Athletics.
Amanda: With advantage?
[dice rolls]
Brandon: [excitedly] THAT IS A NATURAL 20!
[everyone cheers, audience claps]
Eric: So Brandon, this is like a skateboard video. It’s like all the sudden you hear Goldfinger. It’s like, [imitating Goldfinger] “GET EM, GET EM, GET EM, GET EM, berm berm berm berm berm!”. And it’s like Tony Hawk Pro Skater and you just like throw yourself into the pit.
Brandon: Yeah. Do I bounce off of the foam and to the other platform on the other side?
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: Sounds right. Sounds right. Parkour.
Mike: I also jump in since it's foam stuff, I do a flip.
Eric: Okay, Mike. Make an Acrobatics roll.
Mike: Oh, are you sure this isn’t Athletics? Alright…
[dice rolls]
Eric: It’s a flip, so…
Mike: 13+2 for a 15.
Amanda: Nice!
Eric: Okay, so it’s a cool flip, [confused] but you still take the fall damage?
Mike: It’s worth it! How much fall damage?
Eric: Uh, you take 6 points.
[Mike makes exasperated sound]
Mike, how much HP do you have left?
Mike: Not a lot.
Eric: What is it?
Mike: 7.
Eric: Oh, nice. Okay, you guys get to – you guys slide down the bouncy slide. And now you see those bouncy things from Wipeout. You know, like, there are those balls that you have to bounce on one, and then the other, and then the other and there were three in a row. And there's this really high ledge where the next door is.
Amanda: Um, is there any other option?
Eric: Uh, no, there's no other option unfortunately.
Brandon: We can just sit for the rest of the time.
Amanda: That's true.
Mike: Just talk.
Brandon: Just talk.
Eric: [imitating podcasters in high pitched voices] So, how are you guys doing? You guys know what you're gonna do on your summer vacation?
Brandon: Discuss the choices we made to get here.
Um, well, I'm not gonna take falling damage, so I'll jump on the ball.
Eric: Alright, Brandon make an Acrobatics check.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: uh, 19!
Eric: Okay, Brandon make another Acrobatics check!
[dice rolls]
Amanda: I’m sensing a rule of three.
Brandon: It’s 8!
Eric: Brandon, make another Acrobatics check!
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 16!
Eric: Okay, Brandon, you bounce from the first one to the second one. The second one goes super awry. but you were able to grab on to the third one and you land on the other side.
Brandon: Nice. Nice. Nice.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: It was really cool.
Brandon: [quietly] Thank you, thank you.
Eric: Yeah, everybody clap for Brandon.
[everyone claps]
Brandon: Yeah!!
Amanda: Now, from the ledge, could he use his headphones to reel us up?
Eric: Yeah, if you want to.
Mike: Can you do that [directed at Brandon] since I'm like, almost dead?
[Mike chants “Go!” repeatedly]
Brandon: Yeah. I’m going to throw my headphone cord out.
Eric: Okay, make a Dexterity roll.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: And we’ll do Strength?
Brandon: [enthusiastically] 19!!!
Eric: And you guys make Strength rolls to see if you can climb up the rope.
Amanda: 19, baby!
[short pause]
Brandon: Mike’s dead.
Mike: [less enthused] 2!!!
Eric: Alright, Mike, you lose your grasp for a moment. Does anyone want to try to grab Mike?
Amanda: Yeah, I’ll try to grab him.
Mike: Thank you!
Eric: Okay, Sleight of Hand.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: [monotone] 6.
Brandon: I mean, I’m going to try too, of course.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 21!!!!
[podcasters cheer, audience claps]
Amanda: He went in two-handed for both of his teammates! Amazing.
Eric: Wonderful. Brandon, you grab Mike before he goes to certain death, and you move on to the fourth level. And now the you had to wade through a ball pit and now…
Brandon: Is it sticky?
Eric: Yeah, it's definitely sticky.
Brandon: Gross.
Mike: Nice.
Eric: There is an American Ninja Warrior wall. It is 15-feet high.
Amanda: Is that just a very tall one?
Eric: It's very tall. It's 15 feet, just literally and you curve up. So you can run up it and then you need to like, jump up and try to grab it.
Brandon: Gotcha.
Amanda: Can I try to pull suction cups from my introvert survival kit?
Eric: Absolutely.
Amanda: They can go through TSA.
Brandon: Do I have a skateboard?
Eric: [giggles] Okay, let’s deal with one ridiculous thing after another.
Amanda: Do I have an advantage? What's my modifier? Oh, it's just luck, right?
Eric: Yeah.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: I got an eight, I'm sorry. What else do I pull out?
Eric: Okay, Amanda, you pull out another banana. But this one is like super brown.
Amanda: [whispers] Damn it.
Mike: I still eat the banana.
Eric: That’s good. Yeah, Brandon, why don't you make a History check?
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 7.
Amanda: This Chuck E. Cheeses was built in 1972.
Eric: He’s like, [imitating Brandon] “Yeah, I like longboards, but I don't know where they are. If I had one, it'd be sick. But I don't, unfortunately.
Brandon: Okay. Does anyone know where longboards are?
[Eric stifles laugh]
I ask my two compatriots…
Amanda: No.
Brandon: I mean, is there a lip to the wall?
Eric: Yes, there is.
Brandon: I can try to lasso it?
Eric: Do it.
Brandon: Okay.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 13? Am I proficient?
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Uh, then, 15.
Eric: Okay! With a 15, you do throw it up there and you’re doing a blind throw, and the headphones wrap around something. You feel like there's a “ting!” and it wraps around, you pull on it, and it is taught.
Brandon: Okay, then I'm going to hold on to the cord and take big steps back and try to run up the wall.
Eric: Alright, make an Athletics check.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: With advantage?
Brandon: 4.
Eric: Ro- I’ll give you advantage.
Brandon: [happily] 18!!!
[everyone cheers]
Eric: Okay Brandon, with an 18, you are able to make it up the warp wall!!
Mike: Nice! Use this! Throw it to me!
Amanda: It’s still there.
Mike: Alright, then I go for the same thing.
Eric: Alright, do it.
[rolls dice]
Mike: Mhm, that is a 10 + 2 for a 12.
Eric: Okay with a 12, you get like halfway up the wall, but you're just kind of just like stuck. And you are hanging off of the headphone cord.
Amanda: I try to give him a boost.
Eric: Okay, why don't you also do an Athletics check?
[dice rolls]
Amanda: [excitedly] Natural 20, BABY!!
[audience claps, podcasters cheer]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Aw, my puzzles are going poorly!
Eric: Yeah, you push Mike up.
Mike: Thank you!!
Amanda: You're welcome.
Eric: And It's very cute. And it's like a loving moment between friends.
Amanda: Great.
Eric: And Amanda is still standing at the bottom.
Amanda: I will try to do it as well.
Mike: And we would put our hands over the edge to try to make it that much easier.
Eric: Absolutely. I’ll give Amanda Athletics...advantage on Athletics.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a 19 + 1 for a non-natural 20.
Eric: Alright, you make it up the warped wall! I'm very impressed.
Amanda: Me too.
Eric: Eric says, and then the PA comes on...
Eric (as Dungeon Master): I’m very impressed! I can't believe you made it through my play-place of fun! And by fun, I mean DOOM.
Brandon: Is that the full title?
[everyone laughs]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): There’s some really bad stuff in there. I don't like it.
Brandon: You made it!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): It’s supposed to be gross, even I don't like it. No one likes it.
Amanda: What is at the top of this wall?
Eric: There is like a balloon arch that says, “You did it!!” but the “Y” in the “You” is popped, so it just says, “ou did it!”.
Amanda: Uh oh.
Eric: And there is a doorway leading out of the play-place area.
Brandon: Almost certainly a trap, let’s go through it.
Mike: Yep.
Amanda: Yeah. How about we do it side by side?
Mike: Yes. How about we link arms?
Brandon: Great.
Amanda: Yes.
[Eric chuckles]
Eric: Alright, everyone make a Dexterity saving throw.
Amanda: Like on the Yellow Brick Road.
[podcasters roll dice]
Amanda: 4.
Mike: 13+2 for a 15.
Brandon: Uh, 12.
Eric: Uh, Amanda, you stumble on the bad carpet and you take 1 point of rug burn damage.
Amanda: Seems gratuitous. But okay...
Eric: This was made for children to run through!
Alright, so you push open the doors underneath the balloon arch, and you look inside and there's just like a really sad birthday party going on.
Brandon: Are there people there?
Eric: That's a great question. So, let me describe the super sad birthday party first. So there's just like balloons that are on the ground it’s… the helium is going out of them. And there's like a spoiled pizza in the middle of the table and you see that there are these hooded figures that are just kind of like walking around the room.
Amanda: [shocked] What!?
Eric: And over the PA system, you hear...
Eric (as Dungeon Master): You did it! Charles Entertainment Cheese is here!
Eric: And then you see this there's like a Time Square ass-looking Charles (Chuck) E. Cheese…
Mike: Oh no…
Eric: …with just a terribly looking costume, just like also like floating around. just walking around the room.
Brandon: Does he have a hood on too?
Eric: Yeah, he also has a hood on. He also has his arms outstretched…
Amanda: Blink twice if you are here against your will.
Eric: Uh, you don't hear anything.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Why don’t you stay for my party?? [short pause] It's wonderful, we’re having such a good time together! The party is great, you have nowhere else to be!
Mike: I approach Chuck E. Cheese.
Eric: Okay.
Mike: And I say, “Yo, What up?”.
Eric: Chuck E. Cheese just runs into you.
Mike: Like physically?
Eric: He just like, bops into you. He takes a step back and then he walks around and then, like, goes around you.
Amanda: Like a Roomba.
Eric: Mike, I want you to make a Perception check and Amanda I also want you to make a Perception check.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: Is it because of my proficiency in Roombas?
Mike: That is a 19.
Amanda: Uh, I got a 7.
Mike: [correcting] 19 +2 for a 21, Just kidding!
Eric: Hey!!
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: Mike you look down and you see the guy that like, there's no feet where the Chuck E Cheese is? He's just kind of like floating where, his Chuck E Cheese robe is down on the ground.
Mike: Okay, guys, this is kind of weird. Uh, I can…I try to remove his Chuck E. Cheese head!
Eric: Okay, so you remove it and there's just like a broom
Amanda: Oh no!
Eric: There is just a broom staring back at you.
Brandon: I actually don't know if this is weird for Chuck E. Cheese or not.
[everyone laughing]
Amanda: I was picturing locusts and that's worse.
Eric: That is worse. That is definitely worse. And you hear the Dungeon Master say,
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Well, I don't have enough friends to come to my party. So I made enough for my own!”
Eric: And Mike you look around and you see that all the robes are floating in this way. So you can see that there are seven different robes. One is matte black, one has sequins, one has polka dots, one has plaid, one has stripes, one has argyle, and one has stars.
Mike: I approach the Argyle robe one.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: Wait, wait, wait, is this all for this puzzle? Just friendship? Does Dungeon Master need friends?!
Amanda: Let's try it.
Brandon: Dungeon Master, do you need friends?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): [pitching unconvincingly] No!
[everyone laughs]
Mike: Didn't sound very convincing!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): No, I definitely don’t need friends! I don't know what you're talking about.
Amanda: What if we start a collaborative role playing game that we play online every Friday night?
[audience laughs]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): No that sounds dumb! I don’t want to do those dumb things!
Amanda: We could really come to depend on each other and trust each other as friends and go to each other's weddings maybe?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Absolutely not! I mean, why would I tell you all these intimate details about myself?
Brandon: Do you want to come to my July 4th barbecue?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): [still not convincingly] No!!! It sounds dumb and bad!
Eric: Uh, Mike, you take off, you go to the guy in the argyle and he runs into you again.
Mike: Okay, I can…I remove the rope.
Eric: Okay, the broom, instead of a broom this time, there's like a punching bag on it? And it just falls on your face. And you take 3 points of damage.
[audience chuckles]
Mike: Geepers!!!!! Cool cool cool cool cool cool…
Amanda: Dungeon Master why don't you let our friend DJ and her friend David go? They can come and join us. That way we’d have more people here.
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Well, they could come but they didn’t want to! They didn’t want to do my fun puzzles. [takes a few quick breathes] It was so fun for me, truly. I love puzzles.
Brandon: Have you considered just inviting people with like invitations and not puzzles to your birthday party?
Amanda: An evite even?
Eric (as Dungeon Master): No, No! That sounds dumb and bad as well.
Eric: Uh, Mike, from your Perception check from before, you see that there is a gold door on the right side of the room.
Mike: Okay, I sneak over towards the gold door.
Eric: Okay. There is a massive keyhole in the gold door.
Mike: Hm, okay.
Amanda: I look under the spoiled pizza.
Eric: It's nasty.
Amanda: No key?
Eric: Actually, Amanda, make a Constitution saving throw.
Amanda: Oh, dang.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: 16
Eric: You are able to hold it together even though it's spoiled and nasty.
Amanda: Great.
Brandon: Is there a cake?
Eric: There is no cake.
Brandon: What-what do you do at a birthday party without cake?!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): [frazzled] It was a good birth- I also wanted to say it’s not my birthday! I just wanted to have a birthday party and I obviously didn’t have the ingredients!
Amanda: Can I tap on the sequined robe shoulder and try to like peek inside the rope?
Eric: Sure make a Sleight of Hand check.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: 11.
Eric: With an 11 you're able to pull the robe off. And it’s just another punching bag and it just kind of falls to the floor.
Amanda: No key.
Eric: So there…
Mike: It didn’t fall on her? Why did it fall on me?
Eric: Because you didn’t do a Sleight of Hand check and it went from the back.
So there is still the matte black, polka dot, plaid, stripes and stars....
Brandon: I'm going to go polka dots? I'm just gonna try to sneak a look.
Eric: A Sleight of Hand check.
Amanda: And I'll try stars.
Mike: And I'll do matte black with the Sleight of Hand!
[dice rolls]
Amanda: 11.
[Mike raspberries in reaction to his roll]
Brandon: 18!
Mike: It’s a 1…[delayed] + 4!
[audience reacts to the dice roll]
Amanda: Nice!
Mike: Phew!
Eric: Mike, you take 2 points of damage
Mike: Cool.
Eric: Brandon, you take the robe off and there's nothing there. Amanda you tap on the Stars guy and there's a guy with very long hair who looks at you and says,
Eric (as Long-Haired Guy): [enthusiastically] The time is over!!! It's been 50 minutes. And you hear the clang clang clang clang clang, as a gate shuts in front of the gold door.
Amanda: NO!!!
Eric (as Dungeon Master): I guess you failed my time, I guess we’re going to be friends [scarily] FOREVER.
Amanda: This is a pretty dark metaphor about friendship, huh?
[audience laughs]
Mike: I limp over since I’m at 2 health points,
[Amanda awws in reaction to Mike’s HP]
Mike: What happened when we took the robe off? There was a guy under one of the robes?
Eric: Yeah the man with the very-very long hair…
Amanda: The stars.
Eric: And he has a key around his neck.
Mike: Okay, I look up at the PA system and I very weirdly say, “Give me a beat!”. Because I want to battle rap this man for his key!
[audience laughs]
Eric (as Dungeon Master): Well, I can try!
[Eric beatboxes]
Mike: I got this guys!
[audience laughs]
Mike: Mm, okay…[takes a deep breath, begins rapping over Eric’s beatboxing]
Look, I’ve got 2 points,
I'm feeling pretty bad.
But... the locked doors,
got me feeling real mad.
And I don’t know,
cause I gotta get glad.
Cause that key around your neck,
I wish I had. In my hand.
This wasn’t the plan, I’m the man.
But it's not going great, I’m on this date.
I’m down two HP points,
and I don’t know,
just what’s the point?
And why are we here?
Who is this dude?
And why is the PA guy so rude?
I just want that key,
put it in my grasp.
Because,
I’ve got a class on the situation.
[Mike ends rap with final statement] Give me your key. Sir.
[audience claps]
Eric: He starts to cry a little bit. And he says...
Eric (as Long-Haired Guy): [aloof] Yeah, man you could have just had it. You could have just asked me. You don’t have to rap at me.
[audience laughs]
Eric: And he gives you the key that is around his neck.
Mike: Okay.
Brandon: Let’s GOO!!
Mike: I give the key to Brandon.
Brandon: Why!?
Mike: I'm not doing anything!
Brandon: I go up to the door and put the key in.
Eric: Okay you put the key in the door and it unlocks the door, but there's still the gate that is down there. And the door swings open and light pours in. But, unfortunately, there's no way for you to get out and you are stuck once again in the Dungeon Master’s Master trap. And that is DDR. Thank you everybody!!
Mike: Wow…
Amanda: Ahh!
