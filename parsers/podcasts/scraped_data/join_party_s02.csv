Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to – oh, what's that? The jingle bells? The holiday party After Party. Wooh!
[Everybody cheering]
Julia: Hey.
Brandon: Wooh! I'm dressed as a reindeer.
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: Did you notice?
Julia: No, but I did notice you're wearing a Spirits shirt and that made me very happy.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: It’s a good shirt.
Amanda: I made an eggnog so I noticed nothing anymore.
Julia: Hahaha.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Do you all want to come around and learn about the meaning of Hanukkah? Here we go.
[Amanda chuckles]
Amanda: Eric, it's weird that you just put on that Rugrats episode every year.
Eric: Listen, that's honestly a lot easier than having to explain it every single year. And that's the only Hanukkah media I need or Ross, the worst canonical person from Friends.
Brandon: Yes.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: I heard you, Brandon.
[Eric snickers]
Brandon: I know about the Maccabees from Ross.
Eric: Ugh!
Julia: But what if Apple just screamed the story of Hanukkah at us every year? Wouldn’t that be nice?
Brandon: I hope he does.
Amanda: That would be nice.
Eric: Here's why we, we eat oily foods. That's why. It's a holiday.
[Julia and Brandon chuckles]
Eric: I brought you jelly doughnuts. Eat it.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: I will.
[Amanda chuckles]
Eric: Sure. Hey, 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Amanda McLoughlin, can we --
Amanda: Oh, no.
Eric: Can you read our question?
Amanda: Yes. Yes. Well, thank you very much, Eric, for gathering these questions into fun named segments as your want.
Julia: Ooh.
Amanda: So, we're gonna start here with Let's Talk about the Holiday Party. That's the first – that's the first, like, overarching segment.
Eric: Do, do, do.
Amanda: And the first subsection --
Brandon: That was a segment break.
[Julia snickers]
Amanda: -- is Taylor Swift swift questions.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Great.
Eric: Yeah, I appreciate that everyone – although we had, like, a massive fight that was – had a lot of resonance towards the story and revealed small crumbs --
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: -- about the larger arc – no, we're just talking about the holiday part.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Listen --
Brandon: You put Taylor Swift in your campaign, that's on you, dude.
[Julia chuckles]
Eric: That’s fair.
Amanda: The people know what they want to know. So --
Eric: I will – I want to tease them with Taylor Swift, but I do want to you three to tell the story much like the story of the Maccabees.
[Julia, Brandon, and Amanda laugh]
Eric: About how the holiday party came together and why we were doing this.
Amanda: Wait. Is Ross Jewish on Friends?
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Ross and Monica are both half Jewish.
Amanda: Fascinating. Didn't know that.
Eric: It’s its only redeeming quality.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: I don’t know if I could say that, but good.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: No, I want – I would love to tell the story of why we did this, which I find very funny. And this is also, like, the relationship of a DM to players --
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric: -- a while, like sessions ago. I think like in the middle of, of Join Me Outside as, like, things were ramping up. This was before the blizzard happened when I was starting to see those things. And you were kind of, like, doing your own things. I'm like, “Hey, all y'all do whatever you want to do. If there's something you want to do or you want to run down, just let me know so that I can put this in there before” – at the back of my head, I was like, “Before the arc really gets going.” And then the three of you talked and you were like, “We have a proposal for you.”
Amanda: Well, I kicked Eric out of the studio and then the three --
[Julia and Amanda chuckles]
Amanda: And then the three of us discussed among ourselves and I was like, “Guys, wouldn't it be funny if we made Eric play, like, 12 NPCs at the same event.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: And, like, one of my siblings showed up and we just had, like, a fun romp of a holiday party.
Julia: Yes. And we loved it because then we get, like, NPC interaction that we don't normally see and stuff.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: And we’re all stoked about that.
Brandon: I just thought it'd be funny that Eric had to talk to himself for an hour. So --
[Brandon and Eric chuckles]
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. It never feels like that in the moment, but then later I'm just like, “Oh, shit.”
Brandon: Yeah, I know.
Eric: There – I, I'm gonna put a pin in that because that actually is a, a thread that's happened throughout the party.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: But the thing – I was asking you for things your characters wanted to do resonant to the story. So, I'm like, “Alright. Fine. They're gonna be able to – they're gonna drive the story forward. I finally get player interaction. Then we’d build out the world.”
[Amanda chuckles]
Eric: And the three of you were like, “We really want a holiday party.”
[Everybody laugh]
Julia: We did.
Amanda: Well, originally, it started for me as, “Oh, that'd be a fun way for more of my siblings to come out of the woodwork because having Quinn around has been super fun.”
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: So, I wanted to, like, bring forth another. But then, immediately, the NPC --
Julia: Menagerie.
Amanda: But then immediately --
Brandon: The menagerie.
Amanda: -- like, menagerie of NPCs --
Eric: [Inaudible 4:04].
Amanda: -- that we’re able to have was more important to me. That was fun for us. Was it fun for you?
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: It definitely was fun for me. I feel like that they were regular people. I feel like I understand the relationship with – between each other. And it also was, like, with intent. If I'm just making jokes, it's fine. I had Taylor Swift and X on the other side. And that was also a really fun thing to bounce off of.
Brandon: Hold on. Eric, you consider Taylor Swift and a talking rabbit as normal average people?
Eric: Well, not even – more like it was just funny in a joke. The other thing I'm remembering is, all the way back in the first campaign when we went to a topless for the first time and Johnny snuck into the meeting between Alonzo and the guy who was running it, who had – who sounded like Tommy Wiseau.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: And that was really difficult because, also, I've been doing this a lot less time. But I was like, “Oh, I need to communicate some, like, secret stuff and, like, plot during it while, like, Johnny's just standing there invisible and not participating.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Eric: And he's going to be taking notes to use against me later as, as it's happening. So, I was thinking about that. And that was incredibly difficult. But this was a lot of fun.
Brandon: I think, yeah.
Eric: Because it was just, like, silly and fun. I'm trying to think of other times where I had to do extended periods of talking to myself.
Amanda: I think, in Bachelorette Party, the, the candidates talk to each other and the narration talks to the candidates pretty often.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: Contestants. Whatever the pronoun is.
Brandon: And like – more like an average afternoon in the office, you know.
Amanda: Yeah.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yeah. I think the other time that it was really difficult was right at the end --
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric: -- when we were doing the – like, all of the speakers of the different city states had to say stuff. That was really difficult --
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: -- especially because I just introduced, like, two new ones.
Amanda: And, oh, like, a final battle where you played, like, five participants and the baddie.
Eric: Yes, though that was all pretty. That was all difficult. Oh, yeah. Where I was the – I was the antagonist and, like, six people in that room --
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah. Mhmm.
Eric: -- plus you two. That was really – that was hard. But, no, this was super fun. I, I – at one point, I don't remember if it made it or not. I was like, “Is this what standup comedy is like?”
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Brandon: I can't remember that made it in either.
Eric: Well, now, they know.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Behind the screen.
Amanda: Well, let's get to fan favorite NPC, Taylor Swift.
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda: We're gonna to start with a comment, more of a question, from Sister Pumpbells on Twitter. I had to physically pause the podcast when Taylor Swift entered the holiday party because I was laughing so hard. Well-timed execution, Eric. Bravo.
Julia: I also had to take a very long pause before I reacted to it.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Brandon: Same.
Julia: That reveal.
Brandon: I think I said, “What?” like 10 seconds after Eric said it.
[Amanda and Brandon laugh]
Brandon: And that was not, like, a joke or, or [Inaudible 6:49]. Like, I was very confused.
Amanda: And I try very hard to suppress my laughter because Eric and I are recording in the Multitude Studio together. So, if I laughed, it would show up on your mic track. And that's not always what we want in the Edit. So, just know that, on the inside, I was like my stomach was clenching because I was just like, “This is so funny. Oh, my god.”
[Julia and Brandon chuckles]
Eric: I really wanted to see it as someone, like, Quinn theoretically would have.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And, like, Saoirse Ronan is probably doing something else. But, like, Taylor Swift is like, “Yeah, I need to have as many holiday parties as possible.”
Julia: That feels right.
Eric: I got these $1,000 reindeer – this $1,000 reindeer headband. I need to use it.
Brandon: Hit me.
Amanda: The Realist on Instagram, Eric, would like to know if you could please sing as Taylor Swift in a future episode.
Eric: Not in a future episode. But I could just like do it right now because Red is a really good album.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. Nice.
Eric: Because loving you is red, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Loving you is red. That’s [Inaudible 7:44].
Julia: You did also do that while we were driving in the car during the blizzard.
Brandon: I was gonna say I think you did do it.
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: Yeah.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Eric: Red is a great album. It's – it’s actually a good album. I'm, like, not a Taylor Swift fan per se because it's, like, too much going on. But I listened to Red all the way through and I thought it was really sick during when – I was listening to it in college.
Julia: I'm a big fan of the newest album, The Folklore.
Amanda: Well, great segue, Julia, because Holly Jessica on Instagram wants to know, “Is the infamous Folklores track, The Lakes, actually based on Taylor's trip to Lake Town City?”
Julia: Haaa!
Brandon: Yes.
Julia: I hope so.
Amanda: I mean headcanon accepted. Sacha Desh on Instagram is saying that they are wheezing over the Entanglement episode. Give us Dr. Morrow and Taylor's interaction, please.
Eric: I don't think they would --
[Eric laughs]
Eric: I feel like, when you have two celebrities in a room, they don't necessarily want to acknowledge each other.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Eric: It's like I'm sitting on different parts of the restaurant.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So, I don't know if they ever would have acknowledged each other, but I definitely think Dr. Morrow would have been like, “Ah, I need to make those boots that make me six inches taller without anybody else noticing.”
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Julia: The boot legs. But I'm --
Eric: Very good job, Julia.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Abigail Speights and many other people asked, “How does Taylor feel about January?”
Eric: Oh, my god, so many people asked this. Taylor Swift is delighted by January, obviously, as everyone does. January was also doing Casey at the Bat a bunch, which was a joke that I love personally. That was very funny.
Brandon: Eric, I had to Google what Casey at the Bat was while I was editing.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: It's like – it's a poem about, like, Americana and baseball that, like, people recite. It's like one of those old, old timey – they’re, like, early 20th century recitation poems about, like, a baseball player who's, like, a mythical player who's washed up and, like, needs to have, like, his final at bat. But I just thought it was funny that this little bunny rabbit would recite it all the time and knew all the words, too.
Brandon: Oh, it's hilarious.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: It's – it’s very correct.
Amanda: It's January's version of me saying The Raven when drunk at parties.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yes, 100 percent.
Brandon: In my headcanon, January learned the Casey at Bat while he was still a non-sentient rabbit. He was just a regular rabbit.
Julia: Mhmm. Mhmm.
Amanda: I just really liked it. Yeah, it’s very rhythmic.
Brandon: It sprung forth with the sentience and spouting of the poem.
Julia: Incredible.
Eric: That sounds about right, for sure. But, yeah, January – I think Taylor Swift took a photo of January. It was adorable. Taylor Swift is now part of the squad, has a Taylor Swift flat card that a bunch of people asked me about. Yeah, January has that. January is like Karlie Kloss. And Cara Delevingne and January all get, like, brunch together now.
Brandon: I also had to ask Lauren about what that was, too.
[Everyone laugh]
Eric: [Inaudible 10:37] – and, Taylor Swift, I know it's not, like, a thing anymore because Taylor Swift, like, went underground and then emerged with Folklore. And --
Brandon: She died, Eric.
Eric: Oh, then she got resurrected by Bon Iver and made the Folklore.
Julia: Mhmm. Mhmm.
Eric: Yeah, for sure. Folklore is about her resurrection, actually.
Amanda: Her time in Christian heaven.
Eric: Yeah. And she was in Christian heaven and Bon Iver is like, “Excuse me. I need to go get her” and brought her back.
Julia: Come back.
[Brandon and Julia chuckles]
Eric: And then Taylor Swift came back and, now, she's a revenant.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: For, for Emmys.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Mickey Bakker asked to, to close out --
Eric: Grammys. For Grammys.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Eric: Shit.
Amanda: To close out Taylor Swift swift questions, Mickey Bakker asks, “Who would impress Aggie if they suddenly appeared at her party?” I think it would be, like, the people from the America's Test Kitchen videos. The really – the really like battleship built lady with the – with the – with the blonde bob --
Eric: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Amanda: -- I feel like --
Eric: She’s the best.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or the people from, like, PJ Harvey from the King Arthur Baking blog. She writes my favorite recipes and, therefore, also, Aggies. I think – or like the Land's End founders, the Carhartt founders. They should be like, “Wow.”
[Julia chuckles]
Brandon: Bridget and Julia, that's who they are.
Amanda: There you go. Well, the thing I was most excited about, in these episodes, is that we have kind of decided on the nomenclature of Entanglements for these kind of interstitial episodes between arcs. So, Eric, do you want to talk a little bit about why we're naming that differently and why this is not just the last episode of Join Me Outside?
Eric: Yeah, this was actually something that I've loved in the adventure zone for a long, long time. Something that is actually what brought Brandon and I together on the first day of our – of the job that Brandon I hate and don't talk about anymore. But, on the first day of that job, Brandon was putting up stuff in like the makeshift studio he was putting together. And he put up a bandana of the Adventure Zone. And I was like, “I just listened to all of their episodes.”
[Brandon chuckles]
Eric: And that's how we became friends. But something that I really like from Balance is that they have the lunar interludes, which they used to do because I think that people don't like listening to level up episodes. But I do like that this is like it's outside of the arc itself. In between arc 1 and arc 2 of this campaign, we had that a little bit where we fought MM. So, I wasn't thinking about it as critically. But, now, I'm like I want an Entanglement episode, which moves the season along. And I really feel like these are – they're different. Just important, but definitely outside of the arc structure that we have laid out for Join the Party. And this is something I wanted to execute on. So, now, there is Entanglement I, which is that last one where Ma – where they fought the Ma mech and then we did the first Entanglements. And, now, we're doing this again, which is the holiday party Entanglements and then speeding into spring.
Amanda: Jamie in Discord asks – I found a really great question about the function that this plays. So, Eric, in your brain space, do the event tables provide a way for the characters to impact the game or narrative but provide enough guide rails to keep the story moving along the path you've set out? And any thoughts on allowing the characters to use the plot points or complications device to bring more story options into the game? And, players, I think we can answer this, too.
Eric: Yeah, I want to throw this over to y'all because I came up with this fun thing just to give you, you all more stuff to do. So, I, I – how do you all feel, like, about the table? Because I think that, originally, in, in things that are made by Wizards of the Coast, it’s very, like, flat. And it’s like, “Oh, I don't know what to do. Here. Now, you're fighting 10 goblins.”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Because the table told me to. So, what do you think? And how are you responding to the table itself?
Julia: I personally really enjoy it because I like to see the supervillains that your brain comes up with.
Brandon: Yeah.
[Eric chuckle]
Julia: That's the biggest selling point for me. I also like the idea of facing challenges that aren't just, “Hey, beat this guy up,” you know.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Mhmm.
Julia: Which is usually how Val solves problems --
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: -- but is trying to do new ways of solving issues.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: If Val – if Val does that, they'll get half a level of level up.
Julia: Yeah, I know --
Brandon: I like that.
Eric: [Inaudible 14:37].
Julia: Listen, I tried to do it with the most recent one with the guy at the coffee shop, but it just didn't work.
[Brandon and Eric chuckle]
Julia: I just rolled the bad.
Eric: That's true.
Brandon: That’s what I like most about it because, in the first one, I, I rolled poorly and then Julia rolled poorly. And, like, they don't have, like, major effects. Like, it's not like we're, like, you know, disowned by the superhero community. But it's really interesting to see those things come back in the actual, like, plot-driven episodes. I think that's really fun.
Amanda: Yeah, I enjoy that it, it lets me do my favorite part of combat, which is kind of fight strategy and figuring out --
Brandon: Mhmm.
Amanda: -- like, what of my repertoire and arsenal would be the best match for the situation and, you know, had the least, like, civilian impact without the – actually needing to, like, go through the rolls and the punching, like, taking a long time, which is also fun in a different way. But I, I like that kind of speed option. And, for me, it was really fun to world build in that way. Particularly, I think, our first time using the Entanglements table, it was really fun to just get a sense of, like, the other people and villains that are in Lake Town City and also different locations. Like, going to the light rail for the first time was really, really cool.
Eric: I really love the stuff that you all rolled in this one. This was very fun. And, like, your, your relationship with – with paid – with the bear – the cowboy and the bear --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- was my favorite.
Julia: Incredible The thing that I rolled on there was his – the conflict was MLM.
[Brandon, Julia, and Eric laugh]
Eric: So, this is – this is what – it was fake bills. And you're like, “Do you have a permit?” It was so funny.
[Amanda and Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Thank you. JCBOS on Instagram would like to know if there's an option for a recurring villain encounter. But what I'm really asking is will we ever see the grand return of the ever Resplendent Emperor.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. So --
Brandon: God, I hope not.
Eric: This is – I'm sorry to say Brandon, but, yes, 100 percent. There are – I have put on the table chances to see these people again who have not been locked up. So, the Emperor is on the table. It just didn't happen.
Amanda: And, same but different, Michelle Spurgeon – I think we have to give Michelle a – like a question asker name because she really comes through with great questions. So, maybe like Michelle, the Spurgeon – the Spurgeon sturgeon. I don't know. I'm just thinking about this here.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Hmm.
Eric: Question, Question Surgeon Michelle Spurgeon.
Brandon: There we go.
Amanda: I like that.
Julia: Write that down.
Amanda: That’s so good. Anyway, Question Surgeon Michelle Spurgeon.
Eric: The, the doctor.
Amanda: The doctor says, “Will the upcountry keepers ever try to take on any of the villains we see in the Entanglements?”
Eric: Yes. So, this is another thing. The whole reason the Entanglements exist is because I want to flesh out the world when we're not doing the actual arc. So, there's stuff happening all over the place. And I think that, as we get into the arc that's coming up – also, get fucking – hold on to your pants guys for the next few episodes that are coming out. But --
[Eric laughs]
Julia: I’m just stressed out by the episodes that are coming out.
Amanda: Julia, just, like, sat back and put her hands behind her head. Like, “Oh, no.”
Julia: Oh.
Eric: But things happen when you're not interacting with it. So, 100 percent. They are fighting, like, the ambient crime as well.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: That's – that's why you're an Indie man.
[Julia chuckles]
Eric: Ambient crime. But, yeah, I will --
Julia: That’s my favorite genre of music. Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: That’s what Spotify told me my top genre was for the year. Yeah.
Eric: Brandon, you saw them open for Vampire Weekend in the Knitting Factory, right?
Brandon: I did. Yeah. It was a terrible show.
Eric: Yeah, very good. Yeah, it was pretty bad.
Brandon: They stole my wallet.
Julia: Weird.
Eric: They said – they said it would start at 9:00, but it started at 12:12.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So, stuff is happening around which I think was something established. So, yeah, it's – that's on the table. I actually had – one of the things on the table is the running into the upcountry keepers while you're fighting something. It just didn't happen. So, all of these things are on the table. I, I refresh them in a way just to replace – sometimes, I replace big things when they're – I don't want you to fight this person anymore. Like, there was something – I've been watching all of Teen Titans lately. I ran through all of it, because I missed it so much, just over Thanksgiving. I loved it. There is an episode with the character Melvin, which is a Russi’s original to the Teen Titans TV show, who is, like, a six year old who has, like, a giant imaginary friend. And I wanted them as a villain that went in [Inaudible 18:45 - Krimpston] after our good friend, [Inaudible 18:46 – Rick McGario]. And I wanted you to deal with that, but, now, I feel like you're a little too over leveled for that. And that – now, [Inaudible 18:52Krimpston] is not going to be out there anymore.
Brandon: Hmm.
Eric: So, like, I just refresh it for the most fun things, especially now that you have relationships. We're gonna have Killer Jeff might – Painkiller Jeff might show up again and show what the professor. So, all of that is still on the table.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: The, the Resplendent Emperor, I called him the professor because that's what he is. He had – he had --
[Eric laughs]
Julia: No, the professor is the man I beat up at the hockey stadium.
Eric: Oh, yeah. He was one with the tablet. That's right. No, he was a professor of Asian American – of Asian Studies --
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: -- at CLTC. Right.
Amanda: Ah.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Ah, yeah. And, to close out our Entanglements corner, Bray asks, “Do you plan on completely switching out the charts between arcs or just kind of updating them to fill in numbers that were taken?
Eric: Yeah, I am filling it in just for – Bray, I just I looked at your question. No, that's what I was talking about. So, yes, I fill it in to make it as, as fun as possible. But I was like I'm totally fine if we don't do things. It's – you know, it's whatever happens and whatever you run into. Brandon, also, yours was really good. I really liked yours.
Brandon: The actuary?
Eric: Yeah, the one with the actuary.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: Because the thing that I rolled was it was Dr. Morrow’s house, the actuary. And it's a prank. It wasn't happening. So --
Brandon: Yeah, I, I know I did not expect that in any way. Like, I did not expect it to be an actual prank. But I love that the solve was like, “It's fine.” Like, just ignore it.
Julia: I distract you.
Eric: I just – but, like, that was – I love the constellation of that. It was like you could talk about someone who knew about death.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: And that's your specialty.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: So, I thought that that was really sweet, especially tying in to the whole thing with the locket and itself and Dr. Morrow feeling rather vulnerable. Then I was just like, “Oh, shit, this is perfect.” I have no idea what it is. This is truly a table. Like, I've written all of them, but they need to fit together. I love that moment for you.
Brandon: Yeah, it was great.
Amanda: I love the bear x MLM crossover.
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Brandon: I always feel like I'm in The Incredibles when we do the Entanglements because, like, those --
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: -- that feels like those kinds of supervillains, you know.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: So fun.
Eric: Yeah, definitely.
Amanda: I just – I love when our campaign feels like a comic book montage.
Eric: Hmm.
Amanda: It's just so fun.
Eric: Hmm.
Julia: It totally is.
Amanda: All right. Our, our new subcategory in our new corner is Milo and His Friends Corner.
[Julia chuckles]
Amanda: Brandon, just various sundry questions here, “Are Apple and Zak kissing?” for example. Tara Santoro wants to know.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Anybody?
Julia: Yes. Yes.
Brandon: I think it’s alright.
Julia: 100 percent yes.
Eric: No, no, no.
Amanda: Milo, why would you --
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: -- what – Milo is like, “Why would you say that?”
Eric: I, I – so, again, I'm going with the Scott Pilgrim approach on this for Milo, which I think that Brandon and I have established, which is that, in Scott Pilgrim, he has no idea that, like, one of his friends is gay the entire time. And I think that Milo just doesn't know when romantic things are happening around him.
Brandon: He's totally oblivious.
Eric: Totally oblivious. Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. So, Desmond asks if Lucas and Milo will be together next season. Milo's like, “Huh? What do you mean? Where'd you get all this?”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: It's not even a question of --
Amanda: Is that right?
Eric: -- whether or not they have feelings for each other. It's I don't think Milo would even know if it was happening.
Brandon: Totally.
Julia: I really appreciate Milo representing useless lesbians who don't know when they're on dates.
[Everyone laugh]
Amanda: It's a real queer mood to, like, maybe potentially be able to date all your friends at the same time and never do. But, listen, I think it's important to us to, like, leave enough kind of room and foothold and ambiguity in our characters for people to identify. Like, if that's how you see yourself or see the characters, like, that is what headcanon is. That is what Fanon is. And, like, that is totally on you guys to, like, run with and play with. And, for us, I think playing out romance is not a priority in this campaign despite the fact that both, both Val and Aggie had, you know, vague romantic interests from pretty early on.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: That's not, like, center stage in our narrative.
Brandon: Totally.
Amanda: So, you know, y'all have fun. We enjoy that you ship it. We enjoy that you have fun and see yourselves or your, your fellow friends. But, um, that's on you.
Eric: But, you know --
Brandon: The meme.
Eric: -- if all the – if all of the – if all of the players really want to have some, like, explicit sex scenes --
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: -- then we can all participate.
Julia: I’m good actually.
Amanda: I think that's not what we meant by the fuck cut and you know it.
[Brandon, Julia, and Eric laugh]
Brandon: Eric, I really want have an explicit sex scene. Sorry, you brought it up. Let's do it.
Eric: All right. Eric and Brandon explicit sex scene.
Amanda: Hang on. X card, Julia, what’s your say?
Julia: X Card. Red, red card.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Julia: I will say though I do think that, like, as a whole superhero genre relies heavily on, like, people's relationships outside of their powers, whether or not that is romantic or not is up to us to decide.
Eric: Mhmm.
Brandon: Right. Totally.
Julia: I will also say that, while I, as Julia, me and myself, totally ship Milo and Lucas, I understand the need in media to represent, like, healthy male relationships with good boundaries.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: That’s one of my, like, stalwarts in life. Every time I see a shitty example out on TV, I'm just like, “Why can't they just be good? Why can’t they be good?”
Julia: Why can’t they be better?
Amanda: I say to Eric all the time men talking about their feelings --
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: -- because it's so rare to see.
Eric: I – yeah. No, that's why I cared about that more. I think it was just funny. This Apple and Zak Rose’s “relationship” was a joke, where I was like, “Well, you made a bad perception check. So, like, they might be kissing next to the [Inaudible 24:08].”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: But, yes. No, I care about that so much more. And I think that the relationship between Milo and Lucas now that's growing is much more important about, like, trust and telling each other things and, like, just between two male friends.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I don't necessarily see them as dating. I don't think Lucas would even think that, that. I don't know. This is weird because I control the brain of the character. And I get that all the characters.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So, what I will say is I feel like this arc really – I agree with Julia 100 percent. This arc set up a lot of stakes of relationships that everybody has here that I might prod on and villains might prod on as they know that you have friends and family that you care about. And I think that's really important. But, yeah. No, I think that the story between Milo and Lucas that played out during the party, I think, is really important. And that's gonna be something that we're going to touch on a lot I'm sure.
Brandon: I think also, with Milo and his dad, too, like, I love that relationship --
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: -- as well. Having a healthy, like, parental relationship and one that doesn't cross friendship boundaries in an inappropriate way, but, also, that’s, like, supportive and encouraging and emotionally available there is, is really important to have in media, too.
Julia: Hell yeah.
Amanda: Great question on this topic from Fennel Sauce on Twitter. Did Milo kind of low-key want Lucas to figure out his superhero identity? Was there a small part of him thinking, if he sees through this, it would maybe not be the worst thing ever?
Brandon: Sees through this. Very nice. Good job.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Brandon: Of course.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: Like, Milo – if Milo didn't think it would get him killed and all his friends killed, he would tell everyone.
Julia: Yeah.
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon: He wants to be a famous superhero more than anything else, like, for sure.
Eric: The funny thing is that, Brandon, we talked about how the, like, Spider Man and Ned relationship from the newest Spider Man movies.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: And that was what Fennel was referring to at the end of the tweet, too. He’s like, “Yeah, that's what – I feel like we're getting close to that. And I love that.”
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Totally. Well, as all of us recover from thinking about the emotional availability of our childhoods, I’m gonna go into the kitchen and get more vegan eggnog. Be right back.
[Brandon and Brandon chuckles]
Julia: Eggnog.
Midroll Music
Eric: Hey, it's, Eric. Buying presents is one of my favorite things to do. And, even though it's not actually part of any sort of religious holiday, you know, put into my actual one, the way that Hanukkah kind of accepts that from Christmas is one of my favorite things to do. Finding something that is representative of what a person thinks they like but doesn't even know they like and one buy for themselves or wouldn't even know about it is a joy. It represents that you know them maybe a little bit better than they do or, at least, to some degree. And it's nice. Now, I know a lot of you out there might not like doing this because it's a lot of pressure. But I have faith in you. This is such a wonderful thing to do. And you can make someone feel so good. And I believe you. Welcome to the Midroll. I got you one of those silicone pebble ice things so that you can make more drinks. I know you'd like that. Hello to our new patrons; Bailey, Grant, Elise, Jeff, Jenny. Soshell, Heather, Laura, Teeva, JayPaul90, Flo, Feyo, Angie, Charlotte, and Simon.

I want to tell you about a wonderful thing that I wrote with our very own Julia Schifini in a special Join the Party-Spirits crossover event, The Cool Cryptid Compendium. This is a system agnostic manual with stats and descriptions of 20 different creatures from folklore from around the world. D&D is built around monster slaying, but, a lot of the time, you don't want to kill the monster. And what even makes a monster in the first place? Why should we build adventures around killing it for glory in gold? So, in the Cool Cryptid Compendium, these creatures are, like, strange and wondrous NPCs you can put in to dot your world. They have likes and dislikes, personalities and goals. They are complex and require more than hacking and slashing to interact with. No matter what gaming system you use, you'll get inspiration for these characters that are way more than just a big bad. This would be perfect to slot into a monster of the week campaign. Or you need a fun mythical NPC or villain for your mass campaign, it would work anywhere. It's also so beautiful with the illustration and design by the lovely, Zoe Polando Ryder. You got to check this out. It’s gonn be wonderful for you or all of your monster-loving friends that you would get them for their holiday fun. That is at, exclusively, jointhepartypod.com/merch. We are sponsored this week by BetterHelpw a secure online counseling service. Here's the thing. That bone witch, the one that rolls the bones with the bird bones and all that, she just doesn't understand what I'm talking about. I'm trying to talk about my lived experience. How some people don't – aren't validating and I really need that. And I'm just really in a tough spot right now. And she just keeps rolling the bones and say, “A blood moon is going to come.” And I need something else. That's why I'm turning to BetterHelp. They connect you with licensed counselors through the secure app, letting you message with your therapist, and schedule life phone or video sessions. You can also message your counselor in between sessions if you're worrying about something or if you think of a topic you want to cover in your next call.

Theme Music
Amanda: Alright, guys. Our cups are refilled. And I want to just give us a little aperitif question, which is not a question and a comment, from out of Cole Techs on Twitter. Listening to the Christmas party, if a superhero name for Quinn hasn't been decided, I'd like to throw Cohesion into the deliberation mix.
Eric: Ooh.
Julia: That is so much better than every sticky name we’ve come up with so far.
Amanda: Better than, than Lil Sticky?
[Eric laughs]
Julia: Or Stickoms.
[Brandon and Amanda laugh]
Eric: Sticky Hands.
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon: I'm sorry. But Quinn has decided that Sticky must be in the name. So, it's got to be Sticky Cohesion.
[Eric and Amanda laugh]
Amanda: I just thought that was great. Thank you.
Eric: Cohesion is a great name. I don't think Quinn is, has, is, has the ability to stay stuck on being a superhero for long enough to get a codename.
Julia: Fair.
Eric: So --
Julia: Fair and valid.
Eric: Yeah, but I love that. I think that's great.
Amanda: Well, here's just a grab bag of awesome random questions. Thank you, guys. You really came through in particular for this AP. And we love how many questions we're getting these days, particularly from Instagram. So, just a question I had in my notebook harkening back to Episode 17, Eric, can you tell us about the Gollum mechanics?
Eric: Oh, the Gollum box. Yeah, I wasn't exactly sure when I was going in there. I knew that it – whatever you wanted to do, you know, I have the mechanics of putting together. Like, if you want to make a figure or a conjuration, it was going to be, like, conjure elemental. But you wanted to do it in this different way. And then I just made the following – so, the mechanics of the museum falling down was that, if we got, like, hit the walls or hit, like, three or four or five times, then it – the whole thing would come down and y'all need to get out of there. So, the Gollum just negated one of those if it made strength rolls. And I'm just like, “DC15” bing, bang, boom. I thought that that was incredibly innovative. And that's why I gave you the, the level up which is, like, some, some inspiration. So, I thought that was really great. It was also something I've been thinking about since you first walked into Dr. Morrow’s office. Like, she had a tiny Gollum box --
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: -- on her – on her desk. And I was like, “Oh, this is a great item. I will – I need to use it.
[Brandon and Eric laughs]
Eric: I learned so much.
Brandon: I can't believe you wanted Milo to be unemployed. What the hell.
Eric: Listen, if a – if a Gigabear that hate – that hates the building wants to destroy it, then that's what happens.
Brandon: Do you remember the great gigabear incident in podcasting in 2016 where the gigabear just started all the podcasting for a bit?
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: Oh, no, I don't.
Julia: Sounds nice.
Brandon: And we lost our jobs.
Eric: Oh, that's right.
Julia: Can I ask a question about the museum fight?
Eric: Sure.
Julia: Were there other mechanics – like, other items we could have used during the fight besides the Gollum box in the museum?
Eric: Oh, shit. Let me get my --
Julia: And besides the robot.
Brandon: Oh, yeah.
Eric: All right. I have pulled up my notes from this fight. I actually just wanted to let you, guys, kind of do whatever you wanted. I wanted to put the stuff in the lobby. So, there was the stuff in the lobby you can interact with. But, hey, I did not know that there was a robot in the museum --
Brandon: I know.
Eric: -- hanging out. But we have --
Brandon: Thank you for giving that to me.
Eric: Yeah. But Milo looked for it. It, theoretically, would be there. It, obviously, goes beep, boop because robots go beep, boop.
Amanda: I don’t think so.
Julia: Every single one.
Eric: Which was a – which was a gift for me. And I thought that that was just really smart. So, I wanted to give you things that were around there. I do have specific notes that are around – so, the walls had a 10 damage threshold with an HP of 25. Damage threshold means you have to go over 10 or it doesn't work. This usually happens for constructs. Four walls down means that the buildings started to collapse and you had one round to get out of there. I did have the model drones. The drones that were sent – were sent in. That was something that would happen about, like, a round two if Gutenberg thought that things were breaking bad, which it did because Julia was punching the shit out of that bear.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: Here's something I wanted to talk about. I wrote down that Lucas is a commoner. He has plus one to intelligence and that's it. He has an HP of 10.
Julia: Geez.
Eric: In my head, I was like, “No, that's not fair. He, he's a little bit better. I'll give him HP of 11.”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: And Milo rolled eight. And that – oh, you would have killed Lucas.
Julia: You would have killed your friend.
Brandon: Okay. Excuse me. I did not.
Julia: Not on purpose, but you would have.
Brandon: Hmm, I did not kill anyone. This was – you made this roll for Lucas on HP. And then you took Lucas – his HP away from him. It is all on you, sir.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: I own --
Brandon: [Inaudible 37:12] that. It was a roll on the – on the thing
Eric: But – you know, but you rolled max. You had to roll a D10 and you rolled a 10, which was a – you did the --
Brandon: Oh, yeah, right.
Eric: It was you. You suck. You gain HP from every person within, like, 20 feet of you as you pull energy from them. And that's why you got the HP bonus. And then you rolled.
[Amanda chuckles]
Eric: And then I told you to roll a D10 depending on what – how much you got from each person. And then you rolled a 10. And I'm like, “Oh,” and I wrote down and I'm like, in my head before, I was like Lucas has 11. And then when you did it, I'm like, “Huhhhh!”
Julia: Fucking gone.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: This brings me to a question I want to ask you, Eric. When I was editing the, this episode, I wrote a note in my notes app that just has APQ's. It has one bullet point. In all caps, it says, “ERIC, ARE THERE ACTUALLY ANY GOOD OUTCOMES ON THIS SPIRIT SEARCH TABLE?”
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: There are good outcomes. You've gotten a few of them. Like, you won – there was one you got the big – the big fists you got.
Julia: That's true.
Brandon: Well, that’s true. That’s true.
Eric: That was one. You've definitely gotten some other ones. I will say that I changed them according to, like, how I think your relationship with the ghost is going.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: So, like, sometimes you have better ones. Sometimes, you don't. Sometimes, it's – they are neutral. Most of them are neutral. But then you were put in a terrible situation --
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: -- where it doesn't help. Like, they, theoretically, could have been really helpful. It just so happens that three of your friends were standing by.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: That's true. That's true. I guess that's true.
Eric: Yeah. So, that's just – that's just what happened – what happened there. But, yes, I promise there are good ones on there. I promise.
Brandon: I'll relate it back to Editing Brandon later then.
Eric: Well, let him know.
Julia: Cool. Cool. Cool.
Eric: For those of you asking, I used the gorilla scout stats. I have this, this big – this big thing that I always pull from, which is this wonderful NPC Compendium using classes and subclasses for players. So, I used Gorilla scout stats for Quinn as she was running around. Here's what happened. The big – the big shot that happened for Vulcani, Vulcani got thrown through a wall or thrown through a window.
Julia: [Inaudible 39:13].
Eric: And that was a reaction that the person who texted – who texted them would ask if they needed help.
Brandon: Hmm.
Eric: That's another thing.
Julia: Sweet.
Eric: And then I wrote down, specifically the stuff for the drones that they can do. Yeah. And the shot was, was actually the spell lightning bolt, which I – we’ve seen --
Brandon: Oh, cool.
Eric: -- coming out of a big energy cannon.
Julia: Nice.
Eric: And, also, yeah, who knows what would have happened if you clicked the key chain.
Brandon: Goddamnit, Eric.
[Brandon, Julia, and Amanda laugh]
Julia: We'll never know.
Amanda: Ah, it's very high stakes.
Julia: We would have gotten sushi.
Brandon: Wanted a good sushi. Yeah.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: The guy with a delivery uniform would have given you sushi.
Amanda: Radiant heating was turned on under all Lake town City roads.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Hmm.
Brandon: I need you to confirm to me, Eric, that we did correctly get that. One of them does actually get sushi.
Eric: Here are the ones that you've pushed. Yellow is power. Blue, I've written – I've written down here. I can – if you want to confer, I'm trying to see if I can --
Amanda: I don't – I don't – I don’t believe you.
Eric: Blue, a lot of sushi is delivered to the office.
Brandon: Okay. Good.
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: That's like – it’s like one of those Amazon buttons --
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: -- where you get Tide pods. It's like that but for sushi.
Amanda: Oh, my goodness.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Julia: Incredible.
Eric: Yes, that is in my notes.
Amanda: Question, Julia, from Addo in Discord, as an NBA, it makes me so, so, so happy that nobody misgenders, Val. But I was wondering how everyone knows how to gender Vulcani properly.
Julia: I have a twofold answer to this. One is in canon and one is kind of, like, background mechanic stuff. The background mechanics answer is we don't want to represent misgendering in our podcast.
Amanda: Right.
Julia: Ad the in canon kind of joke answer is I imagine Vulcani just yells their pronouns whenever they arrive on the scene.
[Everyone laugh]
Julia: Either that or just, like, everyone in Lake Town City is very good about asking for personal pronouns before talking about people.
Amanda: Listen, if we are making a fantasy world --
Brandon: Exactly.
Amanda: I might as well be a fantasy world but no misgendering.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Exactly. Yeah, this is a good – this is a good world, minus all the supervillains, you know.
Julia: Yeah, besides the supervillains.
Amanda: A very sweet question from Silca Russ via email, who is 10 years old, “Starting a D&D podcast, I'd love some advice to make it. I'm a first time DM. My friend is a first time player. Do you have any advice?”
Eric: First of all, you're – you're adorable. Thank you so much for listening to us.
[Brandon and Eric chuckles]
Eric: I think, at this point, if you're just – you're just doing it and you're 10 years old, like, just remember it's a game. Have fun. Like, may, may do interesting things that impress both the DM and your player. Like, do – and build a story. Like, do it – do it together. I think it's both the responsibility of the DM and the player to hold the responsibility of telling the story together. And that's really the core of what we're doing here.
Brandon: Yeah, maybe get a parent or older sibling to worry about the tech stuff so you can just focus on having fun --
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: -- because that's the most important thing. It’s having fun.
Julia: Unless you're really good at tech stuff, I don't know.
Eric: Unless you're super genius. Are you a super genius? Are you, like, Tony Stark?
Amanda: Is this Dr. Mayor Morrow pass but in the future?
Julia: Haaa.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Maybe.
Brandon: Pre-doctor.
Amanda: Maybe, you are, Silca. And then, at the end of the email, would Inara become friends with Aggie, Tracy with Milo, or Cole with Val? I think yes for Inara and Aggie. Totally.
Julia: Cole and Val, I could see. Yeah.
Brandon: I would love to see Cole and Val in a wrestling ring. Are you kidding me? Oh, my god.
Julia: It’d be so much fun.
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon: I don't know if Milo and Tracy would get along.
Amanda: No, Brandon, that's the wrong answer.
[Everyone laugh]
Amanda: I think Milo would find Tracy fascinating. I don't know if Tracy would want to hang out with, with Milo.
Brandon: I think they're too – like, they're – they have too similar mindsets, you know. Like, they're – it's like similar to repel kind of thing.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Well, harkening back to Campaign I as well, Jenn in Discord ask the question that made both Eric and I go, “Oh, yeah, that's right,” which is, in Campaign I, what the hell was Oatcakes backstory? How did she get away from [Inaudible 43:07]? Why was she in Fidapolis, et cetera???
Eric: What?
Julia: We never did answer.
Amanda: No.
Eric: What I love about this was just you all were not interested in Gordon Lightfoot – Lighthammer.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Which I think is totally fine because he was a doofus so I could use my rally wrestler voice. But, yeah, I think that – I think that Oatcake was just his dog. And that Oatcake ran away at one point. I, I had a larger backstory written, but it never – it just never came out. So, I had this idea because of the boxing and it was like part of his shtick. And, like, Oatcake was like a show dog and all this stuff. So, it wasn't a great relationship that they had. It was a real Air Bud situation, but, instead of a, a clown, it was a wrestler.
Julia: Of course.
Amanda: Mhmm. Mhmm.
Eric: And, yeah, I just – you weren't really interested in it. So, it just never really came up.
Brandon: A real Air Bud situation is the title of my autobiography.
[Everyone laugh]
Amanda: I do like Air Bud rules as a – just like shorthand that people our age know.
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: Yeah, as long – if it's – if it’s not in the rulebook, then it's not a rule.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Amanda: Charlotte asked via email, “What got you into D&D? And were there any games that specifically started you up? I'm new to D&D, but realize, listening to your pod, that my friends and I have been playing kind of simplified DNA in the form of just, like, a storytelling game.
Eric: That's fun. Um, I think this is such a fun question about, like, they use games for storytelling reasons and just like thing – like, folk games, just to tell a story. I remember a while ago – I don't even remember how this started. I used to do a thing with my friends called Scenario or Scenario, but my friend, Hetty, calls it Scenario.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: That’s, obviously, how you pronounce it. And it was just like someone would tell me, like, a genre or something that we wanted all of our friends to be involved in. And I would just tell that story. It wasn't really a game. They just told me to do it and then I did it, which I loved.
Brandon: Have you played the, the car ride game where you, like – you do – I forget if it's like a sentence or a paragraph, but then you just like round robin it and, like, build the story that way?
Eric: No.
Amanda: Oh, that’s fun.
Eric: That’s fun.
Brandon: Yeah, someone starts with a prompt and then you guys just go like, “This happened and then this thing happened.” Oh, it's cause and effect. So, you have to do a cause and then an effect and then a cause and then an effect and then a cause and effect.
Eric: Oh, I love that.
Amanda: Oh, that's really --
Julia: That is neat.
Amanda: That’s really cool.
Brandon: Yeah, it’s fun.
Amanda: I can see that happening in an Entanglement episode or something like that.
Eric: Yes. Oh, that does actually sound really nice. Yeah. No, I, I was thinking about folk games and storytelling like that.
Amanda: Yeah. And I, I think what's fun is saying, you know, “Oh, like, of all of our friend group, who would be what role in a heist?”
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: Like, that's kind of scenario. That's kind of what we're talking about. And I think that's great. Like, for me, the first time I, I role played in gaming really was playing Betrayal at House on the Hill with you, Eric.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: And you guys were like, “Oh, yeah, we like to sort of, like, voice the characters, you know, and just, like, role play it a little bit.” And I was like, “Oh, that's right. You could just do that. Yeah.” And it was a really – not approachable necessarily, but, like, just a way that allowed my brain to get a little bit silly and be a little bit vulnerable and, like, play, you know, an eight-year-old, like, Boy Scout without feeling like, “Oh, my god, I am, you know, on mic playing a character because that's my introduction to D&D as a player.”
Eric: You really liked being Ox Bellows.
Amanda: I love Ox Bellows, man.
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda: Ox Bellows for life
Julia: I'll also say, in terms of like collaborative storytelling, I was super into, like, forum-based role play. Like, text based. [Inaudible 46:30].
Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Amanda: That’s why I said role playing games because both Julia and I, like, role played on Neopets and Gaia online in various places since I --
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: For me, I was, like, nine. I was too young.
Julia: Yeah, I was gonna say, like, 10 probably. Something like that.
Amanda: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Brandon: I love that.
Amanda: Someone asked me yesterday how I learned to start a business and I was like, “I don't know. I sold, like, CSS skins for, for, for profiles on Neopets.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Yep.
Amanda: 20 year – like, 15 years ago.
Julia: Yes, you do.
Brandon: I started – I like – I think everyone kind of does this, right? Like, I think all kids do. So, when I was – if you have siblings, at least. Me and my siblings used to play like – just sort of, like, role playing games as, as kids. Like, I remember we used to play orphans as a game where we would pretend our parents had passed away.
Julia: Oh, cool.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: We, we --
Amanda: Connor and I would actually play scientist where he was a scientist. And I was --
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: I don't know. Like, a – maybe just like a friend, but, like, it was really fun.
Brandon: Yeah.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: That was so fun.
Brandon: We just kind of do those things.
Eric: I like --
[Eric laughs]
Eric: I have two questions. One, Brandon, what did your parents think about that? Huh?
Brandon: They think it's funny.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Amanda, why were you just a friend to the scientist?
[Everybody laughs]
Amanda: I don’t know. I’m mixing things up. There was another one where I like to play a turtle where I just hid under the blanket.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: So, I'll have to – I’ll have to ask Connor and get back to you.
Eric: Alright. Write down, “Why was I the friend of the scientist?”
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Julia: Do you want to hear the sad only-child version of that? You just do it by yourself.
[Everyone laugh]
Eric: Oh, my god. I love that.
Brandon: I think, like role playing games in D&D, it’s just an excuse for adults to be able to do that again without, like, fear of judgment.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: It's nice.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah. Who would have thought the Dungeon and Dragons was supposed to be fun?
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Who would have thought?
Julia: Wild.
Amanda: Eric, you mean it's not about recreating World War II?
[Eric laughs]
Eric: Yeah, it’s about combat and fighting and murder.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Rowan asks a random question during Episode 18. Is Milo afraid of the dark?
Brandon: I wonder where that came from. Um, I don't think so. Um, I honestly haven't thought about that much to be – to be honest because I don't think there's been a lot of, like, in-game experiences where Milo is, like, in the dark – like, pure dark.
Amanda: And then the second part of the question, conveniently, was what are the PCs and NPCs afraid of.
Brandon: Hmm.
Amanda: Not like existential fears but more kind of tangible or physical ones.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: I mean Aggie is afraid of black eyes. You can't see it coming. You can't predict it.
Julia: Of course.
Amanda: Chaotic.
Julia: Such a --
Brandon: 100 percent.
Julia: Such a like – god, like, useful fear to have.
[Amanda and Julia laugh]
Eric: Dez does not like spiders. He thinks eight legs is too many legs.
Amanda: Fair.
Brandon: It is too many legs.
Eric: It’s too many legs.
Brandon: I mean this is a little bit existential, but I do think Milo’s scared of, like, like, failing but not in the existential sense. Just, like, he really doesn't like doing something wrong.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Like, he’s scared of doing it wrong.
Eric: For someone who communes with death and named himself after space, I think – oh, yea, I think something very tangible makes a lot of sense.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: I like genuinely can't think of a good fear for Val that is like a tangible thing that one could fear. I think, like, maybe heights. This is – and this comes from, like, my own personal fear. I'm not afraid of heights, but I'm afraid of, like, being at a height where there is no boundary between me and falling off of the thing that I'm at the height of. Like, airplanes rear.
Brandon: That’s a reasonable fear.
Julia: Yes, I understand.
[Amanda, Julia, and Brandon laugh]
Julia: But, like, I'm fine on airplanes. But, if I was, like, standing on the, like, edge of a cliff and looking down, that would scare the shit out of me.
Brandon: Yeah, I just think Milo is afraid of birds.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Fair.
Julia: Maybe he shouldn't have, you know, recreated a bunch of turkeys’ carcasses then.
Eric: Yeah, he did that do himself. That sucks.
Brandon: Do you ever think that's – that’s why he became afraid of birds, Julia?
Julia: Maybe. It's a new fear.
Eric: He did it to himself. Oh, yeah. Dez also doesn't like clowns.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: That's valid.
Amanda: Completely true.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Dez is correct.
Brandon: I was gonna – what if – what if, Eric?
Eric: Hmm.
Julia: What if?
Brandon: Unless --
Eric: What if?
Amanda: What if?
Eric: Marvel presents What If.
Julia: There it is.
[Amanda snickers]
Brandon: What if Dez is a birthday party clown sometimes on the off days?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: No, because he hates it. Also, he's paid very well by Dr. Morrow.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Maybe he wants to – like an immersion therapy attempted and then were just like, “This is not worth it.”
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Eric (as Dez): I fucking hate this. No.
[Brandon, Julia, and Amanda laughs]
Amanda: Maqualla asked on Instagram, “What's everyone's drunk habit?” And it's Aggie’s cleaning. I think Aggies is not cleaning. I think Aggie is, at the end of a party, just sit on the couch, listen to a record, or, like, you know, watch some public access television, and then go to bed.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: And leave the dishes for tomorrow.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Wild.
Eric: That’s fair. Although, I do think you, you did clean during – during the holiday party.
Amanda: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, Aggie – Aggie was sober. She was – had to, like, keep an eye on the whole interaction here.
Eric: Oh, right. Right. Right.
Julia: As we established from the party, Val likes to pick people up over their head.
[Amanda and Eric laughs]
Brandon: Yeah, I think Milo likes – just talks louder than he should, you know.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: I think that we saw your two. Yeah, when Val pick people up and Milo tell secrets when he's drinking.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: He’s a secret teller.
Brandon: Only to – only to Lucas.
Eric: We're in is – we're in your head. So, it's funny. But we already knew these things. So, he's like, “I think Quinn is pretty.” And we're like, “Yeah, we know, Milo.”
[Brandon and Eric laughs]
Julia: You made it real obvious, bro.
Amanda: Nippona Eqi Multiverse on Twitter asks, “If, now, that way of mercy has become an official subclass, if I've considered switching to the official version or from continuing to use way of tranquility, which is Aggie’s current subclass that was in UA, and then I kind of took like a homebrewed version that fixed a little bit of the healing mechanics from a person on Reddit. Yeah, I, I think that way of mercy is interesting. When I made the character, it wasn't official, of course. And it's more of like a plague doctor, which I'm not really interested in being.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: So, I, I'm – I’m good with, with tranquility for now.
Eric: I think that you – that wave of tranquility has the thing – you haven't done it yet, but I think it’s the thing that defines Aggie in my head, which is the ability to get someone to stop being aggro --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- or stop being aggressive and stop fighting. And that's what I feel like is Aggie’s entire deal as a monk, while the plague doctor’s like, “I’ll heal you but also poison.”
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Julia: No, tranquility and mercy seem very opposite in my mind.
Eric: Yeah. For all you nerds out there, I did a dig into it. Tranquillity was from the UA before Xanathar’s back in --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- like, 2016 - 2017. Like, the Way of the Kensei Monk, which is in Xanathar’s, which is giving a monk a weapon, was in that. While Way of – Way of Mercy was something that was introduced in UA in 2020 and then got published in Tasha’s. Yeah. I don't know. I just – I think that it's also something very endemic about what Wizard of the Coast thinks they should be in D&D. It’s like, “Oh, no one wants to be a not fighter. So, we're gonna give them a mask and give them poison damage.” And I'm like, “Some people want to do this, guys.”
Julia: Some people just don't want to fight and that's okay.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: You wouldn't know. They wouldn't – you wouldn't think, but that's true.
Amanda: I very much chose the subclass based on some of the higher level moves that Aggie will get. So, I'm excited to see you guys, like, see Aggie come into her own because I wanted to play a character who sort of kept her powers on the down low and didn't really engage with them a lot. But, for narrative reasons, that's not interesting. So, I feel like Aggie has been just kind of, you know, a support character in a lot of ways. But I think as her – you know, either she decides to use her powers more or has to use her powers more and as I mechanically level up and get better powers, that it'll be, hopefully, interesting to see.
Brandon: Also, don't wear a plague doctor mask, please. That's too spooky.
Amanda: No, no, no.
Julia: Too scary.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Do not – I do not like it.
Amanda: Sister Pampbells on Twitter asks, “My husband thought of a question for El Silvero.” Eric, here. So, Mister, Sister Pampbells asks, “Did you know from the beginning who the “villain” of the story would be or have our heroes choices, how superhero to be, not teaming up with Emily, et cetera, changed what you had in mind?
Eric: Oh, that's a good question. I always wanted Gutenberg to be lurking in the background. It’s something that I had in the back of my head. And, now, that I've, as you've heard, watched all of Teen Titans --
[Everybody laugh]
Eric: -- I really like his – you could have a parallel to Slade in the Teen Titans show. I think that him being in the back lurking, always being around. You don't really know what he's doing until something and then he pops up, which is something we learned until the bear – you thought it was a giant scary bear and then, “Oh, it's made out of pixels. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.” And, like, we didn't know. We haven't talked about him in how long? So, I think that that's something I really liked about Gutenberg. But, to the second half, that means everything else can change. He is the only thing that I planned from the beginning. And then the way that it happened was the way that it happened. I was very clear from the beginning of this that, like, you could join Emily or not., You could be super heroic or knots. You can do this the way that you want because so much was up for grabs. Why I have this backbone. Like, I control the arc structure. Like, here's how long I think this is gonna take. Here's how long I think this is gonna take. Here is, like, this main backbone. But, like, everything else, all the meat, all the guts and the organs and the fun stuff, that's all the players.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Eric Silver, all the guts and the organs and the fun stuff 2020.
Eric: My literal job is Billy's bones – like skeleton stuff. We're working on like a – on a podcaster kit for Multitude, which is gonna come out soon. And, like, I realized my entire job as the head of creative is just, like, pre-production when it’s just, like, structure your show. If you – it's – it's – the structure of a podcast is the bones. And, sometimes – and, most of the times, you don't want to see the bones. But, sometimes, you want to see the bone.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: And, like, that's how I feel about all shows, but especially the DM’s relationship to the players in a D&D game.
Amanda: I’m going to close out before we, we hit Spoily Corner with a question from Megan Corner. Val, would you rather never eat pizza for the rest of your life or never be able to cuddle any dogs? I’m sorry to get so dark here.
Julia: Oh, oh, no. You know what? I think Val would go with the never eat pizza ever again because there's a million dishes in Italian cuisine that you can enjoy. But a dog, you, you had to cuddle the dogs.
Amanda: You could just unfold the Calzone, I suppose.
Julia: Yeah.
[Brandon chuckles]
Brandon: I've been watching a lot of animal shows on Disney Plus. And I've never wanted to cuddle an animal more than I want to cuddle bears. They're the fluffiest little friends ever.
Eric: Bears are the best. I know they're killing machines, but they're amazing and wonderful.
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: Well, what a perfect transition to Spoily Corner, guys. Thank you so much. Laura on Instagram, “Is Eric in a dare to see how many bears he could feature in his D&D campaign?”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: I fucking love bears. Get off my back. They're my favorite animal. They're fucking tight.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Just fucking deal with it.
Amanda: Who can say?
Eric: And we – Upstate New York, what do you want?
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: You're right. I shouldn't have put this in Spoily Corner.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Okay. So, let's – let's get into the true spoilies. Pearl Wisdom, “Dr. M has always seemed nefarious to me, but everyone seems to trust her blindly. Big reveal coming?”
Julia: Who can say?
Brandon: Who can say?
Eric: Who can say?
Amanda: Who can say?
Eric: Eyes Emoji.
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda: Question Surgeon Michelle Spurgeon, “Did Dr. Mayor Morrow know that the Gigabear was another pixel threat like the bombs? Who can say?
Eric: Who can say?
Julia: Who can say?
Brandon: I want to know, too.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Jayangs, “Is Val actually Valentine from Campaign I but in a trench coat?
Brandon: Hah!
Julia: No.
[Brandon and Eric laughs]
Amanda: No, but good question. Mel118, “When is the JTP album dropping? I'm loving these theme song or rewrites.” You can get the new theme song on our merch store.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Please go buy.
Julia: I, I think they're referring to Eric's incredible Christmas songs.
Amanda: Ah.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: Oh, I assumed it was about Brandon. That's why I put him there.
Amanda: That’s so funny.
Eric: Brandon, will you make another band camp for the stuff that you – that – for anything you've compiled? I know that you're writing less for Campaign 2, but is there anything else?
Brandon: Um, I know I can't resell it because just of legal reasons.
Eric: Ooh.
Brandon: But I could probably put it somewhere as like a package.
Eric: That’d be tight.
Brandon: But I will – one, I've had a fun time putting jingle bells --
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon: -- and tuning Eric’s singing on the podcast.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Wow. Wow.
Amanda: Wow.
Julia: His auto tune? Oh, no.
Brandon: And I will cut that out and you can buy it for 40 cents on our merch store.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: Incredible.
Amanda: Maqualla2001, “What is so important about the locket? Why is Mayor Morrow so sad when she can't find it?”
Julia: Who can say?
Amanda: Who can say?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Who can say?
Amanda: And multiple people, to close this out, “Is this all a simulation?”
Brandon: Better not be.
Julia: I really hope not at this point.
Amanda: I mean our campaign is in your imagination. So, in that sense, yes.
Brandon: That's true.
Julia: But they all think we're still stuck in the danger fun zone.
[Amanda laughs]
Amanda: Yeah, I know.
Eric: Yeah, because they saw a – because they saw Clippy/Steven. They think it’s all simulation.
Amanda: I sure should hope not because that means Clippy’s still around.
Julia: Huh!
Eric: Who can say? Who can really say, honestly?
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Well, everybody, thank you so much for bringing us such amazing questions, for engaging with our content, and for supporting us. And we have actually gotten at some of these spoilies in episodes that we have since played. And I can't wait for you to hear them. I know we say this all the time and it sucks to hear. But I'm sorry. Deal with it.
[Everyone laugh]
Amanda: Episodes coming up are the best ones ever. I am so excited and proud of all of you for the work that you've all put into the plot in these episodes and I just like, “Oh, my god, I can't. It’s so good.”
Julia: Oh, hell yeah, doc.
Brandon: Eric, you've been knocking your teammates out of the park.
Eric: [Inaudible 1:0012].
Brandon: There is – there is no park for Eric anymore. He's, he’s beyond the park.
Eric: Thank you.
Amanda: The sign says, “No DMing here.”
Eric: Yeah. Only Eric's. I am – I'm really – I really love a lot of the stuff that we've done in this campaign. But, like, these next episodes, I'm really stoked for all of you. Hey, remember when we built all those relationships that your characters have?
Amanda: Oh, no. Are you saying that having stakes in the world makes it easier and more risky to put those stakes on the line?
Eric: Who can say?
[Everybody laugh]
Amanda: Well, speaking of which, I feel like that was a mean thing to say. Can we – can we tease anything so that the people are not just like, “Arrrr, we have to wait.”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: No, I think that – yeah, the relationships that people are going to do together are going to come together. A lot of stuff is gonna happen. I think that's really something to look forward to. It’s that, like, it's not just like, “Oh, new things.” It's like lots of – lots of stuff for all characters are going to happen. Also, um, hey, keep an eye on your, your feeds for something that might be an empty slot on that week around Christmas.
Brandon: Hmm.
Eric: Maybe December 22nd. Maybe there'll be something, something a little fantastical with a – with a fun special guest that's going to be in there.
Julia: Hmm.
Brandon: Who can say?
Amanda: Who can say?
Eric: Who can say? Well, that, that was such a nice new After Party. Hey, everyone should go buy the Cool Cryptid Compendium, which you can find --
Julia: Hell yeah.
Eric: -- at either the Join the Party or the Spirits merch stores. And we're gonna see you next week for a whole new episode. So, get out of here.
Julia: Wooh!
Amanda: Later.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party.
Eric (to the tune of “O Christmas Tree”): O Gigabear O Gigabear
Why’d you destroy our science?
O Gigabear O Gigabear
You run on 64-bit compliance
The MMFC almost came down
But Vulcani gave you a beatdown
O Gigabear O Gigabear
Those drones came out of nowhere.
O Lucas Friend O Lucas Friend
I wonder where Milo went
O Lucas Friend O Lucas Friend
This sure was a big event
Good thing that Quinn actually helped
And did what her big sister yelped
O Lucas Friend, O Lucas Friend
Wait, is Dr. Morrow OK?
[Upbeat Music]
Eric: I would like six weeks of Christmas carols a lot more if they were based on my Dungeon and Dragons campaign. Let's get the party started.
[JTP Theme Music]
Eric: But, hey, we're at the end of an arc. So, let's do some leveling up, shall we?
Julia: Let's do it.
Brandon: Yay. I'm excited for levels.
Eric: Thank you. That's the enthusiasm I crave, Brandon. Please deliver that to me all the time.
Brandon: I'm excited for levels.
Eric: Great. Thank you. Good. That's very good. So, here's what happened. Val and Milo, you get two levels. And, Aggie, here's a secret surprise for you. You get two levels. And then I think of days after when you're just like – you're thinking about like, “Wow. I can't believe. I thought a giant 8-bit bear.” But then it's like, “Oh, no, wait. I didn't. I didn't run in and sacrifice my body against the giant bear. I used all my information and my smarts. That's what the volcano thing was trying to teach me.”
Brandon (as Milo): I don't get it. What?
Eric: Yeah, I know. That's why this is not happening to you, Milo. So, Aggie, you get an extra here, that half a level, because you interacted with the Gollum box and you used it in part to your actual knowledge of buildings and things. And you let Quinn do her thing, which ultimately turned out to be a good thing. You get that extra half level. So, you get three levels.
Amanda (as Aggie): Wow, level eight.
Brandon (as Milo): Dang.
Eric: This is like DM inspiration, but I want you to surprise me. And I want to give you actual benefits other than advantage one time. So, it's just about character growth, man. It's just about your journey.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, sure. I mean I'm already perfect. So, that’ll never happen for me.
Eric: That's true. Milo has a card that says by Milo Lane, perfect boy.
Brandon: He does. Did he give you one?
Eric: Yeah, he did. He got it – he made it on Vistaprint and gave it to me. And I'm like, “You have great deals. Might as well – I'm sure you have 250 of these.”
Brandon: He accidentally ordered 5,000.
Eric: He was like, “It was the best deal. What am I supposed to do? I got 10 percent off.”
Amanda (as Aggie): Only rubes pay for shipping.
Eric: So, now, Milo and Val are level seven and a half and – which is just level eight.
Amanda (as Aggie): Wooh!
Eric: So, tell me some of the cool stuff y'all get and tell me your HP.
Julia (as Val): So, Val got two new class features. One is a feral instinct, which gives me advantage on initiative. And I can't be surprised --
Brandon: Ooh.
Julia (as Val): -- in combat.
Amanda: Dang.
Julia (as Val): That's cool.
Brandon: Very fancy.
Julia (as Val): And I also got a very cool Battlerager thing called Reckless Abandon. So, when I attack with reckless attack, I gain temporary hit points equal to my constitution modifier.
Brandon: That is nice.
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Eric: That's probably helpful for the tank.
Julia (as Val): Yeah, very useful.
Eric: Very useful. Very useful.
Julia (as Val): It ends when I finished raging, but it is very cool.
Eric: Do you ever finish raging though? Like, aren’t you just always raging?
Julia (as Val): No, I'm always in a rage.
Eric: Like, emotionally?
Brandon: Deep. That’s deep.
Julia (as Val): My soul, always in a rage.
Eric: And then Hitomi is like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Sit down. We're watching a movie.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Julia, what's your HP?
Julia: 69.
Eric: Nice.
Brandon: Nice.
Eric: Good job. Proud of you.
Brandon: Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
Julia: I rolled that, too.
Eric: Good.
Julia: I’m very proud of my dice.
Amanda: I have 59 hit points. Still nice.
Julia: Hmm.
Eric: Nice in a different way.
Amanda: My favorite part of leveling up is that I get more key points. And, now, I have eight to burn. And I get a couple cool monk things. So, I've key empowered strikes. Meaning that my punches are magic now. So, my arm strikes count as magical for the purpose of, like, overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage. So, even if a creature is immune to non-magical attacks, I can still attack them.
Julia: Nice.
Brandon: That's great.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: I also have evasion in combat, stillness of mind, which means as an action, I can end an effect on myself. That makes me either charmed or frightened.
Julia: Whoa.
Amanda: I'm very excited about that one. But, best of all, this is the reason I chose this subclass for Aggie. It's called emissary of peace. So, I can basically defuse violent situations. And the way the mechanic works is, whenever I make a charisma check to either calm violent emotions or council peace, I get advantage. I have to do it in good faith. It can't be, like, either deception or intimidation. And I also gain proficiency in the performance or persuasion skill.
Eric: Hot dang.
Julia: Just checking in with Aggie, how’s your charisma?
Amanda (as Aggie): My charisma, Julia, is now one.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Julia: Hah. Yay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yay.
Julia: No negatives anymore.
Brandon: Are you gonna become a politician? Do you think?
Amanda (as Aggie): I think not, but I think I will take my proficiency here in performance because I'm already pretty good at persuasion.
Julia: Alright.
Eric: Hey, Milo, I hear you're just a druid. So, I assume that this is just gonna be like --
Julia: Normal Druid shit.
Eric: -- some plant. So, you’re like, “Oh, look at this plant. Nice.”
Brandon (as Milo): Actually, kinda. Yeah. It's all just normal Druid stuff. Mostly, I got some more hit points. I'm up to 44. I got a level four spell slot. So, now, I have two of my special spells, which are blight and confusion --
Julia: Whoa.
Brandon (as Milo): -- as well as other fourth level spells. And, most importantly, my big change is my feature called Connect with the Dead, which, basically, I get to cast – speak with the dead for free. And, when I do that, I get to roll on the revived capabilities table and there's different effects. Like, I get to learn language of my choice, or learn a proficiency, or gain proficiency on a saving throw, or cast one spell at my highest spell slot for free.
Amanda: Wow.
Brandon (as Milo): And, so, various things like that.
Julia: That's pretty cool.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I get to be like Haley Joel Osment and, and see dead people. It's great.
Julia: Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm.
Eric: Wonderful. Okay. So, Vulcani and the Preserver talked to Channel Seven and a Half News, cleared everything up. The museum is safe. Canonical person in Lake Town City, Jake, Julia's husband, he is getting the construction of MMFC down. And it's getting repaired after nearly falling over. The snow plows came through. People can drive once again after the Great Blizzard of 20XX.
Julia: I need to let you know that I told him that after that session and he's like, “Yeah, that's what I would do.”
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: So, yeah, before we go into Christmas time and what happens there at the end of December, do you – any of you three want to tie up any particular loose ends?
Amanda: No, I think Aggie’s only things that she wants to accomplish are buying a couple of last minute gifts and figuring out what she's doing for Christmas.
Eric: Wonderful. That sounds good. Val, Milo, do you have anything you want to pull on?
Brandon: Not really. I think Milo – the only thing Milo would have is, like, the opposite of pulling on a thread of, like, Milo’s just avoiding having to talk to Lucas. I don't think he's seen much of Lucas in the intervening days. And he's purposely avoiding his texts and calls.
Eric: Yes, that's a great question. Why don't you make a charisma check for me?
Brandon: Okay. Nine minus 148.
Eric: Okay. So, you are intentionally avoiding Lucas for sure. You're not, like, responding anything. You notice Apple has been sending a lot of links in the group text between the four of you.
Brandon: Is he just, like, dropping like, “Oh, man, I wonder if I'm gonna get this for the holiday season? Oooh.
Eric: No, it's – it’s – I mean not even, like – it's not even, like, presents, which you would assume that something Apple would do. Or, like, hack into your computer and put it in your downloads.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So, you’d be like, “What's this?” You’re like, “Oh.” Like, trying to incept you in your computer. No Apples like posting links to funny and stupid videos and posting those, like, terrible click baity articles that are nothing.
Brandon: Hmm.
Eric: And he's, like, really trying to blow up the group chat a lot.
Amanda: A lot of average bear stuff.
Eric: Yeah, lots of average bear stuff.
Brandon: Interesting. Well, I think Milo has put the group chat on Do Not Disturb for now.
Julia: Ahhh.
Brandon: Because he's trying to avoid the problem because it's Milo and he's bad at solving problems.
[Julia chuckles]
Eric: Nice. Hey, everybody, if this is your first episode, great characterization of Milo.
[Julia and Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yeah, that was up.
Julia: I don't know. I think Val is kind of keeping an eye out for family drama right now.
Eric: Sure. Sure. Sure.
Julia: But also spending a lot of time kind of, like, in between hanging out with Hitomi and spending time with their mom.
Eric: Wonderful. Why don't you make a charisma check as well for me?
Julia: Cool. Just straight charisma?
Eric: Straight up.
Julia: Nineteen plus two.
Eric: Wonderful, 21.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: On December 23rd, you get a knock at the door. Can you remind me again how Val gets presents from their dad?
Julia: Just an Amazon wish list I feel like.
Eric: That's right. It was Amazon wish list. Did you add anything particular like a – like a Christmas item as if this was Toys R Us and it had to be the biggest thing on the page?
[Brandon chuckles]
Julia: Oh, I’m not sure. I feel like they put on maybe some – again, Hitomi’s been showing them a lot of anime lately. So, I feel like there's, like, a box set of something that they wanted to get to impress her. But --
Eric: Oh, yeah.
Julia: -- maybe that and, also, like, a pallet of, like, really good organic San Marzano tomatoes.
Eric: Ooh.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: From Italy.
Amanda: Wow.
Eric: Oh, that's a bad choice.
Amanda: Can that fit through a door? I guess you could take the crates off.
Julia: Yeah, I mean like – I'm, I’m talking about, like, the supermarket sized one.
Amanda: Okay. I thought you're saying like a shipping pallet. And I was like --
Julia: No.
Amanda: “Holy shit. Are you gonna take over the kitchen in the Slice Shop?”
Eric: Please be clear with Amanda what type of shipping container you think is coming.
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: It’s probably like a 24 can sized one.
Eric: So, yeah, you get a knock on the door. He says --
[Audio play]
Eric (as the UPS Guy): Hey, yeah. So, I got a package for Val V. Vesuvio.
Julia (as Val): Okay. That's – why with my middle? Okay. I open the door.
Eric: There's a UPS guy standing there who gives you a package. He’d be like, “Alright. Hold on. Get out of the way.” And two ups guys are coming in, wheeling in on one of those, like, wheelie carts.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- a five foot tall figurine of All Might from My Hero Academia.
Julia: Incredible. Very, very cool.
Eric: So, uh – so, you're into anime?
Julia (as Val): Please don't talk to me.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Alright. Okay. Sign here.
Julia (as Val): Sign.
Eric: Oh, yeah. So, inside is this Japanese-only, like, Special Edition All – My Hero Academia with, like, the subs and the dubs. I don't even know where this DVD comes from because it doesn't exist in the year of our Lord, the real world, 2020.
Brandon: Subs, the dubs, the abs, the mobs, it’s all there.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: All the – all the abs, they're all there.
Amanda: Can I – can I just propose subs and dubs as a laundromat/comic book store?
Eric: Great.
Brandon: 100 percent. It's very good.
Eric: Yeah. And you're setting it up.
Julia: This is the coolest shit.
Eric: And stuffed into All Might’s hand is a Christmas card.
Julia (as Val): Okay. I pull it out and I open it.
Eric: Yeah, it's a photo of your dad with his third wife, Janine --
Brandon: Oh.
Eric: -- and his three triplets, which he had with Janine. And they're all like five.
Julia: [Inaudible 12:30].
Amanda: Okay, guys. I'm going to write down what I think Eric is going to name these triplets.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: And then I’m going to ask him. And then I will show you.
Eric: Do you think I named them Huey, Dewey, and Louie?
Julia: No.
Brandon: Yep.
Eric: Amanda wrote it out and she has Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
Julia: Okay.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Great. I wrote Vito, Vinny, and Angelo.
Amanda: Haa, that's very good, too.
Brandon: Okay. I just wrote Suds, Duds, and Buds. So --
Julia: Huh!
[Brandon chuckles]
Eric: Brandon, that's – that's – that is the laundromat, anime store, and weed dispensary.
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Julia: That’s very good.
Amanda: Julia, can I, yes, and… Angela into, like --
Julia: Viola.
Amanda: There you go.
Eric: Oh, very nice.
Julia: Vito, Vinny, and Viola.
Eric: Vito, Vinny, and Viola.
Amanda: Oh, my god.
Eric: 100 percent. And, on the back of the card says, “From our family to you.”
Julia: Ouch!
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: I’m gonna need --
Amanda: That’s fun. Some Neosporin for that burn.
Julia: I love it. Go ahead.
Eric: Remember where – who is your family and what that means, family. And family underlined on one side at the end.
Julia: Like, every member of my family does when they send cards, underlining random words.
Eric: Yeah, underline family. And then it says, “From Marco, Janine, and Triple V.”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So, that was, like, written in Janine’s, like, really calligraphy ass handwriting.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And, at the bottom, in your dad's scrawling indecipherable doctor ass handwriting --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- it says PS, tell Minerva I say hello.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: And he underlines hello.
Amanda: Yikes.
Julia (as Val): Oh, I love my dad.
Eric: Wonderful. Okay. So, here's a funny thing that happened a few sessions ago.
Julia: Uh-oh.
Eric: I asked the three of you, “Hey, if there's something you're – you, three, want to do or you want to explore just let me know.” And then you, three, came back with, “We really want to throw a party.”
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Amanda: Yes. Yes, we did.
Julia: It was like, “How can we make Eric talk to himself for 90 percent of the episode?”
Amanda: Yeah.
[Eric chuckles]
Eric: Yeah. Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah, that was the real reasoning. Amanda was like, “Hmm, I have a devious plan.”
Amanda: It was directly after the Milo friend hang out in the bowling alley. And I was like, “Oh, wait. What if all of these NPCs and my family and Dr. Morrow and January are all in --
Brandon: Kiss.
Amanda: -- Aggie’s bungalow for a holiday party?
Julia: Also, kiss.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: No.
Eric: And everyone kisses. So, yeah, let's start it. So, I think, what you talked about was that this was asked Christmas.
Amanda: Yeah, I think, once everybody gets past all the December holidays, it's nice to sort of have an activity in that week between Christmas and New Year that lots of people take off work and school and whatever.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: So, I think it's probably a tradition of Aggie just to, like, have the stragglers who are still at home in Lake Town City come over just to her bungalow and, like, do a potluck. You know, bring whatever booze you want and hang out, including standing around on the back patio, like, deep frying a turkey or something.
Julia: Hell yeah.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: So, I, I think Quinn is a definite yes. I'll probably text, you know, these guys; Dr. Morrow and January and Dez in our group thread with the three of them and just sort of say like, you know, if, if someone's around who needs a place to hang out, you know, bring them.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: Wonderful. I like this. I feel like we're starting an improv scene.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: So, this is – so, I think that, yeah, you text the other group thread and January is like --
Eric (as January): Yeah, I don’t have much to do. Yeah, I’ll come over. That’s fine. Dez, can you come pick me up?
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, I was just in the area.
Brandon: Hold on one second. Are --
Julia: We're gonna have to explain talking rabbit to all of these people.
Brandon: I was gonna say are normal people okay with the talking rabbit?
Eric: Yeah, man. Not my place. It’s not my party.
Amanda (as Aggie): Exclude January.
Eric: It’s not my party.
Julia: Fine. Listen, everyone's gonna have to get used to talking rabbit. I don't care.
Amanda: (Sigh) Ahhh, that's true.
Eric (as January): Everyone loves someone. It looks like I’m drinking a beer and then I do KC at the back. Everyone loves it.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Very cute.
Brandon: I guess, when you have Dr. Morrow as a Mayor, like nothing's weird anymore, you know.
Julia: Yeah. No, it's fine. I love it. I love that we're gonna have to explain a talking rabbit to a lot of people. That's fun for me.
Eric: Yeah, you also text Quinn and Quinn’s like --
Eric (as Quinn): Hey, yeah, can I bring – I have a friend in area who is just like really – you know, who is this cool guy. I’ll bring her – I’ll bring her up.
Amanda (as Aggie): January is coming, but, as long as you trust her/she will think that it is a prank somehow/she's cool staying outside? Then that works.
Eric (as Quinn): Aggie, you’re the best. I love January.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay. Maybe I'm, again, treating this with way more seriousness than everybody else.
Eric (as Quinn): Is January a secret? Is January – like, should people not know about January?
Amanda (as Aggie): I don’t know. I don't know.
Eric (as Quinn): Oh, yeah. No, because you had, had January before, which is the same thing as like, “Oh, I didn't know about Tom Waits. And I met Tom Waits. I listen to his music.” And then is like, “Oh, hell yeah.”
Brandon: Eric, Tom Waits is a secret.
Julia: Secret Tom Waits.
Amanda: I think I'll check in with January and say, you know, is it okay if we have some friends or friends at the party in Re: Your security clearance.
Eric (as January): Oh, yeah, man. I would really love it when I’m drinking a beer and doing [Inaudible 17:38].
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): January, you're wonderful and a dear friend. And then I --
Eric (as January): Well, thank you.
Amanda (as Aggie): I tell Quinn yes.
Eric: Hell yeah. Milo, you get a text from the group chat. And Apple’s like --
Eric (as Apple): Hey, what are you, guys, doing? I’m gonna celebrate --
Brandon (as Milo): Apple, why are you yelling on text?
Eric (as Apple): So, I can get my point across.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Apple): Hey, I’m not doing anything. I don’t do any because, you know, shows people are Jewish. So, hey, just doing everything right. Zak’s already over. So, we're just hanging out. But, like, what are you doing?
Brandon (as Milo): I'm going to this, this shindig at, at Aggie’s place, you know, for the --
Eric (as Apple): Oh, cool.
Brandon (as Milo): -- for the locals. Do you want to come?
Eric (as Apple): Oh, fuck yeah, dude. Let’s all go.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Eric: And then Zak replies with a GIF with – which is just a thumbs up.
Brandon (as Milo): Can y'all both bring something to this party and not just like show up and crash? Like, like, I'm not saying that that's what you'd normally do. But, like, that is what you don't really do, you know.
Eric: Lucas responds.
Eric (as Lucas): That is what we normally do.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah. Can you, like, bring a food or, like, a drink or something?
Eric: Apple says --
Eric (as Apple): Yeah, I got some chips that I haven’t eaten from, like, Y2K. Is that fine?
Brandon (as Milo): Is it – are they open already?
Eric (as Apple): I have to check.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay. Let me clarify. Bring something that's unopened, please.
Eric: Zak responds with the same thumbs up GIF.
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Amanda: When in doubt, order pizza to the party.
Eric: Yeah. Wonderful. Alright. Cool. Cool.
Julia: Val's gonna invite Hitomi and their mom.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: Ooh.
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'll also tell the O'Hare family group chat and just, like, if Quinn comes over a little early to help set up or whatever, just, like, text them a selfie of the two of us.
Eric: Cool. Love it. Yeah, the group text has a lot of apologies. They’re like --
Eric (as Danny): Oh, I’d love to go, but I’m doing --
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Danny): -- this really strange famous thing.
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: Still in Berlin. Love you.
Eric: Yeah. Yeah, that’s what Danny says in Berlin. You knew that.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Ryan takes a photo of him and Travis Pastrana and Shawn White.
Julia: Hmm. Sure.
Eric: It seems like they're in the air, which is concerning.
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: Incredible.
Amanda: And I think Reagan Texas, like, a selfie she took while on stage in, like, Tokyo or some shit.
Eric: Reagan's, like, busy.
[Julia and Brandon laughs]
Eric: But also says to Quinn --
Eric (as Reagan): Oh, Quinn tell [Inaudible 20:04] I said hi.
Julia: Hmm.
Eric: And Quinn says --
Eric (as Quinn): Got it.
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: But, yeah, everyone – now, everyone comes through. So, Aggie you're getting ready and you're gonna set up the party.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, I think I’ll just kind of push the furniture, you know, a little bit to the sides of the room, make sure the patio is, is clear of any snow drifts, and pick up a bunch of, you know, chips and drinks and stuff at the local Stuart’s.
Eric: Wonderful. I like it. Will you make a perception check for me?
Amanda (as Aggie): Gladly.
[Throws dice]
Amanda (as Aggie): 18.
Eric: Okay, with an 18. So, you're at the Stuart’s and you're picking up beer and chips and stuff. And you go to the, the cashier and the cashier says --
Eric (as the cashier): Do you need any, any other help today?
Amanda (as Aggie): No, I found everything just fine. Thanks.
Eric: Alright. And you look up.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, god.
Eric: This guy looks exactly like Clippy.
Julia: I was gonna ask.
Eric: The bulbous nose, those shaggy 70s hair, the – he's wearing a crop top even though it's very cold out.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Aggie goes very pale and says --
Amanda (as Aggie): Clippy?
Eric (as Steven): Excuse me?
Amanda (as Aggie): Hi, I'm a regular here. What's your name?
Eric (as Steven): Ah, yeah. Steven?
Amanda (as Aggie): Are you guessing?
Eric (as Steven): No, you just started leading by referring to me as a discontinued 90s Microsoft vehicle.
Amanda (as Aggie): I, I got confused. I was trying to say Cammy. That's what I call Camel cigarettes. Don't smoke. Here you go. I put $60 on the – on the counter and run by.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Steven): Wait. So, you don't want Camel cigarettes?
Amanda (as Aggie): No, thank you.
Eric (as Steven): Alright. Have a good day. If there's anything else I can help you with?
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): No, I throw my stuff in the car.
[Amanda laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): I text our three group chat with the, “SOS. No, not really sorry. I think Clippy is a cashier at Stuart's??”
Julia (as Val): What? Also, I’m at your house.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'll be right back.
Eric: I like this that Val was there early and, now, you're like setting up.
Julia: Yeah, Val showed up early with Hitomi because Hitomi insisted on getting there early.
Eric: I, I love that.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And Hitomi’s like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Oh, my god. I love your plates. It's so nice. Oh, are those real? Are those real Red Wings? Like, I can't even find any that fit my – that fit my foot, but I have tiny bird feet because I'm a tiny bird.
Julia: She has tiny bird bones. It's very cute.
Eric: So, while you're out of the Stuart’s, you text Val. And, Val, you and Hitomi are – I guess are just putting stuff together.
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Eric: Maybe you might be throwing together a quick pizza. I, I don't --
[Amanda chuckles]
Eric: I'm only trying to assume what Val would do.
Julia (as Val): Pizza and setting up the bar. It's very important.
Eric: Wonderful.
Julia (as Val): Hitomi and I brought stuff for Boilermakers.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, I feel like I definitely come home and I had just a few, like, dusty liquor bottles, like, in a high cabinet in the kitchen. And, now, suddenly, I have, like, a gleaming bar setup.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Hitomi’s like --
Eric (as Hitomi): I don't even know what to put Chamboard in.
Julia: Whatever you want. That's the – the best part about Chamboard is just the taste go with everything.
Eric: Oh, babe. I love it. That's great. Thank you. Well, I love that. And, while you're setting that together, you hear a ding dong. And Quinn’s like --
Eric (as Quinn): Hey, Aggie, let me in. Aggie!
Julia (as Val): I go and answer the door.
Eric: You answer the door.
Julia (as Val): I am not Aggie.
Eric: And Quinn’s like --
Eric (as Quinn): Oh, you're not Aggie. Okay. That's fine.
Eric: And behind Quinn is Taylor Swift.
Brandon: What?
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: Hey.
Julia: HeyHey Just silence out of Val staring at Taylor Swift like --
Julia (as Val): Ah, uh, do you want a Boilermaker? What?
[Amanda and Brandon laugh]
Julia (as Val): We got Chamboard.
Eric (as Taylor): Yeah. No, I'd love – that would be so great. Thank you so much. I was just in the area. Quinn said there's gonna be a party. So, let's make it a party. Chamboard all around.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): This is my girlfriend, Hitomi. I don't – okay.
Eric: Hitomi is just unfazed. She's like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Oh, hell yeah, another girl who's my height. Fuck it.
[Everybody laughs]
Julia (as Val): You guys are gonna be best friends. And that's gonna be very good for me as a person.
Eric: Hitomi is just like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Hey, Taylor, so, if I – we become best friends, is this like a, a black card situation where I get a special card to like do stuff?
Eric: And Taylor is like --
Eric (as Taylor): Yes, it's exactly like that.
Julia (as Val): I'm gonna go make Boilermakers for everyone because I can't handle the situation.
Eric: And Quinn jumps up on the counter and is like --
Eric (as Quinn): Was this a – should I not – should I have not done – is this --
Julia (as Val): No, this is --
Eric (as Quinn): I mean Taylor doesn’t have anything to do.
Julia (as Val): Thank you for this gift for the holidays.
[Amanda chuckles]
Julia (as Val): I really appreciate it. Can I get you something to drink?
Eric (as Quinn): No, I'll just use my sticky hands and grab them.
Eric: And she just grabs a beer.
Brandon: No doubt.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric: And she just like has it in her hand.
Julia (as Val): Very good. But, also, don't use the superpowers in front of Taylor Swift or anyone else at this party.
Eric: Okay. Whatever.
Julia (as Val): Great.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think Sushi jumps down from the top of a bookshelf and just, like, sits in Taylor's lap for the whole party.
Eric: Yeah, 100 percent.
Julia: Incredible.
Eric: Yeah. Aggie, at point, now, you're coming home. So, now, Hey, Taylor Swift's in your apartment.
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn has done worse things to me.
[Everybody laugh]
Amanda (as Aggie): So, I – to me and I'm like, “Oh” --
Eric: Likely – like what?
Amanda (as Aggie): Like, asked me to pick her up at a party and there's 14 kids and it's below zero. So, I had to put them in my truck bed even though that is highly unsafe and, also, accidentally, flooded our childhood home because she was trying to see how long she could use Ryan's foot to stop up a drain.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: I love that. Also, maybe one time she tried to get you to pick her up from a party and you're like, “Okay. Where?” And she, like, drops a pin. And it's the Metropolitan Museum of Art because she's at the Met Gala.
Amanda: I think she's probably also FaceTime me in famous company to be like, “How do you open a wine bottle with a key?”
Eric: And is like --
Eric (as Quinn): Jeff Goldblum and I --
[Eric and Julia laugh]
Julia: Just a poor skill to have.
Eric (as Quinn): Me and Lil Uzi Vert couldn't figure it out.
[Brandon chuckles]
Julia: Yeah, exactly.
Eric: Incredible. Yeah. So, yeah, Taylor Swift’s now in your – in your bungalow.
Amanda (as Aggie): I walk in. And, honestly, the Clippy thing rattled me more. So, I'm just gonna walk in, put the stuff down, and be like, “Oh, sick the bar looks great. Yo, what's up, Hitomi? Oh, hey, I'm – I’m Aggie. I'm Quinn’s sister.”
Eric: And she's like --
Eric (as Taylor): I'm Taylor Swift.
Amanda (as Aggie): Great to meet you. I see that Sushi likes you and that is a great kind of mark of character in my book.
Eric (as Taylor): Sushi?
Amanda (as Aggie): That is – that is his name.
Eric (as Taylor): Aaaah!
Eric: And then she takes a photo of her and Sushi. And, the next day, it is the most liked photo on Instagram.
Julia: Incredible.
Brandon: Taylor Swift introduced herself as Taylor Swift.
Julia: Yes.
Brandon: Two names.
Eric: It's either that or Taytay. You're just gonna have to choose one of the two.
[Brandon chuckles]
Eric: Alright. Wonderful. Hey, Milo, when do you – when do you show up?
Brandon (as Milo): I assume Aggie probably set a start time that's like, you know, actually 30 to 45 minutes to an hour about when she doesn't want people to show up. Like, before she wants people to actually show up.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think it’s, like, 6:45 right now and I said any time after 7:00.
Brandon: Yeah. So, I think Milo would show up probably, like, 7:15 or so.
Eric: Cool. Are you waiting for your other bros to show up before you go in?
Brandon (as Milo): No, I don't think so.
Eric: Cool.
Brandon (as Milo): I mean they're – they're adults.
Eric: I don't know, man. I don’t --
Julia: He dropped the address. He knows what's up.
Eric: Apple really tried to make you all roll as a crew for a while. It's just never got on. He's like –
Eric (as Apple): We need to go into places together all the time.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: But, yeah, that's fine. So, yeah, Milo, you come in and inside is Quinn and Taylor Swift and the rest of the assembly of people.
Julia (as Val): How’s Milo doing?
Brandon: Milo walks in. He's got, like, his hands full. He's got like a – one of those, like, big boxes, like, 18 packs of, like, assorted sours, like, in cans.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Jenny – because of the advent of a new – of a new city with a new hipster area, Genesee now makes a sour pack.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Very good.
Brandon: And, like, he's got like a – you know, like, a casserole dish full of, like, sweet potato casserole with, like, this really delicious marshmallow cookie filling or topping thing.
Amanda: Hell yeah.
Julia: Love it.
Eric: Ooh.
Brandon: And, so, he's, like, walking. He’s like --
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, Aggie, I brought some stuff.
Brandon: And then he doesn't speak the rest of the party.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Julia: So, I was just gonna ply him with alcohol until they can get him talking.
Eric: I like the idea you're holding it and then Hitomi, like, picks one of the serving spoon from the bain-marie and just lay open – opens the casserole up and take a scoop and be like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Oh, yeah, that’s good stuff. Hi, I’m Hitomi.
Julia (as Val): Isn't she so cool?
Brandon: Milo just, like, nods.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric (as Hitomi): Babe, babe, this is great. We got to get one of this.
Julia: That's Milo. He can't talk right now just like I couldn't talk before.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Hitomi): Oh, hell, yeah. Man, you're never gonna get Taylor's black card like that.
Eric: And she takes the casserole and gives them to Taylor.
Brandon: I also like to think that Milo, in order to deflect people's interest away from him, whenever he's uncomfortable, he just, like, summons Tuna and, like, Tuna, like, either is on his shoulder or his head the entire time.
Eric: I love that. Taylor Swift also then keeps asking you, like, really specific cat care questions.
Brandon (as Milo): And I just nod or shake my head yes or no.
Eric: Yeah.
[Eric, Julia, and Amanda laugh]
Eric: I love it.
Midroll Music
Amanda: Hey, it's Amanda. Every year, I sort of rediscover, yes, how annoying it is for it to be very dark during the fall and winter.

Theme Music
Eric: I think, at this point, like, the party is now kicked off now that everybody's ready. Val's mom comes through and she brings boob mugs for everybody.
Julia (as Val): Oh, hell yeah.
Eric: Hitomi and Taylor love it so much. It's so funny.
Julia (as Val): I think this might be the first time my mom is meeting Hitomi. I’m not sure.
Eric: Yeah, I think so. I think too.
Julia (as Val): Sure. Yeah. Smart.
Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Amanda: Good buffer. Good buffer.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia (as Val): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So, it's a lot of your mom telling Hitomi really embarrassing stories of you.
Julia (as Val): Oh.
Eric: I remember this one time.
Julia (as Val): No. Shut up, mom.
Eric: It's a lot of – a lot of that. Yeah. And then Dez and January come through, but the, the sting of the assumed January is really subsumed by Taylor Swift.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: So, everyone is just like, “Oh, hell yeah. Look, oh, she had that rabbit who knew Casey in the bag. Oh, my god.”
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: And then he just, like, moved on. You know, January made everybody scarves.
Julia: Incredible.
Eric: And Dez has, like, like, a jug that has XXX on it. And he's like --
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, sometimes, I just make moonshine and I think this is a pretty good one. It’s like pineapple surprise.
Brandon: Milo has immediately made a beeline for Dez with his boob mug and is like --
Brandon (as Milo): Fill me up now.
Julia: Okay. Val would like to be doing shots of moonshine with Dez, Hitomi, Milo, that whole group.
Brandon: It's less a shot and more eight ounces for Milo, but sure.
Julia: That’s fine. Whatever gets you talking.
Eric: Milo, do you want to make a slide of hand check for if you pretend to take shots while people are taking shots?
Brandon (as Milo): Yes.
Brandon: He doesn't like to do shots, but he does like to drink frequently and in large amounts. Julia: Mhmm. Nice.
Eric: [Inaudible 34:59], don't we all?
Brandon: 11?
Eric: Good. Yeah. You, you try to drink your eight ounces of moonshine while people are taking shots and, like, you take one big gulp because you tipped it to hard.
Brandon: He tipped it too hard. And he’s just like have a coffee and sit and Tuna, like, pats Milo on the back.
Amanda: Aggie also texts Val and Milo.
Amanda (as Aggie): Just give me the high sign if you want me to sober you up a little bit. It's like it's the – you know, the healing stuff.
Julia (as Val): I’m good.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, that's brilliant. I didn’t even think about that.
Julia (as Val): Well, you can heal my hangover tomorrow. How about that?
Eric: Sober hands, yo.
[Julia and Milo laughs]
Eric: I think at, like, 9:00, Lucas comes in. Like, he comes in and, like, says hi to Aggie and says hi to everyone and comes over to Milo. He’s like --
Eric (as Lucas): Did you see Apple and Zak come?
Brandon: Milo shakes his head no.
Eric (as Lucas): Ooh.
Eric: And then you both get a text from Apple and Zak Rose being like --
Eric (as Apple): Oh, we started watching Battlestar again. Ooh.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: It’s a setup.
Brandon: They're making out, aren't they?
Eric: Milo, make a charisma check with disadvantage.
[Dice thrown]
Brandon (as Milo): Six.
Eric: God.
Amanda: Oh, god.
Eric: Apple and Zack Rose spend a lot of time together.
Brandon: Huh!
Julia: That’s weird.
Brandon: Weird.
Eric: Hmm.
Amanda: Really good friends. Just good pals.
Eric: Yeah. And then Lucas says --
Eric (as Apple): Apple and Zak Rose spend a lot of time together.
Brandon: And Milo just shakes his head yes.
Eric: Yeah. Lucas is like --
Eric (as Lucas): Alright. Well, I guess I'll – I'll go get myself a drink. Does that – I don't know what I'm most surprised by, Taylor Swift, the rabbit, or the moonshine.
Julia: All, all of the above.
Eric: Alright. Well, I can't drink Taylor Swift.
Julia: Can you drink rabbit? That’s concerning.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: That, that was a less funny thing to say, but here we are. Here we go.
[Julia and Brandon laugh].
Eric: I think that Lucas goes straight for the moonshine.
Amanda: I feel like he and Dez have some interesting comment. So, they can probably hit it off.
Eric: Yeah, I think so, too. I think they're both into, like, that Nordic sport where you carry your wife --
Julia: Yes.
Eric: -- through an obstacle course.
Brandon: Eric, what?
[Eric chuckles]
Julia: That is a thing.
Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look it up. I’m DMing. I can't look for stuff right now.
Julia: I got it.
Eric (as Dez): So, the real key I think is if you do a fireman carry as opposed to, like, you're carrying bread. That really helps you on the – on the water sections.
Eric: Yeah, you have to be a fucking noob to not do the fireman carry. Everybody knows that.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, fucking, fucking noob.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Brandon: Milo downs another mug full of moonshine.
Eric: Yeah, right. Alright. Yeah. What do you all do? Anything, anything? You're just partying on?
Julia: By the time Lucas showed up, I feel like Val is drunk enough that they are acting like they know him.
[Amanda and Eric laugh]
Eric: Yeah, I love that. It's very funny.
Amanda: I think Aggie will mostly, you know, keep the, the chip bowls full. Like, orders pizza at some point, puts the – a couple of, like, casseroles and dishes and stuff, you know, on the stove.
Amanda (as Aggie): And I'm probably the most regular around Taylor except for Quinn. So, I think I'll chat with them a little bit too and ask Taylor for embarrassing Quinn stories.
Eric: Yeah, Taylor – Taylor's like --
Eric (as Taylor): Oh, man, you're not gonna believe this. So, we were in – we were hanging out with Bonnie Fair. Right. And Bonnie Fair was like, “Oh, my god, we should make a bonfire.” And, and then Quinn was like, “Oh, yeah, I've been doing that for my whole life.” And I was like, “Oh, my god, no way.” So, then Kylie – Kylie and I were like, “Oh, my god, that’s so crazy.” And then Quinn did it. And then she nearly burned down the forest. It was very funny.”
Amanda (as Aggie): I can't believe you didn't FaceTime me on how to start fires.
Eric (as Quinn): I got it. I get it, though.
Julia: Too much.
Eric: No, Bonnie Fair was fine. And Bonnie Fair had to move his mobile home at his other mobile home. Just away.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: But it was like it was fine, honestly. Well, his mobile home and then the mobile home – the mobile home he – where he keeps all of his synthesizers.
Julia: Ah, of course.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: It's a full, like, camper van for his synthesizers.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): I think, also, if Dez has a free moment, I want to show him my tool shed because I'm really proud of my pegboard and, like, all the organization I have with my little station.
Eric: I love that. Yeah, you, you can go out there. And Dez is like --
Eric (as Dez): Hmm. I like how there's a subtle – there's a subtle alphabetic organization, but you wouldn't really know that unless you were – it's actually alphabetically organized by type of tool.
Julia: Exactly.
[Julia chuckles]
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you.
Eric (as Dez): And it’s like you had – it's like this is first one he’s cutting. And then --
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Because, when you think, “Oh, I need to do something. I need to turn. I need to cut. I need to pry.”
Eric: Hey.
Amanda (as Aggie): Like, you know – you know what I'm talking about? I knew you’d get it, Dez.
Eric (as Dez): No, it’s good stuff. I love that. That’s so good. If you want any moonshine, I still have – I have another jug in my – in my – I have another jug in my motorcycle.
Amanda (as Aggie): I’ll – I'll let you know. Thank you.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, Lucas drinks so much of it. I have to go it from my bike.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Yeah, I think, for every two full cups of moonshine that Milo drinks, I will subtly heal him slightly so that he is drunk as opposed to blackout.
Brandon: And Milo is so confused why this is happening. Why he can’t get more drunk?
Eric (as Dez): Here's the thing. I've also been switching it just with pineapple juice just to see if he would notice. He does not.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, Dez, you're such a friend.
Eric (as Dez): It was – it was more of a fun joke for me. Happy, happy Christmas.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Eric (as Dez): Happy Christmas to me even though I don't believe it. I just find that it's more of a fun thing to say around people.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: It’s a seasonal joke. You don't get to say that, you know, all year round.
Eric (as Dez): It's true.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric (as Dez): Happy holidays. Like, are you talking about Arbor Day? You just like --
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: It’s valid. Milo just does that thing, you know, when you're at a party and you're really uncomfortable, so, you just go and sit down next to someone and, like, don't say anything. You just, like, sit slightly too close to them so they know something's up, but you, like, look straight ahead.
Julia: Who does he sit down next to?
Brandon: January. He just goes and sits down next to January.
Julia: Excellent.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Cool.
Julia: Very good.
Eric (as January): Hey, man. Hey man, what's up?
Eric: Also, January is holding a bottle of beer in a paw. Just so you know.
Julia: Incredible.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: He’s drinking – January's drinking Miller High Life. It's so good.
Brandon: Ahh.
Julia: Incredible.
Brandon: Miller High is delicious.
Amanda: Glass bottle or can?
Eric: Oh, glass bottle. Yeah.
Amanda: Nice.
Brandon: Oh, yeah. Milo says nothing. He just nods, but I'm sure Tuna has a – something to say to January.
[Eric laughs]
Eric (as January): Hmm. Milo's doing that thing where he avoids emotional – emotional talks because he has feelings and he doesn’t want people to know about it. Hmm. Hey, did you see that was Taylor Swift?
Brandon: Milo nods.
[Brandon laugh]
Eric (as January): Yeah, man. Okay. Okay. I mean what's up? What's the – what's the emotional thing?
Eric: And Tuna is like --
Eric (as Tuna): He's a bad friend.
[Brandon, Amanda, and Julia laugh]
Eric (as January): Oh, is that – that's a real – is that – I'm sorry that your ghost cat is sitting – I’m sorry your ghost cat just said that. That was really – that was rude.
Brandon: Milo nods.
Eric (as January): So, let's see what's up. What's going on?
[Music playing]
Eric (as January): Alright. Well, here’s the thing, Milo.
Eric: Brandon just nodded on this audio program.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as January): Hey, man. So, you know, if you are being a bad friend, whatever you're doing, I'm sure that your friend just kind of wants you to know what – what's up. And you should just talk to him about what's – what's happening. I'm sure whatever it is, it's not complicated and something you just resolve in a conversation. You know, as a rabbit --
[Julia chuckles]
Eric (as January): -- I could just kind of look at the moonshine and I just kind of get a little buzzed.
[Amanda, Brandon, and Julia laugh]
Eric: This is great.
Amanda: Julia, what is – what does Hitomi think of the whole scene?
Julia: I don't know.
Amanda: Does she know about Val’s identity?
Julia: No, Val has not told Hitomi that they are superhero.
Eric: Yes. I was gonna ask you. So, you know, how do you tell Hitomi that everybody – how everybody knows each other? I think Hitomi is just like --
Eric (as Hitomi): So, who – babe, who is every – who is everybody here? How do you know them?
Julia (as Val): Just like you know when you live in Lake Town City for – you know, since you were a kid.
Eric (as Hitomi): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): You, you know people.
Eric (as Hitomi): Yeah.
Julia: Is Hitomi from Lake Town City originally?
Eric: No, Hitomi is actually from Seattle --
Julia: Okay.
Eric: -- and has moved to Lake Town City for – we haven't talked about her job or anything.
Julia: Like, coder. She's like a coder, I feel.
Eric: Yeah, I think she just like work – I think everybody in Lake Town City is still like a little bit of a company town in this way. I think she just, like, does very tech things for Moral Corp.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: She's like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Oh, yeah, I build. I build.
Amanda: Like, a system’s engineer. Something like that.
Eric: Yeah, like, one of those jobs that you know is, like, complicated, but you have no idea what it actually – what they do.
Julia: Yeah, it works out.
Eric: Yeah, she's – yeah, she's definitely a coder. And she's like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Oh, yeah, I guess – yeah, I mean it's kind of like a thing where everybody is in your neighborhood. But these – this mix of people make no sense at all.
Julia (as Val): Yeah. No, I mean it's like my mom knew Aggie’s parents and I met Milo through Aggie.
[Brandon chuckles]
Julia (as Val): And – yeah. And then – yeah.
Eric (as Hitomi): And you aren’t that really close just from that, I guess.
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Eric (as Hitomi): So, surprising. I don't hang out with any people my parents’ friends also know.
Julia (as Val): Listen, it's weird because, like, you know, being – being, like, Lake Town people, you – it's a small community. We all kind of, like, just know each other. It’s like – it's like you know how you become friends with people just because you, like, live two blocks away from them and it's just easy for you to hang out? It was like that.
Eric (as Hitomi): Alright. Okay.
Eric: Make a charisma roll for me. I was gonna do you – give you disadvantage, but then you actually described it pretty okay.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: So, we're gonna do straight.
Julia: Is this just charisma or is it like deception?
Eric: It can be deception --
Julia: Okay.
Eric: -- if you're really trying to lie.
Julia: I rolled a 16.
Eric: Cool.
Julia: If it's just regular charisma, it's 18 because that’s plus two.
Eric: That's fine.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: That's totally fine. Yeah. Hitomi is like --
Eric (as Hitomi): Alright, cool. Yeah, that's – that's weird I guess. There are only a few – for just – for such a big city, I guess, there's only, like, a few schools. So, like --
Julia (as Val): Yeah, there's, like, three high schools.
Eric (as Hitomi): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): Like, we all know each other. Weird.
Eric (as Hitomi): So weird. Yeah, so weird.
Eric: Alright. Yeah, [Inaudible 45:11].
Julia (as Val): And, like, I didn't go to Guga or like the STEM school or anything. So --
Eric: Hmm. I didn't go to Guga.
Julia (as Val): Oh, I didn't go to Guga. I just got my, my Communications Degree from [Inaudible 45:22] Lake Town City. And that’s all I did.
Eric: Across the room, that sparks Quinn and Taylor to start talking about how many Stromboli is Lady Gaga can eat in one seating.
Julia: That’s incredible.
Eric: It’s a lot.
Julia: Information that I need to know. I will revisit that later.
Eric: Listen, she's just an Italian girl from New Jersey. So, it just --
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: It is what it is. Wonderful. Okay. Cool. So, I think that this is – the party's really getting going. This is like later on in the night.
Julia: Val is drunk enough that they're just like --
Julia (as Val): I will lift anyone in this room --
Brandon: Milo raised his hand.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia (as Val): -- over my head.
Brandon: Milo raised his hand.
Julia (as Val): Milo goes first.
Eric: Lucas pushes Milo aside. He goes first.
[Brandon, Julia, and Amanda laugh]
Julia (as Val): I just pick up Lucas and start doing, like, military presses.
Eric: And Lucas is like --
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, hell yeah. Love this. This is good.
Eric: I think, at this point, the party's going. Everyone's just having a good time. And then Aggie’s front door is thrown open. And Dr. Morrow walks in wear --
Julia (as Val): There she is.
Eric: -- wearing, like, a coat that's only made for an Arctic explorers.
[Brandon chuckles]
Eric: Like, it's so heavy and, like, has, like, so much fur on the hood.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: And she's, she’s carrying a bottle of absinthe in each hand --
[Brandon and Amanda laugh]
Eric: -- and says --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Who didn't – who didn’t invite me to the party?
Eric: And January is like --
Eric (as January): We love you, Morrow.
Eric: And Dez is like --
Amanda (as Aggie): Dr. Morrow.
Eric (as Dez): That’s how – that’s how it happens.
Julia: It’s very good.
Amanda (as Aggie): I silently take her coat.
Brandon: Yeah, Milo gets up to greet her and takes the bottle of absinthe away from her.
Julia: Val just goes --
Julia (as Val): Share that – share it with me.
Eric: You’ll need more to share. You already have to share it.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm gonna to, like, steer her into the kitchen under the guise of, like, getting her a plate --
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda (as Aggie): -- or water, or something and be like, “We are going to talk in detail about where you've been for the last week and a half. But, until then, please enjoy my party filled with friends and family, who are regular people.”
Eric: Hmm. Hmm.
Julia: Definitely a twist there.
[Brandon chuckles]
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, yeah. Also, my sister, she, she knows Taylor Swift. Anyway, it's fine. Go ahead.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well, you, you’re the one who invited a, a sentient rabbit. So, I don't think you have any standing on who is normal people at this party.
Amanda (as Aggie): He said it was fine.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, January loves to party. He'll say anything.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: I love that.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. And, when asked you, you’ve even busy for a week and a half.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, Aggie, you worry too much. It's fine.
Amanda (as Aggie): I literally saw a bear carrying remnants of your clothing.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, I really like that jacket.
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Amanda (as Aggie): Like I said, we can revisit this later. But I, I can --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I can tell you right now. I'm right here. Wait. It’s a party. They're doing stuff. You might as well be a soundproof, soundproof room. Like, here, it's like this. There's a secret jail where we keep all of the villains. No, it is just like the clattering of party. See, nobody cares.
[Julia and Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Is that true?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No. No, it's not true. It's not true.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay. But --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): But I would – that would have been a bad thing if people had heard that, but it's not true.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sure. Um, how are you? How did you get away from that bear?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, great. I'm super good. Actually, like a – so, it was the skis. I am very fast. And, also, I, I used my – from my time studying with the Matadors of España --
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): -- I used my jacket as a – as a device to distract the bear when I realized it was – this was, in fact, a fake bear and not a real bear. It doesn't act as bears. Obviously, are distracted like that in the programming with – don't worry. Don't worry about it. The point is I got way. Lost the jacket, unfortunately.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm glad you're well.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah. No, me too. No, I’m great. We should let – let’s, like – yeah, like, fuck up a good guy.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. No, it's – it's bad.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): He just – he hates me so much. I hope it's, like, for the normal reasons and not for, like, a thing I did.
[Julia laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You know, like, you're on the internet and you're like, “Oh, they hate me because, like, I'm a powerful woman. It's like classic internet. But, like, I do a thing that ruined his life because it's a guy. You know, it's a guy. Like, Gutenberg.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Like, so, did I ruin his life through a thing I did instead of just like, oh, my god, he hates me because a woman in power and authority, you know? You know – you know, how it is.
Amanda (as Aggie): It's definitely worse when you did something.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah. It's like you and that council guy. He hate – shit.
Amanda (as Aggie): Thanks for reminding me.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Sorry. It's not like a work thing. It's like always a work thing. I – my head always is gonna go. So, it's like a work thing.
Amanda (as Aggie): I get it. It's a lifestyle for you. Yeah, I mean I, I'll – I'll defend what I did. It's still – it’s, you know, a bummer, but I had to do it.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah. Oh, wooh. Um, thank you for not letting the museum crashed out. There's some stuff in there that would have been bad.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. Why is the only way to override the city electrics in your locked office in a locked museum?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No, there were other ones, but it got ripped out by the bear.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm just saying maybe a few more fail safes, a few people --
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): -- contacts, you know, some of – some wireless devices perhaps that we or you or some keepers can keep on them.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, wait. Oh, that's actually a good point. Which – you didn't hit all the key fobs, did you?
Amanda (as Aggie): No, just, just the one.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Which one?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yellow.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Just the yellow one. You didn't hit the red one, the blue – or the blue one?
Amanda (as Aggie): No, because, knowing that that button turned on the power for the entire city, I can only imagine what the fire and/or water ones do.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yes, those are the fire ones and the water ones.
Julia: Oh, no.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Can I have --
Amanda (as Aggie): Don’t you say that.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Can I have – can I have it? Do you have it? Do you have it?
Amanda (as Aggie): Can you tell me what they do?
Eric: She takes up mug like a new – I assume you have, like, the little hooks and she, like, grabs a mug, pours a bunch of absinthe into it, takes it as a full shot. And then she’s like --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay. The blue one? Now, don't tell anybody this. Don't tell this. But – and don’t tell January. He's gonna be so mad.
[Julia chuckles]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): The blue one orders like $50 worth of sushi.
Amanda (as Aggie): And the red one?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You don't want to know more about the, the sushi thing?
Amanda (as Aggie): I, I know what I need to know about that one.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay. Cool. You know why I gave it to you because I get it to the – to the office and then January gets mad because we usually eat sushi together. But, sometimes, I want sushi for lunch and others I don’t.
Amanda (as Aggie): Right, right, right.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Right. The red one is for emergencies.
Julia: Can you real insight on this?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. Or can I persuade her to tell me more?
Eric: Yeah, do it for insight.
[Dice roll]
Amanda (as Aggie): 15.
Eric: Okay. 15. Yeah, the blue ones probably for sushi. And the red one is probably for emergencies.
Amanda (as Aggie): I wonder what that means.
Eric: I, I don't have to tell you everything.
Amanda (as Aggie): Alright. Well, here they are. And I'm glad they did not get pushed in my pocket or anything.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda (as Aggie): And I hand them over. There on, like, a key ring in a plastic bag inside a paper bag that I got.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Wonderful. Great.
Julia: It’s drugs. There's drugs in there.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Wait. Where's the – where's the – where's the lockbox?
Amanda (as Aggie): That's all I had. Is there other, like, important stuff in there?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, yeah. Um, yeah, just some, some stuff. Who found – who found it first if it wasn't you? I assumed it was you because – oh, I didn't leave the key. Ah, I didn't replace that.
Amanda (as Aggie): No.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Did you get the note that said haha and gotcha and next time?
Amanda (as Aggie): Sure did.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Ahhh, I should have --
Amanda (as Aggie): Sure yelled at that.
[Julia laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I need to replace that.
Amanda (as Aggie): It was an – it was a close thing and I – to be honest, I don't know who got it first. It was all pretty mixed up. I'll – I’ll ask the folks though.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, there was just – it was in a lockbox that had some other stuff in it. And that whole thing was gone. So, I mean it might have just been, like, in the rubble or got moved around, but I just – if you know where it is, just let me know.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. No, I'll ask these guys when they're not drunk on Dez’s moonshine. Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Mhmm. That's a good shit. It's called – we call it Dez’s shine.
Amanda (as Aggie): Wow.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Get it? Because it's a – it's a combination of Dez’s name and moonshine.
Amanda (as Aggie): Have you ever wanted to meet Taylor Swift, Dr. Morrow?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I would love that.
Amanda (as Aggie): She's right by the fireplace.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Man, Red got me so – through some times. Oh, Taylor.
[Julia laughs]
Brandon: You look over and Milo has stood up. And, from, like, eight feet away from Taylor's, he goes --
Brandon (as Milo): Taylor, I could get you to the museum after hours.
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Also, I don't think this is – I don't think this is absinthe.
Julia: Val’s just steering him away very, very shortly out of the room.
Brandon (as Milo): Do you want some?
Julia (as Val): Alright. Let's go outside. Yes.
Brandon (as Milo): [Inaudible 54:07].
Eric: And Quinn is coming over to you. He’s like – Quinn is coming over to you. He’s like --
Eric (as Quinn): This would be such a cool time for you to --
Brandon (as Milo): How do you feel about ghosts?
Eric (as Quinn): It's should be such a cool time for you to fly right now. You should actually --
Julia (as Val): No. No, we’re going outside.
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn, what the fuck?
Brandon (as Milo): Quinn.
Eric (as Quinn): Hey, Milo said he could fly. I want to see him fly.
Brandon (as Milo): Yes. As, as --
Julia (as Val): No, we’re not flying.
Brandon (as Milo): As Val, like, pushes me outside, my left --
Julia (as Val): I’m grappling you.
Brandon (as Milo): My left leg turns into gas but nothing else.
[Eric and Julia laugh]
Julia (as Val): Incredible.
Eric: Val, you’ve pushed Milo outside and Lucas follows closely behind. And Lucas is like --
Eric (as Lucas): Hey, Val, can you just, like – can you just give us a second?
Julia (as Val): Yes. Can you make sure that he – well, can you just make sure he stays still, I guess?
Brandon: Milo is just, like, leaning to the left.
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can – I can – I’m going – I’ll do my – yeah, I can do that.
Julia (as Val): Alright. Okay. Alright.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
Julia: And Val goes back inside.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks, Val. Val, thank you.
Julia (as Val): You're welcome, Milo.
Eric: So, this is like – I don’t – this is like four drink Milo, right?
Brandon (as Milo): Luke, Luke. Can I call you Luke?
Eric (as Lucas): It's already happening.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Brandon (as Milo): Do you think Apple and Zak are kissing?
Eric (as Lucas): What? Our good friends Apple and Zak? Zakary Rose?
Brandon (as Milo): I think they’re kissing.
Eric (as Lucas): I don't – that doesn't really make any sense.
Brandon (as Milo): You, you know what Battlestar Galactica does to people, Luke.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric (as Lucas): Gross, but true. Okay. Um, hey.
Brandon (as Milo): Shhh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.
Eric (as Lucas): Are you – did you put your hand up? You’re like you put your hand on his face?
Brandon (as Milo): I did. Look at my leg.
Eric: Hey, Lucas looks down. And it's, like, invisible. He's like --
Eric (as Lucas): You're such a fucking idiot. You're so bad at hiding those stuff.
Brandon (as Milo): Luke, Luke, I got – I got --
Eric (as Lucas): I saw you fake – I – you fucking --
Eric: He punches you in the arm.
Eric (as Lucas): I saw you phase through a door. And then you lied to – about it to my face.
Brandon (as Milo): You saw me? I didn't – you didn’t --
Eric (as Lucas): I was stand – yeah. You – remember when you said – first of all, you came at – first of all, fuck – oh, that, that was you? Fuck. You’re with the – with the kid gal? That – of course. Oh, my god. It was you with – yes, you saw some guy with ghosts powers came and told me to – told me see this and told me to stay put. And then you showed up randomly. And I was like, “What?” And then you ran away. And then I was like, “What's Milo doing?” And I saw you phase through a door.
Brandon (as Milo): Luke is just saying a lot of words right now.
[Amanda chuckles]
Eric: He punches you again.
Brandon (as Milo): You want to see a ghost cat?
Eric (as Lucas): Yes. What?
Brandon (as Milo): Here, here touch my shoulder.
Eric: He puts a hand on your shoulder. And then Tuna’s like --
Eric (as Tuna): Oh, oh, you finally talked about your feelings, you dumb bitch.
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Eric: And Lucas is like --
Eric (as Lucas): What? Oh, my god. That's your cat. That cat died, like, three years ago.
Brandon (as Milo): I know. It's really annoying that it's still around.
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, my god. You're – I'm sure your dad loves that. So --
Brandon (as Milo): No, my dad doesn't know. Don't tell him anything.
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, okay. So, okay, who, who, who knows?
Brandon (as Milo): You.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): I have tried to impress Quinn --
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): -- on multiple occasions.
Eric (as Lucas): Right.
Brandon (as Milo): It’s not gone well. I think I lost my chances with Taylor.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
[Everybody laugh]
Eric (as Lucas): Wait. So, Taylor knows you have powers?
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, I thought we were talking about my love life. What? What?
Eric (as Lucas): No, my god. Alright. Okay.
Julia: There's you.
Eric (as Lucas): Milo --
Brandon (as Milo): Oh.
Eric (as Lucas): -- who knows you have powers?
Brandon (as Milo): Oh. Oh. Oh. Well, Dr. Morrow does, of course. Dr. Morrow.
Eric (as Lucas): Doctor – the Mayor, Dr. Morrow, our super boss?
Brandon (as Milo): But Dr. Morrow knows everything. Haven’t you – did you not read the, the biographies that I gave you?
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): And it’s like it's close to omnipresent as you can get.
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah, that's true.
Brandon (as Milo): Um, Quinn.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Uh, Taylor doesn't.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna does.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay. So, then, if that was you there, who were the – who are the other – who's the preserver, Anvil Connie, and that girl who can --
Brandon (as Milo): Shh. Shh. Shh.
Eric (as Lucas): And who can stick to walls with the mask?
[Amanda chuckles]
Brandon (as Milo): It's a secret.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: He punches you again. You --
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Lucas): Milo, I swear to fucking god. You already lied to me once. Who are they?
Brandon (as Milo): I didn’t – I, I'm not lying to you now. I'm protecting people and you.
Eric (as Lucas): You just lied to my face. I'm your best friend and you lied to me that you had powers. I said, “Milo, this is your chance.” [Inaudible 58:55] and you didn’t.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I lied then. I'm not lying now. Now, I’m just protecting.
Eric (as Lucas): Ooh, fuck. Okay. So, you are – like, I got to know --
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t want you to get hurt.
Eric (as Lucas): You – I’m not gonna get – who’s gonna hurt me?
Brandon (as Milo): If people know that you know things, then, like, they're gonna come after you to get to me or all the other folks.
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, my god. Does that make me your Lois Lane?
[Julia and Brandon laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, it does.
Julia: Goddess.
Eric (as Lucas): A goddess. I look so bad in a pencil skirt, you fucking asshole.
Brandon (as Milo): I think you look great. It really highlights your delts.
Eric: He punches you three times.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric (as Lucas): You’re such a – oh, my god. Alright. Don't lie to me again. One, don't lie to me again. Tell me when this stuff happens. I’m already in.
Brandon (as Milo): I took your Swiss last week. I'm sorry.
Eric (as Lucas): Great. Not about everything just about power things, please.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, okay.
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah. And, two, oh, god, just don't do anything that will get you hurt, okay?
Brandon (as Milo): When have I ever done anything to get anyone – come on. Let's go talk to Taylor.
Eric: He punches you in the stomach and walks inside.
[Everybody laugh]
Eric: Aggie, you throw a great party. And it didn't --
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Eric: It wasn't just because Taylor Swift showed up.
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you. I send everybody home with a handmade peppermint bark.
Eric: Oh, yeah.
Brandon: Ooh. As Milo's wrapping up at the party helping, you know, in his head,’ he's trying – he's helping clean up, but really he's just sort of, like --
Julia (as Val): Not at all.
Brandon: -- moving one cup to another area and then --
[Everybody laugh]
Brandon: And then, you know, back. And he's like --
Brandon (as Milo): Val, Val, pick me up.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia (as Val): Wait. Like, like carry you? You want to be carried?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I want to be – Val, pick me up.
Julia (as Val): Like a – like a baby?
Brandon (as Milo): No, like, like, a strong – like, a strong thing.
Julia (as Val): Oh, okay. Okay.
Eric: Lucas says --
Eric (as Lucas): Pick him up like a wife carry a guy.
Julia (as Val): Okay. Over the shoulders into a fireman carry.
Julia: So, Val lets Milo down. And, like, as he's heading out the door, Val is just, like --
Julia (as Val): Alright. Hold on. How did you get here? Do I need to take your keys?
Julia: And just like goes into his pocket to grab his keys.
Brandon (as Milo): No, I don't even have – I, I have a house key. And it – there's – I have a key to my, my expensive comic books. I have the key --
Julia (as Val): There’s a whole key to your expensive comic books?
Brandon (as Milo): They’re in a lockbox. I – don’t --
Julia (as Val): Alright. Alright.
Brandon (as Milo): Shh. Don’t tell anyone that.
Julia (as Val): Alright.
Brandon (as Milo): And I got the key to the museum, but I just – I don't – I just – you know.
Julia (as Val): Can I sleight of hand it?
Eric: Yeah, roll, roll sleight of hand to check Milo's pockets.
Julia (as Val): Rolled 19 plus four.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, my god.
Eric: Yeah, baby. You get in there and you take all of my loose keys.
Julia (as Val): Alright.
Eric: Yeah. Milo, do you have the locket and the ID card on you?
Brandon (as Milo): In different pockets, but yeah.
Eric: Yeah, I think that you, you swiped them.
Julia: Yeah, I, I don't think Val understands, like, what they are. And I think that they probably assume that the ID card is, like, Milo's ID card for the museum.
Eric: Mhmm.
Julia: But the locket kind of catches their interest and they kind of, like, slip that into their pocket being like --
Julia (as Val): No, alright. Not like – not like I'm gonna steal and pawn this, but this seems like a weird thing to --
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): -- to have in your pocket.
Julia: And then returns Milo's keys be like --
Julia (as Val): Alright. Make sure you take like a rideshare home or --
Brandon (as Milo): Taylor, do you need a ride?
Julia (as Val): This is – okay, that's – that's too weird. Let’s – let’s get you in, like, a cab.
Brandon (as Milo): Is, is she still here?
Eric: Here's the thing. Taylor disappeared, like, 15 minutes before everybody started leaving. She Irish goodbye you all so hard.
Julia (as Val): Nice.
Amanda: Aggie whispers --
Amanda (as Aggie): I respect it.
[Eric and Julia chuckles]
Brandon (as Milo): Taylor. Val, Taylor left. I didn’t --
Julia (as Val): Yeah, it's okay. Alright. Let's get you home. Let's put you in a car.
Amanda (as Aggie): Did she follow you guys on Instagram? She followed me on Instagram.
(Eric snickers)
Julia (as Val): That's very cool.
Eric: She made an account for Sushi. And Sushi now has 100,000 Instagram followers.
[Brandon chuckles]
Julia (as Val): Incredible.
Eric: Yeah, Lucas is, once again, trying to chat up Quinn. Quinn is – I don't know if I've ever seen someone look at their phones so much and so hard.
[Julia, Brandon, and Amanda laugh]
Eric: It’s not working. But, yeah, he, you know, wraps up.
Julia: Val was just like --
Julia (as Val): Do you also need a ride, Lucas? Because you could probably go with Milo.
Eric (as Lucas): Yes, thank you, please.
Julia (as Val): Alright. I'll put you both in a cab.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Lucas): Cool.
Eric: January has done Casey at the Bat three times.
Julia (as Val): Incredible.
Eric: And Dr. Morrow puts an arm over January’s shoulder and an arm over Dez’s shoulder. She’s like --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Come on, boys. We’re heading home.
[Everyone laughs]
Brandon: That’s normal.
Eric: Yeah. And then they just walk out into the night. And, yeah, there you go. Aggie, your house is once again party less.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, ears ring. I really enjoy putting all the stuff away. I put on some Allman Brothers, some Doobie Brothers. Just mix them all up.
[Brandon, Julia, and Eric laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): And then tomorrow's I’ll just text everyone to thank them for coming.
Eric: Yeah. You then realize that Quinn has fallen asleep on the floor in your kitchen.
Amanda (as Aggie): We have a procedure for this.
[Julia and Eric laugh]
Amanda (as Aggie): I pick her up, put her on the couch, put a blanket over, take her shoes off, and plug her phone in.
Eric: While she's in your arms, she's like – she wakes up for a second and she's like --
Eric (as Quinn): What if I – what if they called me sticky girl?
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Keep trying. We'll find one.
Eric (as Quinn): Okay. Val didn’t like sticky hands.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think we can do better.
Eric (as Quinn): Okay. Maybe we just need to keep the word sticky. [Snores]
[Brandon and Amanda laugh]
Eric: Wonderful. Alright. So, that is December. And, when New Year's happens it is 20XX plus one. Happy 20XX plus one. Let's do some entanglements y'all.
Brandon: Yay.
Amanda: Whoa.
Eric: So, Aggie, this is something that you suggested during the meeting episode a few episodes back. It is your New Year's resolution to have some sort of, like, awareness or patrol to your being around. Just, like, waiting for someone to throw the proverbial bat signal in there.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, I want to get more proactive from the sense of, like, I don't want to show up like we’d had to at SUNY and be in a disaster that's halfway in the making. But, also, just to stay more in touch with other people in my life besides my superhero friends because it's been a lot of that for a while. So, I think I, probably, on, like, two or three days after New Year's, text some friends or, like, go visit some people that I know in various neighborhoods.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda (as Aggie): Like, I know, you know, the clerk at one of the Astros really well. I know the guy that maintains the, like, giant mountain lobster sign, which requires a lot of maintenance because it’s very old.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: True.
Amanda (as Aggie): So, I think I just kind of, like, mine my network, you know, and, like, try to come up with some contacts that I can ask to just kind of keep me posted on how things are going in their sector.
Eric: Wonderful.
Brandon: Mountain lobster Joe. He's the one that takes care of it.
Eric: I like – I like that you have a community network now. I do think that this takes a lot of time and effort on your part.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: So, like, this is, now, I don't know if you have any free time. I don't know if you had any before, but, like, you just don't have any free time. And that's something that you just – will come up later, but I have no mechanical penalty for you right now. But, first, I will give you the choice of which of these things will happen because you might have been the first one for it to come upon. So, here's what we're going to do. The three of you are going to roll 3D10 like we do usually. And then I will give you a little bit of clues of – and, Aggie, you’ll go first and you can pick. Just go after these little clues about which one you want to do.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Julia (as Val): I got 8, 3, 2.
Brandon (as Milo): 1, 2, 6.
Amanda (as Aggie): 3, 7, 5.
Eric: Great. So, Aggie, I'm just gonna give you the places because of your community outreach. These things are happening over the entire winter. So, these are happening in different times. This is more about just – Amanda, you can pick which one of these things. There seems to be a large crowd gathering at one of the parks in the city. There seems to be some criminal activity happening at the Thornhill Coffee Shop. Like, the prime one. I don't know if you've been --
[Brandon chuckles]
Eric: -- in New York City. There's that really, really fancy Starbucks on, like, Eighth Avenue that's like, “This is where the roasting happens.” It's, like, so elaborate. And, so, so, this is, like, the flagship Thornhill Coffee Store. And then someone throw – doing some strange stuff at Dr. Morrows house.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think I'll go with the crowd.
Eric: Okay. We'll start with that one. So, Aggie, this is like, in January, it's still bitter cold.
Amanda: I'm sorry. I have to interrupt you. What does the January do during January? Is it, like, his birthday month?
Eric: Yeah, it's his birthday month.
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: Yeah, he, he declares it his birthday month and he just, like, parties all, all month.
Brandon: What a good rabbit.
Amanda (as Aggie): I make him a sweater that has, like in the periodic table styling, a J – a big J and a little Y.
Eric: Ooh.
Amanda (as Aggie): Like, that’s his element. Yeah.
Eric: I love that.
Julia: Aww.
Eric: That’s just so good. That's so adorable. Alright. So, this is January – middle of January. It's like bitter cold. But still, in Lake Town City, as long as the wind chill isn't below zero, we can still go, go outside, right? So, you're at one of the public parks nearby. And there seems to be, like, a gathering of people surrounding. And someone has put an old-timey stagecoach in the middle of the public park.
Amanda (as Aggie): Interesting. I'm gonna just, like, amble up and take a look.
Eric: You're wearing your preserver costume, right?
Amanda (as Aggie): I am, yeah. But I'm kind of keeping my, my head down and I have like a big parka. So, I feel like I'm semi incognito.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): But I have my – like, my hat is shielding my face.
Eric: Yeah. And I think go – then he goes like, “Per, per, per, per, per, per. Introducing the new wonder drug rom Painkiller Larson and Big Jeff.” And stepping out of the stage coach is what looks to be a mid-30s white man with long, scraggly hair and a white cowboy hat, riding a brown grizzly bear. And he’s like --
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): Hello y’all. My name is Painkiller Larson. I'm the best doctor this side of the Mississippi, but don't let the mainstream media tell you about that. And this right here is my good friend, Big Jeff. Big Jeff, can you say hello? You say hello to the audience there.
Eric: And Big Jeff goes --
Eric (as Big Jeff): [Inaudible 1:08:56].
Eric: And then everyone was like, “Oh, wow. A bear that can talk. Oh, my god.” And then they call clap.
Amanda: Aggie goes --
Amanda (as Aggie): Fuck no.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): I'll tell you – listen, I know that you all have the sniffles. It’s getting cold out now. But what you can do is you can have Painkiller Larson and Big Jeff’s suppository, both for the mouth and then the other place, way of keeping the cold away. I call it My Wonder Drug.
Amanda (as Aggie): Or better yet, get your seasonal flu shots. And then I, like, walk across sort of in front of the pair – the cowboy between him and the crowd. And I'm like, “So sorry, folks. There was a permit mix up. We don't have a commercial license for the sale of things here. Also, get your flu shot and don't trust people who say the phrase mainstream media. Thank you very much. Enjoy the rest of your beautiful day here in Lake Town City.
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): Oh, it sounds that we have here – we have nice sam, someone who wants to put a needle in your body. You know who also had needles? Hellraiser who is a monster.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): Instead, you could be eating a pill or putting it in your – in the privacy of your own home in your butt.
Amanda: Can I do my emissary of peace?
[Eric laughs]
Eric: You [inaudible 1:10:06]. Well, so, how are you gonna calm the situation?
Amanda (as Aggie): I think I just want with my, like, uniformed Ranger. You know, like, I look like a parks employee and sort of send people on their way. And I'm used to dispelling kind of crowds and middle schoolers. So, hopefully, you know, this works. And then I'll turn to the – I think I’ll actually just, like, pet the bear and have the bear chill. And, at the same time, say to Painkiller Larson, “Oh, are you – did you come into town from somewhere else? Do you have a, a retail presence here on the ground?” And just try to, like, distract him into, like, a one-on-one combo.
Eric: Into talking about logistics and permits?
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, yeah.
Eric: Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, let's just do this roll. He is a resolute fella. I think you need to get a 16 to have him caught up in the minutiae of his performance.
Amanda (as Aggie): Cool. So, I'm gonna make a charisma check.
Eric: Yes, you can – yeah, you can do this persuasion because this is part of your emissary of peace.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda (as Aggie): 13 plus – that is a 17.
Julia: Yay.
Eric: Ahh, yeah.
Julia: Did it.
Eric: I, I think that you standing it out, you – he then be like --
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): Hey, I filed with the Department of Parks and I’ve a permit for demonstration and all the things.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know, I keep telling them to change that. There is the Parks Department and then there is the Department of Parks and Wildlife. And those two things, confusingly, are different. Which one did you do? Do you have this receipt in your email maybe?
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): I mean I can go look in the stagecoach. I got – hold on.
Eric: And then he goes back in the stagecoach and has to argue with Aggie. And, while you're doing that, the crowd disperses. He’d be like --
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): No, wait. I have all these things. I got pills. I have syrup. I have little tiny mushrooms you can just pop into your mouth. Now, please, it's all – it's all perfectly nature. Why? Wait. God. Lady, lady, you have a lot of nerve coming in here and --
[Brandon snickers]
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): You have a lot of nerve coming in here and ruining my legitimate business.
Amanda (as Aggie): Unless you are literally from the 1830s, I have no sympathy for quacks.
Eric (as Painkiller Larson): Goddamn it. Let's – let's rock, Big Jeff. Charge.
Eric: [Inaudible 1:12:01].
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): I think I stand there with my hands on my hips for a good five minutes just kind of watching him go.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Eric: Wonderful. Okay. Milo, this is, like, the beginning of February. It's like it's just snowed in. And it's like, also, raining a little bit. It's just wet and gross and, like, chills you down to the bone as if you're dead. No pun intended.
[Eric and Julia laugh]
Eric: You go over to Dr. Morrow’s place and she's like --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, my god, think. Ugh, I just like – I don't have enough time to deal with this. And it's ruining my whole day. Can you just look?
Eric: And she points to, like, in her office. There, she has a big screen. There's a person with a plague doctor mask on screen --
Brandon: Nooo. No.
Eric: -- reading. It looks like it's a – it's one of those – it’s – it's like someone sent her a VHS tape and, like, she just playing this video. Someone's like – she’s like --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Someone play this video. And I don't know what to do. And I cannot handle it.
Eric: The guy's wearing a plague doctor mask with just a gray, like, flannel suit on.
Brandon: No.
Eric: He also has a big yellow pad and a big black marker and in, like, the garbled, like, computer voice says --
Eric (as the mask guy): Dr. Morrow, I've seen when you are going to die. It is within the year. I know the actuary.
Eric: And it’s then he turns the pad around. And he, he's written, “Dr. Morrow will die this year,” on it. And, right now, it's just a video.
Brandon (as Milo): Well, Dr. Morrow, if there's one thing – one evil in this world that I would like to defeat, it's math. So, math and statistics, how do I solve this problem for you?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Can you just like – am I gonna die this year? Can you figure this out?”
Brandon (as Milo): No, you're not gonna die. Why would you die this year? This, this guy [Inaudible 1:13:46] --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): The actuary said so.
Brandon (as Milo): He just wrote it on a legal pad. Who cares?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): When I get a video – well, when I get a video saying I'm gonna die this year, it usually freaks me out.
Brandon (as Milo): Well, I understand that, but I'm saying it's not accurate. Do you know where this guy is?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No, I just got the video.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay. Well, it's my best approach here then to just, like, distract her with a good, cool movie or something.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: So – well, yeah, if you want to just, like, just distract her, I'll give you roll performance to try to make her feel better.
Brandon: Would dispel magic do anything on this video?
Eric: That's perfect. I actually love that. Yeah, let's do this spell magic.
Brandon: So, Milo’s like --
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, okay. Just – it's gonna be okay. This is all BS.
Brandon: And then he, like, waves his hand over the VHS tape. You see – and you see two little ghost hands just go in there like little – like little elves and just, like, manipulate the tape.
Eric: I like that. It's like looking to see if this is actual prognostication. I love that. Let's say that this is a fifth level spell. So, make a DC15 check for your spell casting ability. Just straight up. Brandon: Yeah.
[Dice roll]
Brandon: 13 plus seven for 20.
Eric: Wonderful.
Julia: Nice.
Eric: So, it’s 20. So, the ghost hands go in there and it, like, looks all around. It was looking for this actual prediction and prognostication. Hey, there's nothing there. This isn't – it's just someone was a jerk and sent a videotape to Dr. Morrow to freak her out.
Brandon (as Milo): I explained that Dr. Morrow. Like, this is nothing This is just a literal tape. So, some, some asshole may come after you, but you have three superheroes and a Dez and a January around. I think it'll be okay.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Ugh, that's a good point. You know, I just haven't really felt secure since someone – I don't know what happened, like, in the time that's, you know, someone broke into my office and took, like, some precious stuff from me. So, I’ve just been feeling a little – a little shaken up.
Brandon (as Milo): Who broke into your – what do you mean?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It was like when around the MM – when the, the the bear, the 8-bit bear was trying to destroy the, the museum. It's just like I had some valuables in there. I, I assume that something messed up. It – nothing's been – it hasn't turned up in the month since then. So, I just don’t know.
Brandon (as Milo): Were they, like, dangerous? Or, like, do we need to look out for them?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No, like, purse. Just personal stuff. That's what really freaks me out.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, okay.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Like, what was it?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow: You know, it's kind of private, Milo. I just --
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): The point is thank you. I appreciate – I, this – I call the guy who can talk to ghosts to tell me if I'm going to die.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): That's a good policy to have.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's good. And, hey, I'm not gonna die this year. That's a good thing to know.
Brandon (as Milo): Not this year.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Not this year.
[Julia laughs]
Julia: Oh, Jesus.
Brandon: And Milo winks.
Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Morrow is like --
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Haha. I like the dark humor.
Eric: And she winks back. Wonderful. Alright. Let's do Val. Aggie texts you and is like --
Eric (as Aggie): Hey, I got – something happening at Thornhill Coffee Prime.
Eric: It's – she just get sent there. And she’s like --
Eric (as Aggie): We didn’t have a lot of details on it. It's just like something bad was happening.
Eric: So, you go down there and it’s just like it's all glass windows. And, like, you just see people running around in there. Like, stomping all over the opulence. Like, kicking over these coffee tables and, like, jumping off of these tufted seats.
Julia (as Val): Oh, hell yeah. Punk as hell.
[Eric and Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yeah, one of – one of the glass walls is broken because you see that there is a – there is, like, a fully-masked figure inside that’s wearing a hockey mask. So, like, a goalie mask because you can't see what they look like.
Julia: It’s Jason.
Eric: Yeah. And they were – they're just wearing, like, sweatpants and a sweatshirt. And they were running around this – the Thornhill Coffee. And it looks like – you hear, like, a vacuuming sound. Like, a vooooo. Like, a sucking. And then you see that, like, as they turn towards one of the, like, five coffee bars in there, all of the coffee and all of the coffee cake and pastries are just flying towards them and going into the hockey mask.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: This vooo, vovv, vovv and just keeps sucking all of it up. And there's a barista, like, runs past you and, like --
Eric (as the barista): They're eating everything. There's not coffee – there’s not gonna be any coffee left.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Alright, Val walks in and is like --
Julia (as Val): You know, fucking stop!
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yeah, they just – they ignore you and go over to, like, one of the, the other coffee bars. That's where they only have espresso and then just start sucking up all of the espresso.
Julia (as Val): How big is the hole in which they are sucking things into?
Eric: They're sucking it into their face. So, it is going, like, into and through the hockey mask.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric: Which I guess has, like, the – if there was, like, a grate, it has, like, that ripped out.
Julia: I think what Val is gonna do is grab, like, a serving tray. You know, like a waitress would carry drinks on. And just kind of press it up against their mouth so it gets stuck.
Eric: I love that. So, I'm gonna roll plus three because that's their sucking ability.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So, then you can do strength.
Julia: Cool. I'm raging. So --
Eric: Wonderful.
[Dice roll]
Julia: That's 13.
Eric: Okay, I got a 14.
Julia: Damn it.
Eric: So, you press the, the tray into their face and they, “Oomph. Oomph.” And then it's like someone kicked a vacuum into higher gear. It goes, “Vooov. Voo,” and eats the tray. And then sprints away from you just sucking the rest of the food up in this Thornhill Prime and then runs away through the front door.
Julia (as Val): I guess I’ll tackle them --
Eric: Yeah, do it
Julia (as Val): -- before they leave. Sure.
[Dice roll]
Julia (as Val): I rolled an 18.
Eric: Wonderful. Okay. Yeah, you – as they try to run away, you tackle them to the ground.
Julia (as Val): I think I just angled their face upward so that there's nothing --
Eric: Yeah.
Julia (as Val): -- like, in the path of their sucking.
Eric: Vooov. Voov. They're sucking into the air. I think, eventually, as someone, like, tries to get restraints on them, I want you to make a perception check.
Julia: Perception. I’m not good at that.
[Dice roll]
Julia: Ah, it’s a six.
Eric: Okay. I’m just trying to figure out what to – what to do next. And Dr. Morrow walks you through where they put the people who cause crimes with powers. You look back and you hear voomph. And you look and you see that their hands are free because they just ate their restraints.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): What?
Eric: And then they book it and they're just gone.
Julia (as Val): Nooo!
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Eric: On Seven and a Half News, it’s Vulcani gets eaten up by eating villain?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: That’s the lead story.
Julia: This is what happens when I don't just knock people out.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: This is not a meditation on spring. This is not a meditation on the world blooming after winter. This is not a meditation on feeling like the world is coming back to life or taking off your jacket like a snake shedding its skin, sloughing off love sick February, and lion tooth march to reveal your better self underneath. It's not. Don't worry. This is not a story about looking at flowers. The beautiful yellows and pinks and purples that now populate the former whites. Some might call it paint on a blank canvas or music filling a musical staff. I'm not. That's not what this is. This is also not a warning from state parks and state lands and elsewhere to leave wild plants and flowers alone no matter how much you want to take them with you. And the New York Protective Native Plants Program created in 1989 is not a metaphor for enjoying wonder in its own place and how humanity has to touch instead of just looking, children at a museum. This is about looking at the flora up close, the delicate white petals that are named the bloodroot, the yellow clusters of the wild parsnip that leave you vulnerable to the nastiest sunburns for years to come, the spring beauty, which basically looks all pink. But, when you get right down close to it, you realize the flower is white with pink stripes, barcodes almost. But it's nature. So, it's not. Though, this could be about the other things as well. Spring is a bouquet arranged by a blind florist, but it's sweet you got me flowers at all.

Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to the After Party for Episodes 15 and 16. These are the ones that we had just recorded a few APs ago where we were like, “You guys don't even know what's happening next --
Julia: Ooh.
Amanda: -- and then it happened.
[Brandon laugs]
Amanda: So, I'm very excited to talk about it.
Julia: Me too.
Eric: I just like making an actual blizzard happen after teasing a blizzard would happen.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Now, it's actually happening and I'm just not – I'm not like, “You look at an onion. Looks weird.”
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: An onion, huh?
Eric: It's weird smelling.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: You roll all your bird bones and then it says, “What? Snow?”
Julia: You mean my girlfriend’s – my girlfriend's bones?
Amanda: What?
Eric: No, this is the bird bone witch --
Julia: Oh, okay.
Eric: -- from the Midroll a little while ago.
Julia: Gotcha.
Eric: You don't need a therapist if you have a bird bone witch.
Brandon: But, also, your girlfriend's bones, we do roll those.
Julia: We do.
Amanda: Well, we have lots of questions from the JTP audience. But, first, Julia and Brandon, I'm sure you guys have some things to ask. I wrote down from Episode 15 the quote, “Would you say snow is water?”
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Julia: That’s a good one.
Amanda: Which I just thought was really charming.
Eric: I, yeah, know, man. Dungeon and Dragons is lovely because everything is flexible. So, you know what the answer? Yes, snow is water. So, I do want Milo’s ghost hand hanging out the backside of his best friend’s ride trying to holler at the snow.
Brandon: No scrubs. No snobs. That's nothing.
Julia: Hmm. That's nothing. No.
Eric: The, the funny thing about making challenging things for your players is that you might think it's challenging in your head, but then they do one interesting thing and that becomes much easier. But, like, it's not a big deal. Like, if I really wanted the car to crash, I would make it crash --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- and, you know, have a bear bite a piece out of said truck. I don't need the car to crash into a snow pile for you all to have fun. So, like, that was just really innovative.
Brandon: You have a weird definition of fun.
Julia: Quote unquote.
Eric: Oh, you love it. You love it.
Amanda: Eric, I have so many questions about the mechanics of this episode. I would love to know about blizzard mechanics. I would love to know about that vehicle table, the mishap table? And, also, what the fuck is happening with those bears? Julia, do you have any insight here? You're the one who rolled the great roll.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Just I know that the, the bears are the same bears. That's all I know. I don't know if they're clones.
Eric: It's the same bear. That's all you know.
Julia: Same bear.
Eric: I – something I also love about Dungeons and Dragons is that, when the players roll to understand things, I really do like tailoring it to the specific roll you're doing. Like, you could have made a few different rolls. You could have investigated. You could have perceived. This could have been Arcana if you were looking at, like, if something was really fucking weird.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: But you did nature. So, I'm like, “Alright. What – what does Val know about bears and living in upstate New York?”
Julia: Not much.
Eric: I feel like, if a bear comes on your property, you’re like, “Oh, no, I know that bear. It has a spot on it and a scar on its – on its paw.” You’d be like, “Oh, that's the same bear.” So I feel like that was the kind of thing and also making it a nature check was a little bit more interesting. You’d be like, “Yeah, you look at that fucking bear. It's there and it’s standing in the road.”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Something really funny was, in my mind, of Aggie really, really slowly driving around the bear like a kid doing --
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: -- trying to parallel park for the first time.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Yep.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Brandon: I mean, as you say, you don't want to scare a bear with your big car. Be nice to bears.
Amanda: Don’t run them over.
Eric: Listen, if you ding the bear, that is, like, two points on your license.
Brandon: That’s true.
Julia: That’s true. It’s almost an auto fail. You got to get one more point.
[Everyone laugh]
Eric: Ah, yeah, let me tell you about some tables, my friends. I want to talk about the vehicle table. So, this was just the possible vehicles that could have been in – I actually had a few different – I had a few different things that could have happened.
Brandon: If Batmobile is one of them, I'm going to leave this podcast.
Eric: It was not a Batmobile. No, it was not.
Amanda: I feel like I really fucked up in wanting to take my own car here. I feel like Eric looks so disappointed.
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: I felt like I waste time in the episode. I just – I want to – I want to just air that out with you guys.
Eric: No, that's totally fine. I was more like – that was one of the various things you could have done. So, there could have been vehicles in different places. Dr. Morrow could have had a vehicle. We could have used vehicles you already had. But, of course, that associates you with the citizen that you are. Or you could have tried to get vehicle somewhere else like knocking on doors for your neighbor, trying to steal a car, any of these other places. So, you had a lot of places that you could have taken cars from, but I also had a vehicle table and then I had a Dr. Morrow version of things. So, the vehicle table was a truck, which is just like Aggie’s struck. You just had a regular sort of four-door car. There was snowmobiles.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, you all could have rolled out on snowmobiles and took them instead.
Brandon: Oh, man.
Eric: And then there was just, like, a straight-up minivan, which has, like, high HP but not really that great steering. But then Dr. Morrow versions of it was, was the same car. She had a very similar truck to Aggie did. Her car had a hard, like, plow on it.
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: So, if you had a four-door sedan, you could have hit a button, and then a plow would have just popped up on the front of it.
Julia: Alright.
Brandon: That's neat.
Julia: That is dope.
Eric: On the snowmobile, there was a compartment for skis and a tow rope. So, if some – if someone wanted to ski behind it or you had to do some sort of flips maneuver, that would have been possible.
Brandon: Eric.
Julia: That would have been so much fun for Val.
Brandon: What? Come on.
Amanda: Amazing.
Eric: It’s there. You guys got a tank. The last thing, instead of minivan --
Julia: We did get a tank.
Eric: -- was a little tank.
Julia: We didn’t even take the tank though. I'm so mad.
Amanda: I'm still stuck on the, the snowmobiles because then there would have been much less opportunity for Milo to flirt with Quinn.
Julia: That's true.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: That's true, but also flips on skis.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I'm actually very surprised you didn't take the tank. It would have been helpful. You already saw that there was danger out there, but you did kind of go for speed or the similar thing that you had before. So, I thought that that was actually interesting. I didn't want to dissuade you from taking the tank. But the question you asked me was, “How fast is this?” And I'm like, “It's a tank.”
Brandon: Right.
Julia: Yeah, I think we prioritized speed just because we had to go back.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Julia: And, like, we felt like we were losing time. I don't know if that was just me. But I, I --
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: -- did want the tank. In character, I really wanted the tank, but, also, I want to get to the museum as soon as possible.
Brandon: That's a good question. Was there a time table on it – element to it, Eric?
Eric: There was. I think that there was something there. I think that, as what happened, you kind of ran in on Lucas while everything was fine. And then things popped off. That might have been the most “normal” situation, but that is if you did it in a timely manner.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: If you got there really quickly, maybe if you didn't fuck around with Emily Slaughter and Sour Anthony or you didn't do your Instagram side quest, you could have gotten there faster. You could have gotten there slower if things really messed up. So, you kind of got there in a timely but not, like, super prepared manner. So, vaguely. Kind of more, like, a clock that I had in my head.
Brandon: Gotcha.
Julia: But then Anise would have frozen to death and then I would have felt bad.
Brandon: That's true.
Amanda: Anise.
Eric: Oh, Anise.
Amanda: Our BFF.
Eric: My good friend. Anise – Anise works at Luke's diner somewhere at Stars Holiday.
[Everyone laugh]
Julia: Good for him.
Amanda: It's Carlos’s coworker.
Eric: Yeah. But, yeah, there was also a mishap table. If you'd had taken the sedan or you'd taken the minivan, these mishaps probably would have happened more if you had, like, hit the side of the road or if a bear ate you or destroyed that. So, you did actually get one of the mishaps. Five to save – I rolled on a D10. A five to six, your heater died, which would have had you keep getting cold rolls instead of, like, keeping you insulated. But, of course, there's instead of the heater dying, there was just a literal hole in the car. You could have had messed up steering. You could have immediately veered off. Aggie would have had to do a dexterity check to, like, keep on black – from black ice. Nine, the engine just literally would have died and you would have needed to jump. And then, if you rolled – I rolled a 10, the car, just straight up, would have flipped.
Julia: Oof.
Eric: And you had to do saving throws or take a lot of damage.
Brandon: Just like randomly? Just baaah!
Eric: I mean, like, it's not – it's – yes, Brandon, immediately, like, you're in fucking BeamN – BeamNG. They would have – you would have clipped through a barn and you would have died. Yes, Brandon, that's exactly what would have happened.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: That was fun.
Julia: I really love mishap tables. In my home game, we used it for a – like, airship battle. And, oh, my god, like, just being – having to fix stuff in the middle of a fight is so fascinating and so much fun and throws a real wrench into things. I really like that you incorporated it.
Brandon: I did.
Eric: Thank you. I think that that was Misha, right?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah, we definitely talked about that.
Brandon: So, we figured.
Eric: And, also, me when you think about it. But then, again, a lot of this stuff here is also a little bit Misha.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Eric: So, it's all kind of the same. Julia, you're all just talking about the same big game here.
Julia: Mhmm. Mhmm.
Brandon: I'm a little bit country, a little bit of Misha.
Eric: Oh, do you guys want to know the different events you could have come upon during your, your drive over to the museum?
Brandon: Yes, please.
Eric: The whole thing with the Black Diamond Diner, that was number one. And, number two, there could have been a power line down and you had to save a family that was stuck in a car there --
Julia: Whoa.
Eric: -- which would have been a little bit interesting because the car is conducting electricity. A lot of, like, not touching metal, it would have been a little bit more of a finesse mission. I was actually really interested in that and some of the stats on that. And, like, really making you do superhero stuff would have been fun. Three was the one that you saw the tree down. I also rolled to see if the upcountry keepers were there.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And that was the one that they would have been there. Also, that was entirely possible, a truck would have come before you would all move the tree out of the way. So, Val, the fact that you took care of that was actually very good because you would have had to make a DC20 strength check to stop the truck like you were Spiderman.
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: Oh, my gosh.
Julia: Very cool. I'm glad that Val got their moment because I think they felt a little useless sitting in the backseat just kind of waiting for Aggie to drive and Milo to do his cool magic stuff. And they were just like, “Alright. Well, if we had taken the tank, we would have had a gun that I could have mounted and whatever, you know.”
Eric: Let's see. The bear threat, so, that was number four. And figuring out what if there was a bear. Black ice, that would have just been, like, straight up, Aggie, you needed to stop from driving off the road. And then the first thing that you did immediately that was so funny was that immediately Dr. Morrow skis by you, which was my favorite thing.
Amanda: Would you have let me use my monk slow fall to help with the – with the black ice situation?
Eric: How would that have – look, you would have slowly – it's like you had slow motion in the car --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- but everybody else --
Amanda: Like, I'd slow motion and, because I was touching the car, it also has slow motion because that's how slow-motion works, right? Right? Right?
Julia: We've all seen The Matrix. We know how slow-motion works.
Eric: I'm not really used to you trying shenanigans. So --
Amanda: And just really – I have that, like, little [Inaudible 10:32] Emily expert energy.
Eric: No, that wouldn't have helped. But, if you’d use a key point, I would let you --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- move in slow motion and maybe you could have saved the car.
Amanda: Cool.
Eric: Honestly, I'm getting more and more excited about event tables. I feel like I'm adapting to the fact that, like, I've laid all of these out and I have no problem with playing out the scenario. It feels like very crunchy rules has written Dungeons and Dragons. Like, straight-up stuff from Wizards of the Coast. Boo, boo. Wizards of the Coast, boo.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: But, honestly, I'm kind of like a – I like that it's a real thing that I wrote. And I'm kind of taking it out of my own hands, which makes me happy.
Julia: Hell yeah. This is more of a question for the players. Was everyone else, like in character, very frustrated with Dr. Morrow in these two episodes?
Amanda: Oh, yeah, 1000 percent.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: Val was just like, “Please be honest with us for like two seconds and just tell us what's going on. Like, I understand you have places to be because you're mysterious and shit, but, like, we need to know what's happening.”
Amanda: Yeah. And, like, this is normal for your life, Dr. Morrow, but you, you realize that the rest of us are not you. And maybe, after so long of just being insulated and having, like, unlimited resources, you know, and just like living her own life, it feels like, “Well, of course, you don't understand. Like, I'm fine with this bear.” But we're all just like, “You're not fine.”
Brandon: I think Milo – based on all the biographies of Dr. Morrow, he's like, “Oh, my god, it’s happening in real life.” Yeah, [Inaudible 11:59].
Eric: Just like in the graphic novels, she's so cool under pressure.
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: Alright. Well, here are a few questions from our audience on these episodes as well. So, Plotbunnies on Insta would just like to say, “How dare you, Eric?”
Eric: Oh, I made it. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda: JayPaul90 on Twitter would like to ask where you got the stat block for the Velociraptor. Did you make yourself, re-skin something? Is it someone else's homebrew? Or is it just like a thing in D&D?
Eric: Oh, that's a good question. Yeah, the velociraptor is in Volo’s Guide to Monsters. However, here's a surprise for you. I actually didn't come up with any sort of mechanics for that fight. I just kind of let you guys do whatever the fuck you want because I'm like, “I'm gonna shut this down and around. So, it doesn't really matter.”
Julia: I also realized, after we recorded and after listening to that episode, that, in the moment, I was very worried about Quinn following Val into the fight. But then I realized that all of those raptors took their reactions to make attacks of opportunity on me. So, they wouldn't have been able to take opportunity attacks on Quinn. So, I realized that later, but not in the moment.
Brandon: Oooh.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: I didn't think about that either.
Amanda: We can do little diversion into Quinn corner here. Bray on Discord asks if Quinn has a specified class.
Eric: Oh, that's a good question. Not really. Right now, I just have, like, her powers. And then I have a vague idea for HP and what her stats are. If I wrote it out, I bet I could just, like, have it there. But, right now, it's kind of just, like, ambiently in my head, because NPCs don't do the same thing as PCs do, you know. And PCs need this because US players are playing a game, but, like, NPCs are just like living their lives. So, it's like Quinn just has climb powers, and she's very nimble, and she has like high decks. But she's pretty low on, like, everything else.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Or pretty like plus zero to everything else. So, I don’t --
Brandon: It’s probably pretty plus, you know, eight on charisma too, though,
Julia: Only for Milo, though.
Eric: No, that’s just – no, that’s just to you, Brandon.
Amanda: Milo’s a personal plus 10 to all, all Quinn rolls.
Julia: Hmm.
Eric: Yes, that's right. She also does have high charisma. But, again, it's more like what happens in the – in the moment. And, since I'm kind of controlling everything, I don't have to, like, roll for her necessarily. But, like, if she got hurt, I have a vague idea of how many – how much HP she has as compared to the PCs and other things that are around.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Like, I just don't anticipate anyone punching Quinn, but we'll see.
Amanda: Bonnie and Eddie on Insta wants to know if Quinn could ever become a permanent member of the team. And Mila wants to know, if so, what would her superhero name be?
[Julia chuckles]
Brandon: Sticky hands.
Eric: I was literally just gonna say sticky hands. Yeah.
Amanda: Oh, no, dust got caught in it.
[Brandon and Julia laughs]
Julia: Now, it's useless. Throw it away. Buy another one at the grocery store for 50 cents.
Amanda: My favorite thing is when – when my joke takes a, a couple seconds to, to land on Brandon and I can watch on Zoom as it – as it hits and it makes me really, really happy.
Eric: Listen, Quinn needs to stay in Laketown City. Before that even happens, she has to train, but, right now, that she's being a, a fun actress and having famous friends. So, who even knows?
Julia: Yeah, she’s got a real life. It's nice that she's visiting, but she's got a real life.
Amanda: Lots of people want to know about Milo and Quinn shipping. I, I --
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Listen, in reality, as, as Amanda, the co-host of this podcast, I think it's very funny, and I'm down for it. But, in character, Aggie was just so immediately like, “Fucking no. I don’t want to cross the streams. It's – it’s bad enough for my sister to be here. I don't need my new coworker hitting on her.”
Brandon: To be fair, I don't think Milo knows how to hit on anyone. So, as it’s probably just, like --
Julia: We could tell.
Brandon: -- mumbling --
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: -- in her direction.
Amanda: Yeah, you, regarding [Inaudible 15:34 - Evelyn Zach Rose], makes me think, “Yes, that is true.”
Eric: I will say a really fun thing for me to do was telling Milo to fly. It’s, like, it’s so much fun because all I have to do is just lean super hard into the chaotic thing I want and then it will probably happen, which is something that definitely happens for Quinn.
Amanda: I love that.
Brandon: Eric, the fun thing about that is you spend so much time of your life in this Dungeons and Dragons game trying to make me not chaotic, like, as a player. And then we have a chaotic off. Like, “Alright, if we're gonna go down this road, you're gonna lose.”
Eric: And then Val just slams the door.
Julia: Nope, not happening.
Eric: Not even that, I – it’s just like [sigh] I think Brandon's characters do the thing that – yes, it just the most chaotic thing. But I think that all of them have a very – sort of preservation. Like, you need to be the one to make the chaos.
Brandon: Sure.
Eric: And I think you're doing it to me. So, when someone is doing it to you and peer pressuring your character, like, all of your characters pretty much do what they're – also, like, have a pretty, like, weak backbone in terms of that. With Tracey, you’re just like, “Fine.” And the man stuck out of time. Also, it’s just like, “Nothing matters. It's fine.” So, I think Milo also just like, “Yeah, I want friends. I'll do it. That's fine.”
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Gives in to peer pressure. That's the, the Milo guarantee.
Brandon: Absolutely.
Eric: So, yeah, listen, like, I’ll – yeah, I thought it was fun. I – listen, it was messing my own thing up. So, I'm like, I'll – if I'm doing it to myself, that's fine.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: Nola Braseen on Insta wants to know where Lucas gets all his snacks from.
Eric: This is – I wanted to give this to Brandon. Like, do you have – is there a secret place in MMFFC that you all stash all of your snacks?
Brandon: I mean, yeah, as in any office place where you have some sort of snacks, like, you need to hide them from your ravenous coworkers --
Amanda: Yep. Yep.
Brandon: -- who are jerks and will steal them.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Brandon: So, within the museum, I like to think that occasionally Milo's doing a tour. So, he gets to, like, a giant diorama of, like, an electron, and, like, what it looks like, and why it's so important to Dr. Morrow. And, like, hidden behind it is all of their snack stash. And, so, occasionally --
Amanda: What’s in the nucleus? Candy. Full-size candy.
Brandon: And, occasionally, if a kid is short enough, they can see it. And, so, they'll be like, “Why are there Snickers behind the electron?” And then Milo has to just move the group along really quickly.
Julia: Asher the child away.
Eric: The only thing in electron is energy, which helps this atom stay together.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: Michelle Spurgeon asks on Insta, “Does Milo not feel cold because of his connection to the dead?”
Brandon: Yeah, I think so. We're – we’re just sort of, like, dipping our toe in the water with that. I think there'll be some more sort of, like, developments on how the ghost and, like, the soul life affects the, the physical form that is Milo. But, yeah, there's no real inferences to draw from that except for, yeah, it's not – it’s not a big deal when he goes outside in the winter with a t-shirt on.
Eric: Except when he takes like cold damage.
Julia: Yeah, he doesn't feel it, but he does take the damage.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: That’s the important part.
Brandon: I mean that's an – that's an Eric Silver trademark. So, you know –
[Eric and Julia laugh]
Eric: I didn't think that this was – this was like a combination of the – of the ghost stuff and also, like, those skinny, white boys, you know, who are outside in January in shorts.
Brandon: Yeah, totally.
Julia: Except, we have established Milo’s never worn shorts in his life.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Only jeans
Eric: But if he was in a different reality. Like, if someone like John O'Donnell, who I knew in sixth grade who only wore shorts even when it was snowing, then you might be like that.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah, absolutely.
Eric: I know. It's okay John O’Donnell doesn't know what podcasts are.
Julia: Good. Good, good, good.
Amanda: Michelle also asks, “What other Go Go Gadget stuff does Dr. Mayor Morrow have on her person?
Eric: First of all, thank you for acknowledging my titles.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Constantly petitioning different, like, charitable boards to add that as his honorific.
Eric: You have to include multiple, multiple [Inaudible 19:50].
Julia: Needs to be five there. Or, else, what's the point?
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: You know, here's another thing, I didn't necessarily know how Episode 15 was going to resolve. I just knew that there was going to be a bear there and everyone's gonna throw themselves at them. And then Dr. Morrow was gonna do something. So, while we were doing this, I'm just like, “You know what would really be funny? It’s if Dr. Morrow had rocket boots on that she could just leave because she is --
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Amanda: How dare you?
Eric: -- she knows that she is always vaguely in danger. So --
[Brandon laugh]
Eric: So, she could just do this on our own time. Honestly, a lot of this stuff happens while we play together. I don't know. It’s – I don't know. Probably a bunch of stuff, probably a, a grappling hook, probably like a taser just in case. There might be, like, a hot cocoa machine in there. Like, very Jetsons. You use the button.
Julia: I feel like a net gun maybe.
Eric: Yeah, she, she clicks her heels, and a net pops out of her skis.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: I was thinking I feel like she would definitely have, like, really primo snacks. Just like scatter and run if there's like a bunch of kids running at her or something.
Julia: Just throws candy out.
Eric: I have – I still have Code Red. Does anyone want Mountain Dew Code Red? She throws it and skis away.
Julia: Okay, but consider piñata pantsuit.
Amanda: Hmm.
Eric: Go on.
Julia: It’s just like --
[Everyone laugh]
Julia: You know how there's, like, the life vest and you pull a thing and it puffs out?
Amanda: Oooh.
Julia: It's like that, except when there's a bunch of children around and she wants to escape, she pulls the tab and it just explodes and there's candy everywhere. Piñata pantsuit. TMTM.
Eric: I do like the idea – when you first said it's a – it's a pinata. It's a facsimile of Dr. Morrow. So, she can, like, leave it in places.
[Amanda and Brandon laugh]
Julia: Like a decoy. Hmm. Interesting.
Eric: But it's also filled with candy all the time.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: But it is just also a decoy if she needs to escape.
Julia: Gotcha. Cool. Cool. Cool.
Amanda: Michelle, again, coming through with great questions. Are the upcountry keepers just a publicity stunt for Emily? Or are they actually interested in helping? I'll say, from my perspective --
Brandon: Yeah, Eric.
Amanda: -- they probably are interested in helping in theory. But, for us, they're so fucking annoying.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: That, that they are mostly interested in publicity. Like, I, I see how their intentions are good, but also, like, no.
Brandon: I don't know. I don't see how it – I don't – I mean I don't think their intentions are bad, but I don't think they have intentions to help per se.
Julia: Is it like performative superheroic? Is that what we're kind of like --
Amanda: Mhmm.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: -- dubbing it? Yeah.
Amanda: It feels that way. Yeah.
Julia: Interesting.
Eric: Yeah, I think it – it’s from – if we were looking at this objectively and I was writing like a BuzzFeed list or an average bear list as it were --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- about nine reasons why the upcountry keepers are actually good. You know, that they were doing it, but Emily Slaughter – I guess I have – she's such a busybody to me. Like, she's a – if you met Leslie Knope in real life, I feel like that's what she would be like.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Like, she's not – like, if that was someone you had to interact with on a regular basis who worked with you, you'd be like, “Man, fuckin’ bums me out.”
Julia: This person.
[Brandon laugh]
Eric: Just please stop. Just please stop. And someone like me with the cynicism that you need in 2020 or 2020X as we're living in, in Laketown City. They're definitely doing stuff. I just think that she also knows that it has to be public-facing and as the other superhero team feels like that you are doing good stuff and not saying anything about it. I could see why you're taking that on the chin.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: I mean lots of people think that she's – she's doing a great job and Sour Anthony's great and so is Taxonomy and all those guys.
Brandon: No one thinks that Sour Anthony is great, Eric.
Sour Anthony: Hey, man.
Brandon: Not a single --
Sour Anthony: Hey, man, I talk to KB toys and they're making, like, a stuffed animal of me.
Julia: Oh, no.
Sour Anthony: Hey, fuck you, man. You’re just jealous.
Amanda: Alright. We got to end this with a question that I can talk about. Deep2121 on Insta asked, “With the media closing in on the O'Hare's, how does Aggie feel about the most public ones being near?” Bad. Bad.
Julia: Bad.
Amanda: I think she – again, like she's kind of torn, you know, between these two impulses of, like, integrating her life a little bit better and, and being kind of open with her loved ones or being not just the fixer in front of her family. But, also, it’s dangerous. They are impulsive. And it's, like, if she had to choose for some siblings to be around, why not, like, the quiet married one or the one – the Guggenheim Fellowship who is not gonna fucking do anything to destroy his own career. So, I, I love that Eric has the, the most sort of plot worthy ones around. But Stephanie Kay on Insta asked if we wish we did anything different with our characters. And that was the only thing that came to mind for me. It’s like, selfishly, I wished that I started Aggie’s opening scene, you know, like, on a video chat with her family so that I could know what all their powers are because I really want to know and I don't know.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: So, that is the only thing that I have to say bad about my builds for Aggie.
Brandon: I would really love to see Eric do a – like, like, buttoned-up sort of, like, conservative MPC.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: You know what I mean? Because I don't think I've seen you really, like, go full into that. Yeah.
Julia: Like, corporate.
Brandon: Or like – yeah, like, mild – like, mild-mannered. Like, married. You know, married, with children, normal kind of – kind of person.
Amanda: Milo’s dad struck me as a little bit like that. I mean he's also like a little bit --
Julia: But he’s like big dad energy.
Amanda: Big dad energy. Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: But just a little bit different.
Brandon: But he's still a little quirky, you know?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I guess they all are a little quirky just because I think that that's a lot more interesting.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: Oh, I do too. Yeah, don't get me wrong.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yeah, I'm trying to think from Campaign 1. I think that there were a lot of people – like the speaker --
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: -- was always – was incredibly buttoned up. Yeah.
Brandon: That's true.
Eric: And your, your ridiculousness really pulled it out of her.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: And, as, as the world was kind of falling apart on the speaker, I was really trying to lay down the law on that. I'm also trying to think of people from, like, the bachelorette tournament as well. Like, a lot of those people were a lot more normal. And they were just, like, on a reality show. It’s definitely something.
Brandon: That’s true.
Amanda: So, not Kevin Vacation, you're saying.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: There was nothing wrong with Kevin Vacation.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: He just had wings. And his last name was Vacation.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: So chill.
Eric: But, yeah, I don't know. I feel like the people who you all interact with just aren't normal. They all have really important jobs or, at least, think it's important --
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: -- in that way. So, like, I don't know. It's, like, the people who are incredibly buttoned up and not even snooty, like, they're at home, you know.
Julia: Yeah. Yeah.
Brandon: That’s true. That's true. It's a good point.
Julia: I think, like, Mr. Brewpot is fairly normal. He's just like a boss.
Amanda: Also, big dad energy.
Brandon: Yeah, that’s true.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Hitomi seems quite – quite level headed.
Julia: She's cool though.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: She’s cool.
Eric: Hitomi is very cool. Yes, that’s a thing.
Amanda: She’s too cool. Yeah, that’s true.
Eric: Yeah. I don't know if there's anyone who just has, like, zeros as their modifiers for anything. I think Mr. Brewpot is close. But, again, they have to dad energy.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And, yeah, I think that that – that’s just – that’s kind of just where I end up pulling from. It's – it’s hard --
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: -- because – especially because I, I don't go voice to who they are. I go the opposite way. So, I think that I have to give them strong adjectives to go for, but buttoned-up is one --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- to your point, Brandon.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Like I said, not, not that it’s bad. I just – I don't know if I found a place for them to put together.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: But they're – but they're around. I mean the council – some of the council people also are a little bit buttoned up. If not, they – they're – they're just terrible.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, I think, Eric, to return to the, the question about if we wanted to change anything about our characters, I do wish that I had a more distinctive voice for Aggie because, every time we sit down to play, I'm just like, “Umm. I wished I made her voice a little bit lower.” And Julia’s very good accent of the town in which we grew up just like gets into my brain. And it's very hard for me not to use what Julia [Inaudible 27:26].
Julia: Yeah.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: So, that's my, my only, only complaint really. Julia, how about you? How about Val?
Julia: I don't think so. I think Val was – [sigh] I don't want to say that they were, like, fully formed with the idea, but it was easy to iterate off of my original concept. And I don't think there's anything that I would particularly change about them because I love them as is. And I know how I would respond to most situations now as well.
Amanda: Yeah, me neither.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Yeah, I thought – yeah, I'm sort of on the same page with you, Julia. I don't think I would change much about Milo. I think he is pretty, like, average, but that's sort of like the choice that was intentional --
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: -- to make him pretty average, you know. But yeah.
Julia: He's a dorky lad and I love him. So --
Brandon: He’s a dorky lad.
Amanda: Alright. If, if we were all at a party and you, like, reached into the chip bowl and your hand hit the bottom of the bowl and realize there’s no more chips there, what would each of you do? What would your characters do?
Julia: Val would track down another bag of chips and probably pour half of them in there.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Julia: And then carry what's left of the bag around with themselves.
Amanda: Very good. Very good. Milo.
Brandon: I think Milo would sort of like go around the party and, like, casually be like, “Oh, yeah, You can see there’s no chips left.”
[Amanda and Eric laugh]
Julia: Oh, man, we’re out of chips.
Brandon: To like everyone --
Eric: That’s not what – that’s not what he’d do.
Brandon: To like everyone he saw just to see what happens until someone else did it.
Amanda: I, I think Aggie would already be in the kitchen refilling it because the chips should not get below one third. So, on that note, I'm going to be right back.
Midroll Music
Amanda: Hey, it's Amanda. And, for the first time ever, we have a guest anecdote for you titled Sleepy Kitty. Alright. Here's what it says. My cat is very vocal. He loves meow and, sometimes, I have a little conversations with him. So, when it's time for me to go to bed, he follows me right into my bedroom and tries to keep me from leaving him and going into the void between reality and the dreamscape. So, I've been looking for every possible way to keep him quiet while I'm trying to get my well – beauty rest. And it just so happens that I tried listening to Join the Party one night and, let me tell you, he went straight to sleep. I thought maybe it was just that there was a sound for him to drift off to. So, I also tried calming music. But, no, it was only your fantastic D&D podcast. He now waits patiently right beside my pillow for me to play that sweet, sweet audio magic so he can fall asleep.

But, regardless of whether or not you can support us on Patreon, or buy merch, or support us financially, it's incredibly helpful when you recommend the show to your friends. Finding new audiences in podcasting is really hard. The most effective way to connect with people who might really love the show is just for someone who knows them really well to suggest it. It's like giving someone the perfect present, you know, but no one had to spend money or deal with packages. So, we set up a special landing page to help new audiences get to know the show, including links to the beginner episodes, where we teach people how to play D&D. So, listen, text or email someone you care about the link to jointhepartypod.com/start today and tell them why they’d love the show. It's a huge help. We are sponsored by BetterHelp, a secure online counseling service. They connect you with licensed counselors through their secure app, letting you message with your therapist, and schedule live phone or video sessions. You can also message your counselor in between sessions if you're worrying about something or think of a topic you want to cover in your next call. I do this with my therapist to be at BetterHelp. And, because they want you to find the best therapeutic match possible, they make it easy and free to switch counselors if need be. I cannot emphasize enough how much that is not a thing in traditional offline counseling. It's also more affordable than traditional counseling with financial aid also available.

One size doesn't fit all for almost anything, including shampoo, which is why Function of Beauty has over 54 trillion ingredient combinations to make a formula that is just for you. All you have to do is take a short quiz, which is very beautifully designed and very fun to see what custom formula their team comes up with. And then they deliver your formula right to your door. My favorite thing is that you can choose the color of your product, which is amazing, but also the scent and the strength of that scent. I sneeze whenever I smell perfume or scented candles. So, it's so nice to, for once, get a scented product that is very mildly smelling of citrus or Eucalyptus and it does not make me sneeze. Have you ever sneezed in the shower? It's terrible.

I recently really enjoyed their toasted coconut tempura shrimp, which is one of those meals I might feel intimidated to try on my own. But it was really easy to follow along with their recipe card, which also has photos. It's very helpful. They've also donated over 3.5 million meals so far in 2020. And they offer customers a chance to buy meals for people in need during the checkout process, which I think is great.

Amanda: Alright. We're back. All the chip bowls are topped off. Nobody needs to worry.
Eric: Oh, hey, did you guys notice there are chips now? They’re so great.
Julia: Oh, hell yeah.
Eric: [Inaudible 34:43].
Julia: Is there dip?
Amanda: Let’s --
Eric: Oh, man. If only there was dip. I really wished there was.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: I wished someone would get us some dip. That would be really cool.
Amanda: Aggie puts down her drink, makes deliberate eye contact, and turns back into the kitchen.
Julia: I liked the moment in the episode where Quinn turned to us and was like, “Is she always like this with you guys?” And I was like, “Yes, but that's a good thing.”
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Thank you. Let's get into some more kind of fun, like, general and character questions. AskBergman on Insta says, “How was Eric's first game of D&D that you did DM? How the hell did you sort your notes? I’m writing my first campaign and I haven't been a DM before. Love the show on Multitude, but I'd love some help.”
Eric: Oh, man, I'm trying to think. I think that this was the first one that I played with Amanda, Julia, Eric Schneider, and Jake.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: That’s right. I wrote down a lot of stuff. I definitely wrote down all of the places that I thought you might go, people who were there. There's, like, a really big list. I think it was really helpful. Like, writing down all the places that you think they would go, all the rooms, and then writing down all of the NPCs that – like, really naming them in advance and giving them adjectives, and characters, and jobs. But then, the one I did later, which I think about is that, immediately, someone Jake or Schneider canceled.
Julia: It was Jake. Jake wasn't there in that episode.
Eric: Oh, it was Jake.
Julia: You had him fuck the cheese witch.
Eric: That's right. He was fucking – he was fucking the cheese witch [Inaudible 36:13].
Brandon: Jesus Christ.
Eric: Yeah, I was like – this was at my Session 4 and I had to throw something together that was non-canonical in, like, half an hour. And then it just kind of happened and it was really fun. And it was, like, an adventure – an adventuring consultants wanted to hire them and have them do, like, some word associations but they conjured a demigod. It was really fun. So, kind of just, like, giving yourself a through-line about what you want to do. The way that I think of DMing is like you're playing a game of Euchre, or spades, or anything where you have a hand that you have to play even like Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh, where it's like you have your hand and that is your prep. Those are your notes. But you can play it in any order that you want according to what they do. You can move NPCs from one place to another. So, for example, a really good example from Campaign 1 was when everyone into the giant mistake and, and Tracey went into the back kitchen immediately. What I did have, I wrote down that there were illegal Snail Races happening, but I did not know that this was gonna happen. I thought that you had to look at some shady shit and, like, see if you wanted to make some money or not. But I had that. And I'm like, “Alright. Well, oh, Tracy wants to be Batman. And I guess Batman is breaking up in a legal snail racing ring.” But that's going to be happening there. So, you just kind of move it around. And, if someone does interact with an NPC, it's fine because you just use it that episode or not. So, what I would say is have your prep. Don't spend – I've seen that, like, you want to cap yourself at half of the amount of time prepping that you would spend playing. So, like, if you're going to play for three hours, do not prep for more than an hour and a half. And just, like, write down as much stuff as you think you need, write down a lot of extra names, and write down things that you want them to interact with because they're fun and funny. But, anything else, just, like, let it flow and I think that you're okay. I use – I use Google Docs. And I use Notion because I just like making lists and tables.
Julia: I will also say that the last-minute prep session was the infamous session where you made me cry just for people’s --
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: I didn't want to include it this time. I feel like I say it every time.
Amanda: Every time.
Eric: But, yes, the, the reason why when I felt, like, I was doing a good job and that you don't need to over-prepare is that I made Julia cry because it’s just like pulling stuff in from her character's backstory and things that I thought would be fun. And we also didn't know what the demigod was going to be until I pulled things from the literal actual character, which was really fun. So, if you want to DM, you have storytelling abilities. So, like, you have that and, you know, you're – you’re playing it out. I think the less – the less notes, the better because it forces you to think on your feet.
Julia: Hell yeah.
Amanda: I do really like Notion for organizing. I switched from Evernote to notion at the end of last year because Evernote sold personal data to the government.
Eric: Ba, ba, bop.
Amanda: And it's – it's really – it's like very modular. So, it's cool if you want to, like, make a list. But then it ends up being part of a larger project and it has, like, Emoji support and the titles, which is very important to me. So, recommended it.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: I do like the emoji support. I have a different Notion document for each arc. And the first arc was a bank and the second one was a snowman.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: What about this one, Eric?
Eric: I can't tell you.
Amanda: Nooo!
Eric: Well, it's gonna be – it's gonna be spring next season.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: So, it’s a flower.
Julia: Nice.
Eric: It’s a flower emoji.
Amanda: Ooh. Writing down my notes. Okay.
Eric: Spoilers. It’s gonna be spring next.
Amanda: Bray asks, “What is each of our character’s favorite wintery drink? Coffee, hot chocolate, eggnog, et cetera.
Julia: Wooh.
Amanda: I think Aggie really likes hot apple cider. And it's, you know, local cider, malt on the stove or bust.
Brandon: Gosh, that's so good.
Eric: I bet Aggie has, like, all of the big spices. Like, the full spices. Like, an actual piece of star anise and, like, an actual nutmeg nut. Did you know nutmeg is a nut? It's just a nut.
Julia: I’ve never ever heard of that before.
Brandon: What?
Amanda: It's just a nut. Yeah, I think Aggie has, like, my dream pantry. And, if any of our very talented audience members who would like to draw Aggie and her dream pantry just want to, like, let me know, I would love that.
Brandon: Just sort of like Ariel in her cave of wonders or whatever.
Amanda: Yeah, like, in front of just, like, you know, beautiful, like, dark wood shelving with glass jars of, like, whole spices and, you know, grains and all that good shit. Oh, my god. I'm getting a little bit, like, sweaty palms right now. That was so great.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Thingamabobs? Yeah, I got them. Just give me a second.
Amanda: So good.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: It’ll be somewhere around here.
Eric: What do you call them?
Amanda: Star anise?
Eric: Nuts – quarter nuts? Quarter bolts? Quarter nuts bolts?
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: Oh, yes. No, half of it is, is food and the other half is hardware organized the exact same way.
Eric: And that's when you walk into Pier One and say, “I want more.”0
[Amanda and Julia laugh]
Eric: These were all mermaid – Little Mermaid references. Give me my flowers.
Julia: Incredible.
Brandon: Is Pier One still around? Did they go bank --
Julia: No, they're going bankrupt.
Brandon: Oh, that sucks.
Amanda: Well, that’s sales.
Eric: There’s a Pier One in my – in my alternate universe, there’s still a Pier One. Sorry. I meant House – House Warehouse, my fault.
Julia: Yeah. You know what disappointed me? The sales, even with their going out of business sales, were not very good. Still too expensive.
Brandon: It seems like we've solved the mystery of why they're going out of business.
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: I really have a lot of headcanon about Aggie’s house and kitchen. I think all of her appliances are, like, from the 60s and 70s and they're just like workhorses. It’s just like they don't make them like this anymore.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yesterday, my grandma texted me like, “Oh, my mother's juicer” – my grandma's 81. Her mom's juicer from her childhood --
Brandon: Oh, my god.
Amanda: -- she still had. And then she's like, “My mom's toughest iron juicer mint condition and Connor doesn't want it. How about you?”
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Amanda: And I was like, “Hell yes, I do, grandma. Hell yes, I do.” And I think Aggie – all of her appliances are, like, from the 40s through 70s. And she just, like, maintains them lovingly as if they are vintage car.
Julia: Incredible.
Amanda: Anyway, favorite drinks.
Brandon: That was a question. Yeah.
Julia: I think Val likes a – like the, the kind of decaf coffee that you have after a meal.
Amanda: Hmm.
Eric: Mhmm.
Julia: But spiked with Frangelico.
Brandon: Now, what is Frangelico?
Amanda: Nice.
Julia: It is a --
Eric: Is that one of Val’s plans?
Julia: -- Italian liqueur that's, like, hazel flavored.
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon: Ooh.
Amanda: Very cool, Eric.
Eric: That's actually one of Salamone’s cousins.
Julia: [Inaudible 42:16].
[Brandon laughs]
Salamone: Hey, you better pay me or me and my good friend, Frangelico, are gonna come over and turn over your shit.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: You want to know something really funny? It's a brown bottle that’s shaped like a monk.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Oh, my god.
Eric: Yep.
Amanda: And then – and, you know, Chino will be right over.
Eric: I got my two friends, Fran and Gelico right here for me.
Amanda: One crazy night.
Brandon: Jesus Christ. I think Milo just likes super sugary coffee drinks. Like, he's super into hot peppermint mocha. And --
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric: Mhmm.
Brandon: -- What is the other Christmas drink? Peppermint mocha and --
Amanda: I think they’re like a butterscotch something, right?
Brandon: Something like that.
Amanda: Praline.
Julia: They usually do like a salted caramel for winter and stuff like that.
Brandon: Yeah. He love – he loves a good salted caramel. Yeah.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Does Milo have a Starbucks name even though his name does not need a Starbucks name?
Brandon: Yes, it – well, he thinks, because he has powers, that he needs to always hide his name --
Amanda: Hmm.
[Julia laughs]
Brandon: -- even though it doesn't matter at all.
Amanda: Very good.
Brandon: And, so, he changed it up each time also. So, right now, he goes by, like, Rex, you know.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: It’s great.
Amanda: I love it.
Eric: You used Lucas for a long time until Lucas called you on it.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: I was gonna say Lucas and Skywalker. And then Lucas was like, “I'm ordering with you. This doesn't help.”
Eric: Luke – Lucas. You can do Filo. I mean that's – that's your name, right?
Julia: Miles
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Filo. Filo dough, is that – that’s one of your names?
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: I know that this was on everybody's tongue – at the tip of their tongue and I just need to tell you. January goes hard into hot cocoa.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And – but it's like sourcing the best cocoa. There was a place – this just shut down in New York City. What was the name? City Bakery used to have in --
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: They would have the most incredible sugary hot chocolate. I'm talking about like – the hot chocolate was very bitter. But then the, the marshmallow was like the size of a one inch by one-inch cube.
Julia: Incredible.
Eric: It was mass – it was massive. And they would have different flavors all throughout February. It was like February was a hot chocolate month. And it was just – it was so incredible. So, I feel like January is really into that stuff and hops down to New York City to get that.
Julia: Nice. Hops down.
Brandon: I feel like January will take --
Eric: Thank you.
Brandon: -- the, the private helicopter down to, like – Where is cocoa grown? Nicaragua? I don’t know.
Julia: Interesting. Alright.
Brandon: Costa Rica. Costa Rica. And just like picks the, the beans himself.
Amanda: In his little paws.
Eric: That's adorable.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Julia: And then has to roast and process it himself?
Eric: 100 percent.
Amanda: Well, Julia Catherine on Insta wanted to know, other than drink cocoa, what does January get up to when they're home alone?
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Is it just like cocoa and cocoa-related hobbies? Yeah.
Eric: Yeah, roasting the cocoa, grinding the cocoa, making sure it's delicious.
Julia: I can picture as a January's a knitter.
Eric: Yeah, for sure. I think January is just, like, when you – your grandpa says he's puttering around.
[Everybody laugh]
Eric: Whatever he's doing, that's what January is doing.
Amanda: Julia, extraordinary transition here, Bray on discord wants to know, “Does Val's mom knit? And, if so, how many lewd scarves and hats does Val have from their mom?
Brandon: Oh, my God, so many dick scarves.
Julia: I don't think that she does knit. I think that is like – I picture her very much like a – like feminist rebel in that she grew up with very strict gender norms that she kind of, like, goes as far away from them as possible. She's very, like, much, like, a woman of the 70s and 80s.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: So, I don't think she knits. I think she does, like – again, she does pottery and stuff like that. So, she has, like, her own kiln and makes a lot of, like – if she's giving gifts for the holidays, it's usually a mug or something to that effect.
Amanda: Lots of boob planters. A lot of those are big on Etsy.
Julia: Boob planters.
Eric: I also think that, like, she's never done a dick because she says – like, she's never made an artistic penis.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Because she's like, “There's enough of that in the real world.”
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: That’s true.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: Why would I need to make that?
Brandon: She's not wrong.
Amanda: She’s not wrong. Otto would like to know what is HPC and a couple of NPC’s favorite Stuart's flavor. If you don't know this regional gas station ice cream chain, go with just general flavor.
Eric: For ice cream.
Amanda: For ice cream.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yeah, I think Aggie really likes the mint chip.
Julia: Huh. I'm a mint chip person myself. I have to think about what Val likes. Give me a second.
Eric: Can I – can I do one – do you want just a lot off that?
Julia: Sure.
Eric: Alright. I would say that Val likes anything – like, anything that has alcohol in it like a rum. Even rum raisin or like an Amaretto, any of that. Just like the fact that you're eating something sweet that also has the alcoholic bite.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: That feels very Val, especially from the, the drinks. Milo really loves, like, mango sorbet. And you compare mango sorbet all over the city.
[Amanda and Brandon laugh]
Brandon: Mango sorbet is delicious. So --
Eric: I – it’s not – it's not a dig. It's the truth. It's the truth.
Brandon: I was gonna say Milo might – I think you're right, but I think he also – he vacillates between, like, a mango sorbet, which is much lighter, and then, on his heavy days, he goes for like a – like a rocky road or something --
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: -- where it has just, like, tons of mini marshmallows in it, you know.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: Yeah, I was gonna say I think Val is the kind of person that really likes a lot of, like, crunch going on in their ice cream. So, like, throw some peanuts or some chocolate chips or something like that. And there's something that gives it like texture besides the ice cream texture.
Amanda: Nice.
Brandon: Hmm.
Eric: I was gonna say that Aggie really likes strawberry. And then takes it home and doctors it up herself.
Julia: Hmm. Cute.
Amanda: Hmm. I like that. Folly and some berries. Oh, yeah.
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: Kazaya Wilkins asks what our favorite NPCs are. So, players, what are our favorite NPCs? Obviously, January, but beyond him.
Julia: Hmm. Oh, this is like picking your favorite children. Unacceptable.
Eric: It’s fine.
Brandon: I mean Dez? Can we say Dez? Or --
Amanda: Dez.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: I mean there's just so many.
Brandon: I mean January is the correct answer, but --
Eric: I would like to challenge you all and do someone who's not, like, around all the time. Like, is there anyone who's – who is very – that was a flash in the pan who you’re just like, “I like that guy.”
Julia: I have loved every – and I haven't had a lot. I've only had the one interaction. But I have loved every Ant-man moment --
Amanda: Mhmm.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: -- that Val and Ant-man have had so far. Like, that was – like, they're just intense. And I like an intense RP moment. So, it's – it's a big thing for me. I really like Val's mom because I can just kind of sit back and watch the scene unfold in front of me. And it's like I'm watching a movie. It's just really wonderful.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Brandon: I mean, obviously, I'm a big fan of all the, the boys. I do like Apple’s just general aura.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: So big.
Amanda: Very true.
Eric: I think I like all the NPCs, like, the third time I do them. I think that that's where – that was something – when you said the question about anything you'd wish you could change about the PCs. Like, I wish I had a better handle on them when I started. But, you know, it just takes time to develop them. Like, I really like Dr. Morrow now. I didn't like Dr. Morrow nearly as much when I first started doing her. But, now that she's like this dark brown character who's really intense and needs to tell you how things go, it’s very – it’s a lot of fun to do.
Brandon: Yeah, I noticed them – I think it was in 15 when it was the moment where it was, like, something flipped and you're like, “Oh, this is who Dr. Morrow is.”
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: I, I think it was when – in the, the whiteboard meeting, when she said, “I did something with electrons.” And that's when I'm like, “Ah, that's who she is.”
Brandon: Oh, yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah, you said that in the episode of Clear Eyes, Full Hearts. You're like, “That is the moment where I was like, “This is Dr. Murrow's character.”
Amanda: Aww.
Eric: Man, you should really – everyone should be really listening to that because there's a lot of really interesting insight. And it's a really good game.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And Episode 2 is out now and there'll be a third episode. So, everyone should be patrons. So, it would just be a really good idea.
Julia: It also might be like that game has repercussions on the game that we're playing. Who's to say?
Amanda: Who’s to say?
Eric: Oh, that's true. That's true. That did happen.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: I could say there is a canonical moment in Clear Eyes. Like, I'm thinking it's canonical now. So, you – all three of you need to listen to it so you’ll understand what's happening.
Amanda: Well, I'm going to close with less of a question, more of a comment from Cathy Snob on Twitter. I don't like Sour Anthony. But, at the same time, I think he's underrated.
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: Food for thought.
Brandon: That's – that's a take. That is a take.
Amanda: I respect it. Oh – and we also had a couple questions about Slam.
Julia: Hmm.
Brandon: Slam.
Amanda: It feels like every day is a year. So, I completely forgot that this came up.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: We put out so much audio in the last 30 days really.
Julia: We really did.
Brandon: I know.
Eric: Now that we can actually talk about it, we did two regular episodes, one After Party then now this After Party, two episodes of Joined the Team. And I feel like there was something else in there and maybe I have to start writing.
Amanda: And Slam.
Brandon: Slam.
Eric: And then Slam. Yeah, exactly. So, we put out a lot of audio. That was the audio I was teasing.
Amanda: Mia Schloss asked, “Did Charles, the assistant, look like Chris Hemsworth in Ghostbusters?”
Julia: Now, that's all I can picture. Oh, my god.
Amanda: I dig it.
Brandon: That's really good.
Eric: He definitely had really similar energy. I thought that that was really funny. And I thought that Julius character --
Julia: Awesome.
Eric: -- needed a male assistant. Moxie needed a male assistant to kick around. And he was really important to me. He was – in my head, he looked like the assistant from the first season of Smash.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Do you remember that?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: The one about Broadway.
Julia: Yes, the Marilyn Monroe Musical.
Eric: Which is so terrible. Everyone needs to watch it.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Yeah, he was like Ellis. But, now, it's something like – he's like a little taller and a little more – he was just like super tall and super skinny in my head. But, now, it's probably just Chris Hemsworth wearing glasses.
Julia: I'm into it.
Amanda: That actor is Jaime Cepero, who is wonderful.
Brandon: It makes it even better thinking about Chris Hemsworth becoming Thor later. And he's just – in our camp – in our world, he just keeps getting kidnapped.
Julia: Yes, it's very cute.
Eric: It's now even funnier knowing that he lit on fire and then disappeared for a while.
[Eric and Brandon laugh]
Julia: I really liked the idea that it is, like, canonically as big as Chris Hemsworth is, but Moxie is bigger.
[Everyone laugh]
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: That is – that is incredibly funny. Yes, for sure.
Amanda: Also, I think he addressed this in the discord. But, for everybody else who's not yet a patron, is the talking Daisy based on the flower from Hello from the Magic Tavern?
Eric: Oh, my god, the talking Daisy. There's something really funny about a flower that swears at you and says shit like that.
[Everyone laugh]
Eric: So, no, it wasn't based off that. I just thought it was really funny. I, I – it was kind of like a reverse Audrey 2 from Little Shop of Horrors. Like, not a big plant but a really small plant. But I, I see that. I – now that I remember, it's very similar. I actually had a lot more inspiration from Flowey from Undertale. This, like, terrible, evil, conniving flower that ruins your whole life in Undertale. But, no, I just thought it was a really funny thing to have.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: What would have happened if we had fed the flowers enough blood?
Eric: Oh, it probably would have Audrey 2ed out.
Julia: Okay. Yeah.
Eric: Yeah. Or you could have, like, thrown it at the – it was really just supposed to help you out if it was – if you could just give it a little bit and it was just --
Amanda: Throw it.
Eric: Uh, huh. Oh, you fuck me. Oh, man, fuck that guy. I fucking hate the robot devil. Fuck that. Fucking asshole bitch. I fucking hate that guy.
Amanda: I would never throw my best friend.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: It’s just like his – more like his vengeance or something. But, yeah, if all of you gave him blood, I think it would have been a real Audrey 2 mode. Yeah.
Julia: Yeah, I'm still concerned that that's gonna be like the next villain after the, the robot devil.
Amanda: You gotta – you got to play fast and loose in side campaigns.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: I love it so much.
Eric: Listen, the robot devil, much like the Christian devil, can never die and will always haunt you.
Julia: Okay.
[Amanda and Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Oh, very good. I keep waking up sometimes. And the first thought in my brain is like, “Why didn't I block the fucking doors?” And it really just haunts me.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: Oh, man, I love Slam so much. It's – there's something about playing a comic book inside of a comic book. They, like, really restores some of the silliness of the first campaign of a fantasy campaign that I really like going back to, like, having a giant rolling pumpkin, having a robot devil, having a character die but not actually die. Like, all that silliness of like when, when Agent Smith looked up where the robot devil was and it was like a Luigi’s Mansion mansion. And it's just like, “The robot devil lives here.”
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: That was very funny. And I know I do stuff like that in the actual campaign, but really leading into it intentionally is the – why we like slam so much.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: And, Hero Forge, keep sponsoring us so we can keep doing it.
Amanda: Yeah. No, genuinely, podcast ads are like – you know, they're – they're complicated. Most of the time, it's just like, “Okay. There's an ad slot on an episode. So, like, I'll do a one-minute ad and, like, that's that. But Hero Forge, genuinely, is really great. They love working with creators. They love sponsoring weird shit. And, when we talked to our contact there and was like, “Hey, do you want to sponsor a side quest episode set in a comic book set in our universe?” They were like, “Sign me up, dude.”
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: So, we really appreciate it and, hopefully, we can bring you more.
Brandon: Yeah. And, if you want us to keep doing more, go tell Hero Forge that you liked it.
Julia: Yes, tell Hero Forge and let me play Moxie more so I can say ridiculous things like, “I subsidize your healthcare. I get your acupuncture.”
[Amanda and Brandon laugh]
Eric: Man, maybe we should put some more heroes in there and maybe I can take the NPCs from the different subclasses from No Capes. You should buy that as well.
Julia: Ooh.
Amanda: Ooh, No Capes, the guy linked to in the description of this episode? Ooh.
Eric: Oh, my goodness.
Julia: [Inaudible 55:49] me up.
Amanda: Let's move into the spoily the corner.
Eric: Oh, there were so many spoilies.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Oh, you all want to know what happens next so bad, don't you?
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: I am thinking I'm just going to read them in succession. Then, at the end, we can have a really extended one. Like a – like an elementary school graduation. Like, let's just save the class till the end. That should fill that up.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Okay.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: So specific.
Amanda: Yeah. Alright. Knight of Mirror’s corner, Stephanie Kay, is the bear connected to the Knight of Mirror somehow? When it's Knight of Mirror coming back? Not having them in the last few episodes is eyes emoji. Mia Schloss asks does the Knight of Mirror use a snowmobile instead of a motorcycle in winter. That's a very good one. Vicki Moo, “Why is Dr. Mayor Morrow cloning bears? Good question. Mel118, is the keypad combo for Dr. Morrow’s office 8005? Michelle Spurgeon --
Eric: Its boobs in Math.
Brandon: Oh.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yeah, all of the keypad – the default keypad code in Laketown City, all of it, is boobs.
Amanda: Not 11111.
Brandon: boobs.
Eric: Its boobs. It, it – actually, Dr. Morrow instituted that because she thought that boobs would make more people change it other than 12345.
Julia: That’s fair.
Eric: So, that's actually --
Julia: Smart thinking.
Eric: That was actually a big deal. Yeah.
Amanda: Michelle asks how has crime-fighting affected Aggie’s work as caretaker of the Historic District. Andy Noel, Yo, what's up it's Sour Anthony?
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: He's so sus. Immediately would call out.
Eric: For those of you Olds out there, sus is what people say in the popular game
Among Us where people are suspicious.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Vicki Moo, will we be seeing Teagan again? Sachdesh, was the bear a villain in disguise? Because regular black bears hibernate. Thank you.
Julia: Hmm.
Eric: Hey, you – hold on. I looked this up. Please, excuse me.
Brandon: Bears don’t hibernate.
Eric: I spent so much time looking up animals in Upstate New York.
Brandon: They don’t.
Eric: Guys, so, please be proud of me. Bears don't just sleep. Bears also go out and have to forage for food when they do get hungry. So, there would be a bear out if it was a real bear. I'm not saying it is or I'm not saying it isn't. But, according to the Alaska Fish and Wildlife News segment, Ask A Wildlife Biologist, do bears really sleep all winter? No, they don't.
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: They, they do not hibernate. They go into a torpor.
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: And they do forage for food.
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: Eric is 100 percent correct. I learned this, like, a month ago.
Eric: Did you also learn from the Alaskan Fish Wildlife News? Well, the --
Brandon: I did. Yeah. I'm subscribed to them.
Eric: For February 2008?
Brandon: Yeah.
[Amanda laughs]
Amanda: Alright. Just to close out, Kate asks does Lucas notice the switch between Kilonova and Milo at all? I’m surprised Eric didn't try to address the deception of it all. Can you believe this? Is this all taking place within the danger shed of fun and destiny? Michelle, is there still stuff in the water causing changes?? Big Bear and big mountain lobster. And then Desmond Ishmael, what is Dr. Morrow not telling us about these giant animals? She is way too calm about this entire bear situation.
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: Who can say?
Julia: Who can say?
Brandon: Who can say?
Eric: Who can?
Brandon: Who can say [Inaudible 58:58]?
[Julia laugh]
Eric: Who can say?
Amanda: Eric could say. He just isn't.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: These are just really good spoilies. I think they’re all interesting and they’re also smart. And thanks for listening.
[Julia and Eric laugh]
Eric: Keep listening. They will be unspoiled for you.
Amanda: Well, I know that working on Join the Party is my, my favorite part of the week in terms of being able to, like, sit down, think about a fictional universe where my actions have consequences. And it is really lovely. So, thanks, Eric, for preparing this world for us. Thanks, Julia and Brandon for being my compatriots. Thanks, everyone, for listening, genuinely. It's – it's way more fun to do podcasts when there are people who care about them. And you guys care so much.
Julia: Aww.
Brandon: Thank you.
Julia: That was very sweet.
Brandon: And Eric, specifically, thank you for allowing me the chance to try to roll better every week.
[Amanda and Eric laughs]
Amanda: Oh, buddy.
Julia: It can only go up from here.
Eric: That's true. It's such a low bar now. You’re just like, “Oh, I rolled a 12” and everyone's like, “Yes.”
Julia: Excellent.
Eric: Yes, my son.
Amanda: My son. My son.
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: Hey, that was another episode of the After Party. We'll be back with a new episode next week. See you later.
Julia: Later.
Brandon: Bye guys.
Amanda: May your rolls trend ever upward.
Outro Music
Eric: Pew, pew, pew.
Julia: I know. I know.
Amanda: [Inaudible 1:00:46]. I think it was good.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Yo, you could do it again.
Amanda: You, you can keep holding it.
Eric: Do you want to do it again?
Amanda: No, I want to do that.
Eric: Oh, okay. Good. End Scene.
Amanda: Yay.
Eric: We did it.

Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party...
Eric (to the tune of “Jingle Bells”):
Italian mob
They are rising
Hey, Aunt Min!
She’s surprising
Milo’s spy dad
Seems really rad
Winter Lake Town City wonderland
Aggie join up
Emily’s saying
Fix LTC
and she’s paying
What could unfold
As it’s getting cold
Winter Lake Town City wonderland!
Let’s get the party started.
[Theme music]
Eric: As the three of you come to Dr. Morrow's house wearing all of your winter garb and your boots and fingerless gloves, I assume.
Brandon: Yeah, all of us.
Julia: Correct.
Eric: And all of you have fingerless gloves, and Val's wearing all of them. January greets you at the door, and you see January's fur has like patches of white in it.
Julia: Aww!
Eric (as January): Yeah, you know, it's just it's part of the molting process is just the winter that's, you know, winter is here.
Eric: And as you give January your coats, I would love for you to describe to me what your winter garb is.
Amanda:
Aggie is wearing long johns under her cargo style work pants, two pairs of socks under her winter boots and a sort of thermal layer under her flannel. And then a slightly heavier Carhartt jacket along with a beanie from the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: Beautiful.
Brandon: Milo's just wearing a nice pair of, like, waterproof boots, jeans and a hoodie and a beanie.
Julia: Very cute.
Eric (as January): Oh, you're one of those people. You're like—
Brandon: Well, you know, every time someone asks him, he's just like,
Brandon (as Milo): I don't know, just not that cold. It's just not that cold.
Eric (as January): Please be honest with me. When did you put your shorts away?
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): I don't know. I don't own shorts.
Eric (as January): Was it before or after Halloween? You just need to tell me. I need to know.
Julia: Is Milo one of those people that wears jeans throughout summer, no matter how hot it gets?
Brandon: I think Milo doesn't go outside much, so it doesn't really matter.
[Eric laughing]
Eric: Yeah, well, MMFFC is air conditioned, so it's fine.
Brandon: Yeah. He has to wear like nicer pants to work anyway.
Julia: And Val has on those fleece lined jeans that construction workers wear during the winter and then it's just like so many layers underneath the leather jacket, like it is like three flannels and like two long sleeved shirts. And they're just like ripping all of it off until it gets down to a beat up band tee with the sleeves cut off at the bottom, they just put the leather jacket back on over it. It's like,
Julia (as Val): Alright, I'm good. Very good.
Eric: Yeah. I think—
[Eric laughing]
Eric: I have this image of January folding every single layer you take off so January is like folding everything and put together the jacket closet.
Amanda: It's a pile like 15 inches high.
Eric: Oh, it's like almost to their face 100%
Amanda: Awww.
Julia: Adorable!
Eric (as January): Yeah, well I— listen, Dr. Morrow wants you in the back, so just just head on back there.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks. Thanks, January!
Julia (as Val): You're looking adorable. I like the white.
Eric (as January): Thank you, I appreciate it. Just be very— this this stack is very precarious. Give me a wide berth.
Julia (as Val): I promise you it's just going to wrinkle anyway. So do not like feel obligated to continue folding it if it falls over.
Eric (as January): Appreciate it. Thank you.
Eric: Okay, so yeah. So January puts all of your winter clothes in the hall closet right by the front, and you all head into the back towards the big shed. Aggie, can you roll perception check for me?
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Certainly, that's a 13.
Eric: Wonderful! Aggie do you usually keep your cell phone like on silent or I guess I, I need to remember what a Motorola Razr used to use.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: So how I guess how often do you you check your phone?
Amanda: Aggie has a personal cell phone that she almost never checks and a work phone that she checks whenever it vibrates, but it's usually kept on silent.
Julia: Aggie does feel like a two cell phone kind of person. I say being married to a two cell phone person.
Amanda: I think she'll leave the personal phone at home sometimes and just carry the work done by accident.
Eric: Yeah, I think that is you're taking off your jacket. You check your work phone before you put it away and you have a text from Quinn that was sent like five minutes ago that says,
Eric (as Quinn): Hey, I reached personal, but I guess I just I also then found a piece of paper on which to work, phone down and just found it. But it's cool, I'll just see you later.
Amanda: We don't have plans for later, do we?
Eric: No.
Amanda: I think as Milo and Val start to walk toward the back, I'm going to call Quinn using the work phone and just check really quickly if everything's okay.
Eric: Sure. You give her a call and then you hear
Eric (as Quinn): Hello? [Hello echoes]
Eric: Through the phone and then you hear hello, like 50 feet down the hallway as Milo and Val opened the door. That goes to the super fun zone. And you see that Quinn is like looking around. And she's like,
Eric (as Quinn): Oh my god! Are you Aggie's friends? [Voice echoes]
Amanda: Aggie's shoulders slump and her head rolls back. And I think January probably gives her a reassuring pat on the leg.
Julia: This is very cool.
Eric (as January): She's really nice.
Amanda (as Aggie): That's what they all say. okay, let's go.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah. I mean, we're co-workers. I think we're friends. But yeah, I told them about your goo, Quinn.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, that was weird.
Julia (as Val): Oh. Oh yeah. You did. You did mention something about goo.
Amanda (as Aggie): This is my youngest sister, Quinn Quinn, these are my colleagues, be nice.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): And I'm Dr. Cassandra Morrow, the mayor. Hello.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, Dr. Morrow.
Julia (as Val): Dr. Morrow we know who you are.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I thought everyone was introducing themselves. I just wanted to get it on it.
Brandon (as Milo): You do it every time we see you.
Julia (as Val): It was our first time.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's a it's honestly a reflex. I'm sorry.
Julia: Val kind of just like goes up and is like
Julia (as Val): I really liked to you as a Porsche at the Shakespeare in the park a couple of years ago.
Eric (as Quinn): Oh well thank you! I thought it was really interesting to do a spin on The Merchant of Venice where everyone had like dropped shipping companies. I just thought that was such a like a really interesting.
Julia (as Val): Yeah, I didn't super-get it, but I thought you were really good.
Eric (as Quinn): Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh. Are you an actor?
Eric (as Quinn): Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh extremely.
Brandon (as Milo): Would you have been anything I've seen.
Eric (as Quinn): No, no, but I'm I'm very good.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright. okay, we don't have much time. I've been working on this a lot, and I just I'm very excited about it. I think everyone just hop the danger fun box.
Brandon (as Milo): You changed the name!
Julia (as Val): I still do not like the name, like any variation of that I'm not a fan of.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Would you like more fun or would you like more danger?
Brandon (as Milo): Or box!
Julia (as Val): More danger because like fun implies we're going to have fun there and not get burned by lava.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Are we not having fun? I thought this was fun.
Julia (as Val): Burning lava is not super fun for me as a person who feels pain and emotion.
Brandon (as Milo): Your name is Vulcani.
Julia (as Val): Does that mean I am resistant to fire?
Eric (as Quinn): Did we give each other names? Do we give each other names I want a name!! Aggie give me a name!
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn,your name is —
Eric (as Quinn): STICKY LASS!
Amanda (as Aggie): My sister, who doesn't know how to wash dishes. That's your name!
Brandon (as Milo): Got 'em!
Eric (as Quinn): Goo Girl! No, I don't want goo associated with me.
Julia (as Val): Yeah, goo ain't good.
Brandon (as Milo): With three O's.
Amanda (as Aggie): Can we just before we go into the danger phone box, by the way, at my request, is for the word box not to be in there whatsoever. Dr. Morrow, I know you wanted to meet Quinn because, you know, she's a lil different just like all of us. But what are we doing here? Like, Quinn you are have—you have a job. You can't be like a part time LTC protector.
Eric (as Quinn): I mean, I I mean, I could.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): She definitely could we could use more bodies. Absolutely.
Amanda (as Aggie): I thought we talked about in the group chat not bringing more attention to the fact that we are seven red headed, superpowered siblings.
Eric (as Quinn): Yeah, but I just you know, I just wanted to help. I don't have to go in the super fun time box if you don't want me to. I can just I can just wait and just see, like, you guys doing it. But, you know, Dr. Morrow invited me and I just wanted to hang out. I thought I wanted to, you know, learn stuff like you and be like my favorite older sister.
Amanda (as Aggie): I see what you're doing and I am falling for it. I want you to practice with us, that's for sure. All I'm saying is I— we talked about the fame thing, and I, I just don't know if going out on like missions or what have you is going to be the best choice. But you can hang out with us.
Julia (as Val): I would like to see goo powers in action, that would be very cool. But then also like her, just practicing with us doesn't mean that she's going to get a costume and become a superhero Aggie, it's okay!
Eric: Aggie, you turn back and Quinn is now hanging from the ceiling, like with three of her limbs.
Julia (as Val): That is so cool!
Eric: And then the other one, she's holding your domino mask from the Preserver. And is like
Eric (as Quinn): Also you forgot this at home, but I mean, if I put this on, no one will recognize me. Right?
Eric: And she puts it on.
Brandon (as Milo): Woaah!
Eric (as Quinn): Well, it could be anybody.
Brandon (as Milo): Where did it go?
Eric (as Quinn): I'm Climbing Girl!
Eric: I rolled a nat 20 to steal the domino mask from you by the way.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, let's let's go in. I'm just saying I don't want you to get excited to get your hopes up, but I want you to hang out with us and I want you to have better control of your powers, Ms. Suspended above the lumber in House Warehouse.
Eric: I'm laughing at House Warehouse.
Eric (as Quinn): Well, I guess, Aggie, this is up to you. You just want me to wait, or do you want me to be a part of it?
Amanda (as Aggie): Come on, we have butts to kick and—
[Eric cheering]
Julia (as Val): Butts to kick!!
Eric: And instead of climbing down the rope ladder, she just goes like bump, bump, bump and climb down on her like she has sticky like plungers on her hands. It's like, [makes suction noises]
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, how about the Plunger?
Eric (as Quinn): That's terrible. Never again.
Julia (as Val): You know, I'm just saying, like, we don't have anyone who's super sneaky on the squad yet.
Brandon (as Milo): Like, I'm not I'm a literal I'm a literal ghost, come on.
Julia (as Val): I mean, yeah, but sometimes you just, like, light yourself on fire too. So that's kind of obvious, and make giant panthers.
Brandon (as Milo): That's fair, that's fair.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): We have no time to lose! Let's go!
Eric: Dr. Morrow throws the door closed. Dr. Morrow also gives you your costumes because she thought that it would be more fair if you guys had your costumes. You can choose to put them on now if you so choose. But you have that in your inventory.
Brandon: Oh, yeah, I'm going to put mine on now.
Julia: Already in it.
Amanda: Alright.
Brandon: I've disappeared. Where did it where did I go?
Eric: Quinn is still wearing your domino mask.
Amanda (as Aggie): Do you see my hat Quinn? It's awesome.
Eric (as Quinn): Oh, can I touch it?!
Eric: And she touches it
[Quinn screams]
Eric (as Quinn): Paper? Oh, papercut, right.
Amanda (as Aggie): It's like those parking spikes that you seem still not to fully understand. But when you go one way, you don't get cut. When you go one way, you do.
Eric (as Quinn): How if you go over it one way, why does it work? But when you go over, it just it should be the same both ways.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, well we'll revisit this later.
Eric (as Quinn): Science is amazing. I love science.
Eric: Dr. Morrow comes over the P.A. system and says,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay, so I thought maybe I gave you a little bit too many things to focus on at the same time and it was I did set a trap by giving Val a lock and key to deal with. So I thought that I would give you something a little bit more straightforward.
Julia (as Val): It's also a dog that kind of threw me for a loop.
Brandon (as Milo): We're going to fight a corgi,
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): [Gasps] NO!
Eric: And you hear like the super danger box spin
[Eric makes vibrating noises]
Eric: And like all of the bits and bytes put itself together. And you're in a lush jungle.
Brandon: Oh,
Eric: You look at the trees and it's just like a miasma of greens. And it's not nearly as hot before. But you can see it's definitely like the air is thick with water and musk of something. It doesn't smell like anything in the city.
Julia (as Val): This is nice. It's like we went to a sauna.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie):
Oh, Quinn, do you remember the Rainforest Cafe? It was just like this!
Eric (as Quinn):
With dad, oh my god!
Brandon (as Milo):
Is there gonna be chicken nuggets?
Eric (as Quinn):
I hope so. I don't think they had those, though.
Eric:
And Quinn points into the brush as you see something go like and something takes like one step forward and you see a little yellow eye and then some teeth. And there's like a really small Jurassic Park style velociraptor walks out.
Brandon: Is it small enough to be a pet?
Eric: Like the size of a medium dog.
Brandon: Oh, yeah! So, yes!
Eric: It's like she literally watched Jurassic Park and was like,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): NEAT! But what if smaller and then, like, made it 75% of the size was a little less intimidating.
Brandon: They are actually that size.
Julia: I was going to say fun fact. Velociraptors are only the size of modern day turkey.
Amanda: Oh my god, you nerds.
Eric: Dr. Morrow comes over and says,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You know, Jurassic Park is not actually accurate. So what you need to do is find the velociraptor that has the key around its neck and grab that one.
Julia (as Val): How many velociraptors are there?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Great question.
Eric: And you see twenty velociraptors surrounding you.
Julia: That's so many though.
Eric: And step out of the underbrush. So like one falls out of a tree, another one like three pop out of a bush and they all surround you snapping with their mouths and licking their weird dinosaur lips. Quinn says
Eric (as Quinn): This isn't—see, there's a lot more of them than there are us.
Eric: And that's when built from the ground up. You see Clippy wearing very short shorts and a crop top of a football team. You that definitely doesn't exist.
[Julia groans]
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn, this is a medium helpful robot.
Eric (as Clippy): Hello. Hi, I'm Clippy. I’m here now to help!
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, Clippy.
Eric (as Clippy): Hello!
Brandon (as Milo): How are you doing?
Eric (as Clippy): It's nice to see you, [computer voice] Milo. [Regular voice] I'm just kidding. I know your name is Milo. That was a reference from earlier. I remember things!
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, God, that's horrible.
Eric: And then a meteor flies through the sky and in the trail it says, find the raptor with the key, and over the P.A., you hear
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Three, two, one, go!
Amanda: Can I see if anyone has a key that we can see?
Eric: Yeah. Why don't everyone make perception checks
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 18!
Julia: 16.
Brandon: Well...
Julia: Brandon roll!
Brandon: 2 +7 so 9.
Julia: Oh, that's not bad!
Eric: Aggie, there is one velociraptor kind of in the eastern quadrant that has a big golden key with a red ribbon around its neck. You can see since there are twenty one raptors, you can see like each one are kind of in clumps in the cardinal directions around you. There's five to the north, five to the south, five to the east and five to the six to the west. And the sixth one in the western quadrant has the key around it's neck.
Brandon: Do we know based on our rules, like how far away or how long each quadrant is like how far away the last one is?
Eric: Yeah, I say like if you're going to do an AOE attack, if it's a 30 foot radius, like you can hit one quadrant with all of them at the same time.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: The Velociraptors are stocking forward and trying to get at you. So we're going to do this the same way you all get actions, and then the velociraptor.
Amanda (as Aggie): Guys, I see it to the West.
Julia (as Val): Okay, Milo you have any—
Eric (as Quinn): Which way is west?
Julia (as Val): Do you have any like like magic stuff that can mark the one so we like know which one it is if they they mix each other up?
Brandon (as Milo): I do!
Brandon: Is it within sixty feet Eric?
Eric: Of you? Yes.
Brandon: Oh sweet. Yes. So great idea.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I do!
Brandon: And I was going to cast faerie fire so I'm going to outline the raptor with the key around his neck in like a sort of like a galaxy purple green but like glittering light.
Julia (as Val): That's beautiful.
Eric: Okay, so that you can have the cube that's just touching that one. That's fine because it's in the back. What is your, what's the DC of this?
Brandon: 15.
Eric: Wonderful. okay, so the swirling galaxy comes out of your chest and he tries to surround this velociraptor and it goes
[Eric makes little roaring sounds]
Eric: And like it hops out of the way.
Julia: Dammit.
Eric: So it is not tagged by the faerie fire.
Brandon: Wow. What a dexterous little raptor. Alright I'm gonna roll for my—
[Eric makes roaring sounds]
Julia: Alright. I'm just going to go after it, is that cool with everyone?
Amanda: Oh yeah, me too.
Julia: I'm going to use my charger feat and just try to dash and melee attack it.
Eric: Okay, are you going to try to run through the crowd? Are you going to try to like end around? How do you do it?
Julia: Yeah, I'm just going to plow through it. I'm also I go into a rage too, so.
Eric: Wonderful, okay, as you run through it, there are four, you get four opportunity attacks.
Julia: Bring it on, come on.
Brandon: Oh my gosh.
Eric: Does a 16 hit?
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Wonderful. Does an 11 hit?
Julia: No.
Eric: Alright, as you barrel through these five velociraptors you take 18 points of slashing damage.
Julia: Is that half?
Eric: That has halved as they just claw you on the way out, they're like ""this is not how it works."" It is like has their little hooked claws and gets you across the chest as you barrel through.
Julia: Great!
Julia (as Val): The fire did more damage to me last time of it.
Eric: Did you do the spirit surge roll?
Brandon: I did, I got an 18.
Eric: Okay, wonderful.
Julia: Am I successful in hitting or getting to this velociraptor with the key?
Eric: If you're running through the gauntlet, you definitely get there.
Julia: Great. Then I'm going to just attack it I guess.
Eric: Do it!
Julia: Cool. Does an 18 hit?
Eric: Yes it does.
Julia: Great.
Eric: Do you want to do damage to it?
Julia: Yeah, because when I use charger I can only do a melee attack or a shove, so I have to do damage to it. Also if we can figure out which one of the bloodiest that also works just as well as the faerie fires.
Eric: That's fine!
Julia: So it is 4 bludgeoning damage.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: It is 2 fire damage plus rage, plus my strength. So that is 6, 8, 11 damage.
Eric: Wonderful. So this is the first time you're using your new volcano gauntlets. How it do? What does it look like?
Julia: It's like Val rears back and the thing just kind of lights on fire like a super saiyan.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Cool!
Julia: And then Val punches and I'm going to take my second attack as well.
Eric: Do it!
Julia: Cool. Does a 17 hit?
Eric: Yes it does!
Julia: Cool. Great again, that is 2, 5 so 7 +2 is 9 +3 is 12.
Eric: You yeah. You scorch this thing up. Yeah. You can tell one of these velociraptors is burned, has a bloody nose and it has a key around its neck.
Amanda: No!
Julia (as Val): It's that one, that one right there.
Brandon: I lean over to Aggie and I'm like
Brandon (as Milo): Uhh I know it's digital, but should we be letting Val kill this velociraptor?
Julia (as Val): I think Velociraptors are very cute, but this one does have a key that I need to destroy.
Eric: Clippy puts a hand on Quinn's shoulder and says,
Eric (as Clippy): Hey, you're new! I think whatever you're going to try is going to be great.
Eric: And she says,
Eric (as Quinn): Oh my God, thank you!
Eric: And Quinn is then going to be like,
Eric (as Quinn): Oh, this is what we do?
Eric: And she just starts running through the Velociraptors.
Julia (as Val): Oh, no, buddy, no. I am good at not getting hit about things! Like I'm fine, you're going to get all messed up.
Amanda: I'm going to step up the wind around the velociraptors to the back and try to grapple the guy with the key.
Eric: Oh, I thought you were going to say, Quinn.
Amanda: No.
Brandon: Eric, can I cast hold the person on Quinn?
Eric: I will give you know, you do that. Why don't you just try to make a dexterity save?
Brandon: Okay,
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Sometimes kids make their own mistakes, Milo.
Brandon: I don't want her to die. 17 +2 for 19.
Eric: Okay, wonderful. I'll come back to that and Aggie, make a grapple check for me.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a 10 but I'm going to use a luck point to reroll to it.
Julia: Do it!
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 16.
Eric: Okay, wonderful.
Brandon: Nice.
Eric: So here is the scene. So Val you just lower your shoulder, doing your Vulcani thing as velociraptors slash at you. Kilonova conures this galaxy ghostly swirl that tries to catch the velociraptor and then you put like a hand out to grab Quinn by the back of her very, very super soft and comfortable hoodie.
Brandon: Okay good I thought you were going to say sticky.
Eric: No, that's not sticky. A very, very nice hoodie that she's wearing. And Aggie, you're doing this end around to try to barrel down on this velociraptor and you get your hand around the key. You can feel the silk that they've somehow programmed into this into this danger box. And then everything goes [vibrating noises] and everything disappears, and you are all just back in the warehouse in darkness.
Amanda: Do I like whiff it and fall on the ground?
Eric: 100%
Julia (as Val): Well, that was pretty quick. That was that was much easier than the last one. Good job, team.
Eric: For a moment, you're just standing there for like 10 seconds. And then Dr. Morrow throws the door open and says,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): That wasn't me! I think everything ugh, god dammit, ugh. I thought, mmmm.
Eric: And then she goes over to the door and opens it, you can hear like the wind howling, and you even see snow just come in and blast her in the face and you feel the chill of like.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Accord—according to all my information, the snow was supposed to come later today, I don't know. Aw fuck, ugggh alright.
Amanda (as Aggie): Was there a power outage or something?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, yeah, and I guess there's no power anywhere.
Eric: She gets out her phone like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, there's a reason why I keep these on silent, or you would have heard all of the notifications I would have gotten because every— there is a power outage all over the city.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, no. I have to check on some residents.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, okay. I guess we'll have to we'll have to figure it out. That's fine. Alright, everybody, let's, just yeah, just give me a second.
Eric: And Dr. Morrow is getting on the phone and she's trying to make mayor phone calls for one, there's a major blizzard in the city.
Brandon: What do those sound like Eric?
Eric: It's like it's more like getting the plows to go and be like,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I don't care if you're eating lunch. There's the blizzard is happening. You need to get in that plow NOW!!
Julia: I don't care how good that sandwiches.
Amanda: Time and a half, boss.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yes. Everyone gets time and a half if you work in the blizzard. Yes.
Amanda: I'm going to call a couple of the elderly residents in Lake Town City and make sure everyone is okay and has their blankets and stuff like that.
Eric: Yeah, absolutely. I think you make your calls. I think everyone, the people who've lived there for a long time, when it gets that cold out, they know that a blizzard's coming, they'll have like their own remedies, like,
Eric (as an Old Citizen): You know, the middle of the wrist? That's how I know the storm coming! It's like the middle. It's like it's like a tree with the core. That's what tells you.
Amanda (as Aggie): My my point is, Mr. Davis, do you have firewood? You're all set?
Eric (as Mr. Davis): Oh, absolutely. But here's the thing, if my left wrist that's that's for rain! But my right wrist that's for snow! I can tell the difference.
Amanda (as Aggie): Great. I will check in on you later today, okay?
Eric (as Mr. Davis): You wanna hear more about my wrists?!
Amanda (as Aggie): You can tell me then, how about that?
Eric (as Mr. Davis): Okay!
Eric: So right now, yeah, you're just kind of like in this where it's like a gym. But if there's nothing in the gym and it's all just like green screen. So you're just like standing there as Dr. Morrow is just taking calls.
Julia: Alright.
Julia (as Val): I think we should leave because I've seen enough like sci fi movies where the holodeck or whatever turns back on and it starts and we can't get out of here. So I think we should leave now.
Amanda: Aggie grabs, Quinn by the shoulder and like yanks her outside.
Eric (as Quinn): Wait what—
Julia (as Val): Let's get some hot cocoa, maybe inside the house, the cabin.
Eric (as Quinn): But what happened with the rap— I was ready to fight the Raptors.
Brandon: Milo sort of chases up to Aggie and Quinn and says,
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, where'd you get that hoodie? It's really, really nice.
Julia (as Val): It's very soft.
Eric (as Quinn): Milo, I don't want to say this sound like I'm being a jerk, but it's very expensive. It's not even mine is Sersha Ronan's. It's like I like she got it from a grab bag at— you know, pick someone on the top 40 radio right now, it's not mine, it's from her party, that party that Sersha Ronan got that I now have that she loaned me.
Brandon (as Milo): Can I—can I have it?
Eric (as Quinn): No!
Amanda (as Aggie): She's good taste of what we said about her. I like that girl.
Eric: Quinn slips out of your grasp. Aggie, I roll to seventeen and she slips out of your grasp.
Eric (as Quinn): We hold. I was ready to show off my stuff!
Amanda: I got 21 dex check though.
Eric: Oh, okay. She slops over. She tries to slip away and she's running towards the wall to like grapple upon it like she's a tree frog and you again grab her by the hoodie.
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen, listen, I'm so impressed by your enthusiasm and that was a great move. Like Val cleared the path you were going to go get the dinosaur. I'm sad that it stopped, but Val's totally right. If the power comes back on, we don't know what would happen in that room.
Eric (as Quinn): Oh, that's true. Can I like. For for like five. Can I just, like, do like one flip?
Julia (as Val): Can we do flips in the house?
Amanda (as Aggie): You can flip all the way into the house? Oh yeah.
Julia (as Val): Do flips in the house.
Brandon (as Milo): You could do it for January.
Julia (as Val): Oh, I can show you how strong I am and can like lift you like a like a sack of like a sack of flour.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: What's another way of saying that?
Julia: I could lift you like a military press.
Eric: What's another way of saying that?
Julia: I can lift you like you're you're a mattress that I'm moving up into someone's house.
Eric (as Quinn): Nice. okay, that's fine, okay, but I'm not taking the ladder up.
Eric: And Quinn like sticking her way up up the ladder as Dr. Morrow is still making phone calls.
Julia (as Val): Maybe we should take the doctor out of here. I don't want to have to come save her later. Just a suggestion.
Julia: Oh, no.
Amanda: Eric's rolling.
Eric: Hmm what?
Julia: Alright, Val is just going to double back and grab the doctor and be like,
Julia (as Val): I'm just going to put you over my shoulder. You can do your mayor stuff as we walk back to the house.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I don't go, Murray, hold on. What's happened? I'm making mayor calls.
Julia (as Val): I know and you can make mayor calls from over my shoulder. We are going back inside.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I have two jobs!I have to do my second job. You are doing that just while standing there.
Julia (as Val): You can do it while I'm carrying you.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I am Doctor mayor Morrow!
Julia (as Val): I know that.
Amanda (as Aggie): And I am blizzard safety captain of the Lake Town Historic District. Let's go.
Brandon (as Milo): And I am Milo!
Julia (as Val): I rolled a 21 to pick up Dr. Morrow and carry them out of there.
Eric: Okay, yeah. You try to grab Dr. Morrow, and she is so slippery she slides in between your your arm and is like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I didn't I didn't do five years of mandatory jujitsu for you to throw me over your shoulder like I'm a sack of potatoes or a mattress. Then you might be moving in. your person with a van business.
Julia (as Val): Would you prefer like bridal style? Because I can do that. But I have seen enough movies where this is going to turn back on and we're going to have to save you. And I don't want to do that. I don't care.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's not go to the light. The energy is off. It's off everywhere. I don't know. Why would you try to save me?
Julia (as Val): I cannot talk to you when you clearly are not aware of the genre you are in .
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: As you're arguing about the genre with Dr. Morrow, then all of a sudden you hear against the side of the wall, like ten feet to the left of the door. You hear ""FOOOM!""
Julia (as Val): What did I say?
Eric: Something is pounding against the wall.
Brandon (as Milo): Do we think that's just the storm hopefully?
Julia (as Val): It is definitely not the storm. Come on. Think of all of the comic books you have read in your entire life.
Brandon (as Milo): It's a good point.
Amanda: I think Quinn and I are right next to the door, like next to the vestibule about to leave. Is there a peephole or can we perceive anything else apart from that loud thump?
Eric: No, you can't see anything out the door. There's a door, too, like what should be a work shed. So there's no, like, peephole or anything. But you can try to open it.
Amanda: Not yet, no.
Julia: Val’s just like,
Julia (as Val): Do you want me to open it? I'm still vibrating.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. I mean, hopefully it's nothing. But let's see.
Brandon (as Milo): Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Julia (as Val): Oh, okay, okay.
Brandon (as Milo): I have a ghost cat!
Julia (as Val): Oh yeah. The Ghost Cat. Send the ghost cat to do it!
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn, Milo has a ghost cat.
Eric (as Quinn): Oh is that a normal thing that people have, or is like a special thing?
Brandon (as Milo): No, it's just, it's mostly just me. I'm really powerful and cool.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: That’s Eric laughing also.
Julia (as Val): You're very rich. I feel like if someone had a ghost cat you would know about it.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna!
Eric: Tuna all of a sudden, like Tuna poofs into existence, lying on the control panel and is like Eric (as Tuna): What? I was taking a nap. But as dead people call it, it's just dead. What's up?
Brandon (as Milo): You were taking a death.
Eric (as Tuna): I was taking a death. Oh, a cat death. A quick cat death. There's a nine lives joke that I'm too tired to make.
Julia: Valid.
Brandon (as Milo): There's a big, like, big, huge thumping sound against the wall here. Could you check it out for us?
Eric (as Tuna): Which one?
Eric: And then you hear again THOOOOM, that's moving slowly towards the door..
Brandon (as Milo): That one. Yeah.
Eric (as Tuna): Oh, okay. Yeah, go check it out, that's fine.
Brandon (as Milo): Don't like do anything about it. Just see what you can see and come back please.
Eric (as Tuna): Okay, I want you to make an animal handling check Milo.
Julia: Please roll well, I beg of you.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Seventeen.
Eric: Wonderful, okay, a 17, Tuna is creating tension by like slowly moving over to the door and in between the thumps, the very loud booms happening against the wall Tuna phases through the door and there's a few seconds of silence. And you hear “mrrrow?” and Tuna then walks back in through the door covered in snow.
Brandon: Cute!
Eric (as Tuna): Mrrow, there's a bear outside. Did you invite the bear?
Brandon (as Milo): No?!
Julia (as Val): A bear?
Brandon (as Milo): How big of a bear?
Julia (as Val): Like a normal bear?
Eric (as Tuna): Well, what is— I'm just a cat. I don't know anything. How big is a regular bear?
Julia (as Val): Like standing up there almost like six feet—
Amanda (as Aggie): Six to eleven feet.
Julia (as Val): I was going to say six or seven feet..
Amanda: This is a question Aggie gets a lot from the middle schoolers.
Julia: Okay, fair enough.
Eric (as Tuna): Well, it's probably bigger than that if I were to make a guess. Is that bad?
Brandon (as Milo): Yes, it's bad.
Eric: Okay. Hey, everyone, make dexterity saving through, please.
Julia: Awww fuck.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: 14.
Amanda: 24!
Brandon: 14.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: Twins!
Brandon: Twinsies!
Eric: So all of you are standing around Tuna who kind of moved away from the door as they were telling you all of this information.
Brandon: I want you to know the Tuna has a +2 to dex rolls. So if they get out of the way, that would be great.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: Yeah. And they're like,
Eric (as Tuna): Oh, it's it's kind of a big bear.
Eric: And then the door flies off of its hinges as a massive black bear leans into the control room and just roars right at all of you.
[Transition note]
Eric: Hey, it's Eric, I would usually talk about all my favorite Halloween stuff, like watching hocus pocus and saying the word yobbos out of context, but right now I'm just going to say go out and vote, please. This is the most important election in a lot of our lifetimes. And, you know, Donald Trump just can't be in the office anymore. He can’t, this is all just going to get worse if you want anything in return to some kind of normal and then push beyond normal to make normal better than what we had originally in 2015. Just vote. Please go out and vote, make a plan, figure out you're going to do it early. Figure out if you're going to do the day of if you're in the mail something and go out and vote and don't vote for that fucking asshole.
This is the midroll.

And now, back to the show!
Eric: As a massive black bear leans into the control room and just roars right at all of you,
Julia: Val just roars back at it, intimidation check.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: Let me do it.
Eric: Okay, fine!
Julia: It's a 19 +5. 24.
Amanda: My God!
Eric: You're so wonderful. Yeah, give me a seconds, wait I give myself advantage of that. Wonderful. Well, I rolled a natural 1 on that second one. Yeah, you roar back at it. It's like in nature documentaries where the animal looks at the camera and be like, what is that? And then he regains composure and leans fully into the control room. And a lead swipes a mighty paw at Dr. Morrow, and grabs her by the back of the lab coat. And it's King Kong style is holding a pulling Dr. Morrow back out into the snow.
Brandon: Eric, is that an attack?
Eric: That the bears doing? Yes, it is an attack.
Brandon: Is Dr. Morrow within five feet of me?
Eric: Yeah, I’d say so.
Brandon: Great then that means I get to use my halo of spirits and launch some damage to this bear automatically.
Julia: Aw hell yeah!
Eric: Yeah, do it.
Brandon: It's doubled because I summon Tuna. So that is 6 damage to it automatically.
Eric: Hell yeah, alright. That's wonderful. That takes, it takes 6 damage. What does this look like.
Brandon: It looks like totally involuntary. Like I don't think Milo knows that he's doing it or that it really happens, but you sort of just see, like almost like ghostly water droplets, sort of like exuded from my chest and just like fling at the bear.
Eric: I love that. It's like an automatic defense system. Yeah. It takes 6 necrotic damage as the bear drags Dr. Morrow out into the snow. And Dr. Morrow says,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, one of those things. Am I right? Can you see why we have a generator in the back— or we have a generator in the house. So you could just, like, turn it on. It's in the basement.
Julia (as Val): You're very okay, hold on.
Julia: I'm going to cast a cast bonfire with my gauntlets on the arm that is dragging her away. Eric: What does this volcano look like?
Julia: I like the idea of Val kind of like slamming their hand onto the floor and then like, right where they want it to, like, explodes like a volcano.
Eric: Hell yeah!
Amanda: Cooool!
Brandon: That’s dope!
Eric: Oh, yeah. The volcano erupts inside of a control room just centered on this massive bear. But it’s like the bear is has been wary of fire before.
Brandon: Classic bear!
Eric: And moves out of the way out of his own self-preservation and like moves Dr. Morrow in its hand as the claw is flinging around. And she's like,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, you know, it happens! December, am I right?
Amanda: I'm going to use my hat to do a melee attack on the bear twice.
Eric: Yeah, absolutely.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Does an11 hit?
Eric: 11 does not hit.
Amanda: I'm going to use a luck point to reroll. Does a 13 hit?
Eric: A 13 does not hit.
Amanda: Alright, let's try my second attack.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: A 12 I'm going to try one more time.
Brandon: Man, these bears are tough.
Amanda: Critical 1,
Julia: Hoo boy bud.
Eric: Oh no.
Amanda: It’s the first time I'm using it, so I think I'm just not used to it yet, but I am going to try a stunning strike. So I'm going to use a ki point to ask them to succeed on a constitution saving throw. If not, they're stunned until the end of their next term.
Brandon: I like the idea of you asking this bear to do succeed on the Constitution saving throw.
Julia: Excuse me, Bear.
Eric: Yeah, I think you try to cut into the bear and it's like it's fur is you can't slice through the fur. There's just so much fur. It is a giant black bear, and the bear is now has pulled Dr. Morrow into the blizzard. So here's the way this is going to go. This is going to be a lot looser, these things are just like movement, and you can run around in more things. But right now, the bear is try to take Dr. Morrow and just like run away. So Dr. Morrow is like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I forgot to say, it's fine. I have a long johns under this. Just try to turn on the generator.
Julia (as Val): Why?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, no, it's fine, don't worry about it. It's cool!
Julia (as Val): No, I mean, like, how is that going to stop a bear from taking you away?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, no, I you know,—
Julia (as Val): No, I don’t know, that is why I am asking!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Just turn on the generator, January’s probably confused. Just turn on the generator.
Julia (as Val): Alright. Just someone want to go turn on the generator while the rest of us try to keep this bear from running away with the doctor in the meantime?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I can.
Amanda (as Aggie): I can just text January.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh that's a great idea.
Julia (as Val): Yeah. We could just text.
Eric: Yeah, yeah. You could text January.
Amanda: I like text January real quick Dr. Morrow, kidnapped by bear says turn on generator in basement.
Eric: Wonderful. okay, we'll deal with that.
Amanda: By accident. I send it with the fireworks text effect.
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: Jesus.
Eric: Yeah, the bear is takes its whole time and it just trying to run away from the house. It's trying to run away into the forest behind Dr. Morrow’s house.
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn, get in on this.
Eric (as Quinn): Oh is it okay if can I get in on this?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yes!
Julia (as Val): Can you, can you goo the bear.
Brandon (as Milo): Goo the bear! Goo the bear!
Amanda (as Aggie): Goo the bear!
Eric (as Quinn): I can't shoot goo, can I shoot goo??.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think you can, why not?
Eric (as Quinn): I don't think so!
Julia (as Val): Okay!
Eric (as Quinn): I got, I got this.
Amanda (as Aggie): Remember those slimy hands that you used to put on the cat. Try that.
Eric: I just rolled a Nat 20!
Brandon: Oh my god!
[Everyone cheering]
Eric: I love that happens cause like “okay, it's fine!” And Quinn just like takes a running start and then throws herself at the bear and just like lands fully like a frog on a on a rock just lands on the bear's back, and is like holding on and she's like
Eric (as Quinn): Okay now what?
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn this is not what I meant.
Eric (as Quinn): This is I what I can do with my powers!
Brandon: Milo turns to Val like
Brandon (as Milo): Hey Val?
Julia (as Val): Yeah?
Brandon (as Milo): Is Quinn cute?
Julia (as Val): Yes, is this—was this really a question?
Amanda (as Aggie): Not now Milo!
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Julia: Okay, I'd like to charge your feet and just go attack this bear.
Eric: Yeah, do it!
Julia: First attack, 15 +6, 21!
Eric: 21 hits.
Julia: Sweet, alright, 2 bludgeoning 4 fire or 11 and then an additional 5 for charger. So 16 total.
Eric: Wonderful.
Julia: And then I'll take my second attack.
Eric:Yay!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Great. It's an 8 +6, so 12 is not going to hit, right?
Eric: No, this is not happening.
Brandon: At the same time, can I cast and entangle and make the area in front of the bear difficult terrain?
Eric: Yeah, sure.
Brandon: You have to succeed on a strength saving throw.
Eric: Oh, good. I don't think a giant bear will have good stuff.
Julia: No, probably not. It's probably all min-maxed to charisma and intelligence.
Eric: That's true, it's it actually it's holding a wand. It has a star on the end.
Julia: And it's got a hat that we just noticed
Eric: Yeah, it's one of the floppy wizard hats with stars and rainbows on. Yeah, what am I trying to beat?
Brandon: You have to hit 15.
Eric: Okay, I got a 16 unfortunately.
Brandon: Dammit.
Julia: Fuck.
Eric: So yeah, I like the idea of the what is your combo? Like heavy? I think you guys have worked together a little bit. What is the combo working of Milo and Val together? What does this look like?
Julia: I think it's like Val charges forward and Milo shoots the spell ahead of them so that by the time Val gets there, hopefully the spell is done what it needs to do so that Val can put the killing blow in, so to speak.
Brandon: Yeah, when it's all successful, the bear would have been held down so Val could have punched the crap out of it.
Julia: Punch punch punch.
Eric: But I do like Val running up and then we've established that entanglement are like hands coming up from the snow. So like there's a snow on the ground already and there's snow whipping everywhere, and then these hands come out, come out of the ground that the bear just like slashes at and fades away into the wind. And then Val, like, comes out of like the lack of the visibility and just like slams this bear with your fire fist.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And with Quinn and Dr. Morrow got stuck on the bear in different places. January texted you back with the photo. He’s like you down a storm basement, and there's like what used to be like a really fancy, like beeps and boops on a generator. And there's a giant slash through it.
January was like,
Eric (as January): Uhhhhhhhhh can do.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, you and Dez come out here ASAP, Dr. Morrow in danger.
Eric (as January): Oh, Des isn’t here. Dez is like at his house.
Brandon (as Milo): Dez doesn’t live there
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, you stay safe then January and try to see if there's another power source.
Eric (as January): Desz is like is like cross country skiing in this, he loves this.
Julia: This is very cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): Dez would have—
Eric (as January): Dez is really cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): I bet he has really great sweaters for that. okay, let's go.
Eric: It's a sweater weather like Sprocket's like into it. I love that. It's like a Christmas sweater, but it's like—
Amanda: Alpine but with like nuts and bolts.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: That's so good!
Julia: Gismo gears I like that.
Eric: Yeah, so Dr. Morrow's like,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Hey!
Eric: She's like flapping around in the wind and the snow and like the bears fighting off Val at the same time, and Dr. Morrow’s like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): So hey, did you get the generator? Is it— is it fine?
Amanda (as Aggie): The bear destroyed it. I'm sorry.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh nuts. I coulda shoulda seen that one coming, huh?
Amanda (as Aggie): Quinn, try to grab Dr. Morrow and get off the bear.
Eric (as Quinn): Okay!
Eric: Aggie, I think you only see, like, the shadows of this because of the lack of visibility. And you see, like one shadow is coming over the shoulder of the bear as the bear like looks at that and then roars, the shadow is like all over the bear's face. And the other form that is in the bear's hand just falls to the ground. And Quinn is like
Eric (as Quinn): Was covering the bear's face when you meant?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yes. Now jump off!
Amanda: Okay, I'm going to step of the wind forward to grab Dr. Morrow and hopefully my sister.
Eric: Wonderful, you sprint forward just cutting through the snow and the wind. You're almost like a snowmobile cutting through the snow on the ground. You see everything happen, and Quinn is just like still covering the bear's face. And she, like, jumps off like she's released from a spring. And lands on the ground gracefully, and Dr. Morrow, who had been on the ground previously, is now standing and is hop to her feet like,
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Hey, you'll never catch me alive, bear!
Amanda (as Aggie): Would you come inside right now?
Eric: She touches a button on her shoes like skis pop out and little rocket boosters on the back, she’s like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Don’t worry! I got it, turn on the energy for the whole city, can you do that?
Amanda and Julia (as Aggie and Val): No!!
Amanda (as Aggie): WHAT?!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well, I don't take the bear away.
Julia (as Val): Well, how do we turn on the energy for the whole city? That's a wild thing to assume we could do!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's downtown. You got it. I got to leave the bear away!
Julia (as Val): What?!
Amanda (as Aggie): What?!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): What?
Eric: The rockets are like warming up.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): What you want me to be more specific?
Julia (as Val): Yes. Where is it? Oh, it's in my office in MMFFC!
Eric: And then Dr. Morrow just blasts into the forest on skis, and she you even see her like pumping her arms as she fades away and it's like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Byeeeeee!
Eric: And the bear roars and like clumps over her running and galloping.
Brandon (as Milo): Dr. Morrow is my hero.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I knew thaaaaaaaat!!
Julia (as Val): I just wish she was more specific about stuff, you know?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah.
Eric: Quinn is like
Eric (as Quinn): It's cooooold!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah. So I guess we have to turn on power for the whole city now?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): I feel like there are people who can— Milo can you text your boss at MMFFC and see if he is around and could do this for us so we don't have to go all the way across town?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I mean, that's a good idea, yeah!
Brandon: Milo pulls out his phone and he does a group chat with all of his friends, and a single chat with his boss.
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: Yeah don’t include your boss in your group chat.
Amanda: I was about to say Brandon, don't cross the streams, don't cross the streams.
Eric: Sorry, before this happens, as you pull your phone to text in the wind and the snow is whipping around you and only getting worse, I want all of you to make constitution saving throws. This is going to be for the snow and for the wind. Right now, you're only outside in your costumes, so I need you to beat a 12.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: I got a 23.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 17.
Brandon: Well, I got a 5.
Eric: Milo you are chilled to the bone by standing outside because you sweat a little bit and it just like really got inside you. I got to 6’s my man. I'm sorry. You take 12 damage.
Brandon: That's okay. I get temporary hit points because Tuna's around. So I still have 35.
Eric: Wonderful!
Julia: Val is just going to be like
Julia (as Val): I am only doing this because I'm very concerned about you.
Julia: And just like pulls him into a hug like from behind and just like
Julia (as Val): Please take some warmth.
Amanda (as Aggie): Let's get inside guys, come on.
Brandon (as Milo): This is simultaneously awkward and very affirming of our friendship.
Julia (as Val): I know it's like we're going to prom, but also like you told me, because you're almost froze to death.
Amanda (as Aggie): And they shuffle like that up the back steps into the house.
Eric: 100%
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Okay, so you're now inside of the house, so you're not in the snow in the wind anymore. But all the lights and the all the energy and stuff is still off. So it's getting kind of chilly in the house. January hops up to you wearing one of Val’s layers. I think it's like one of the flannels being like
Eric (as January): I was cold, but I already refolded, it's fine.
Julia (as Val): That's alright, you can use it. Does the doctor have like a fireplace or something like that in here?
Eric (as January): Oh, yeah, definitely. Oh, you just go into the—in the room that looks like a safari trophy room.
Julia (as Val): Cool.
Eric: It's the one with the animals on the wall that also has Scooby Doo masks.
Brandon: So Val shuffles with Milo wrapped up inside of their coat and I was in a cast create bonfire in the fireplace.
Eric: Wonderful. Hey, was entangle a spell?
Brandon: Yes, I did not roll
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 14.
Eric: Yeah what do you at now?
Brandon: 4.
Amanda (as Aggie): So Milo, can you ask one of your colleagues to check in Dr. Morrow's office?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, that's a great idea!
Brandon: And Milo is going to take his phone and do a group chat with his friends and a separate chat with Mr. Brewpot.
Julia: Brewskiiii!
Brandon: Texts his friends be like,
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, any of y’all at the museum right now?
Brandon: And then Mr. Brewpot’s is like,
Brandon (as Milo): Greetings, sir.
Amanda (as Aggie): Please call him Milo. It is your boss. Please just call him. Doesn’t anybody our age call anyone anymore?
Julia (as Val): No, I understand phone calls are scary.
Brandon (as Milo): I don't want him to hear anybody's voice on accident like in the background, you know?
Eric: So Mr. Brewpot gets back to you first. He says,
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Hey, buddy, what are you, no, no, not at work during a blizzard. Are you at work during a blizzard?
Brandon (as Milo): No, I forgot. My favorite comic book at the museum, when I was going to see if I could come get it, because we're going to be snowed in, I want to read it, but never mind. Thanks. Have a good blizzard. Stay safe!
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Okay, thanks. Wear plenty of layers and make sure do you are you a firewood right?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, of course.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Okay, even if you're in Company town, you need firewood.
Brandon (as Milo): Of course. Of course. Thank you. Thank you for your guidance and your—
Julia (as Val): Wisdom.
Brandon (as Milo): And that. Thank you. Thank you.
Eric: He sends back
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Our deepest fears now that we are inadequate. Our deepest fears that we are powerful beyond measure. Nelson Mandela
Brandon: And Milo just thumbs up it, thumbs up the text.
Eric: So your group kicks back and there's a photo of Apple taking a selfie from an incredibly high angle of him and Zach Rose in his apartment playing N64 and like Zach is holding a very, very large cup of hot cocoa. Apple’s like
Eric (as Apple): HAHAAA!
Eric: It's in all caps.
Eric (as Apple) We skipped! Smarter than you!!
Eric: And Lucas follows up by a photo of him at his desk in like.
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah I didn’t , check my weather app before the blizzard.
Julia: Thank God for Lucas.
Brandon (as Milo): Classic Lucas.
Eric: And then like three snowmen in a row.
Brandon: So I'm going to call Lucas right away.
Eric (as Lucas): Hello, this is Lucas’ on phone, Lucas speaking.
Brandon (as Milo): Why do you why do you answer your phone that way?
Eric (as Lucas): What if Mark Cuban was calling me and I needed him to think I was super official? That's why.
Brandon (as Milo): Why would Mark Cuban be calling you?
Eric (as Lucas): Why wouldn't Mark Cuban be calling me? And then why would I have Mark Cuban? Just what you think? I have Mark Cuban contact and I know what it is like what I think it's you calling me and then—
Julia (as Val): Milo, focus!
[Eric and Julia laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): I have a very important thing. We need to turn on the generator inside of the museum to turn the power on to the rest of the city. Can you do that?
Eric (as Lucas): What, there's a generator inside, Dr. Morrow’s where is there a generator?
Brandon (as Milo): Dr. Morrow’s, just listen and I'll tell you.
Eric (as Lucas): How would I get in Dr. Morrow's office? It's incredibly locked.
Amanda (as Aggie): Or a button, I don't think it's the generator itself. I think it's like, sorry, hi, this is Aggie O'Hare, nice to meet you.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): I think it's like a button or a switch or something. I don't know why, I hope it's a fail safe, but do what you got to do. She told us to open it. I ran into her plowing.
Brandon (as Milo): Dr. Brewpot’s keys are in his office. Is his office unlocked?
Eric (as Lucas): I mean, I can try.
Eric: and he gets up and you hear like
Eric (as Lucas): UUUUGGGGHHH.
Eric: and then like exaggeratedly hits things on the way over there and then he's like,
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah, it's locked.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, shoot.
Amanda (as Aggie): Your boss seems like somebody who might have a key, like taped to his door or on the doorframe or under a mat.
Brandon (as Milo): That's a great idea. Check underneath the coffee pot like the coffee maker in the break room.
Eric: And Lucas goes, “uuuugggghhhh” and then there's more clomping.
Brandon (as Milo):I buy you some Timbly Tomblieslis. If you just do this.
Eric (as Lucas): Fine.
Brandon (as Milo): God, I will buy you some jimbly jomblies. If you just do this!
Eric: Oh those are the helly filled ones! Jimbly jomblies, He goes over to the coffee pot and the reaches over and iss like,
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, there's something here.
Eric: And he grabs it like, oh, it's a an index card that says “Make a new key remember to do that.” Damn. Okay, well, well, I'm going to go back to what I was doing, playing switch which under three blankets. So I'll talk to you later.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks. You were no help at all. Maybe it's like, you know what those kind of things—
Eric (as Lucas): Who is that? Who is that?
Brandon (as Milo):That's— no, no, no.
Eric (as Lucas): What are you doing?
Julia (as Val): None of ya fucking business. Because one of those folding things outside his door. The keys in there?
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, like. Like the mail slot.
Julia (as Val): Yeah, yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): Just search. It's really important, Lucas.
Eric: Lucas just then goes
Eric (as Lucas): Uuugh okay, I can try.
Eric: Make a perception check.
Brandon: Okay, can I also include in this if I know what game he's playing on his Switch.
Eric: He's playing a Star Fox remaster.
Brandon: Mmhmm.
Julia: Good, good choice.
Brandon: I got a 5 +7 for 12.
Eric: Don't worry I also know that there is no such thing as that and I wish that it existed. Yeah.
So, Milo, as you're listening to Lucas clomp through now, he's like in the hallway, and he's like.
Eric (as Lucas) Hey, did you hear that?
Amanda (as Aggie): No.
Brandon (as Milo): Did I? No I'm on the phone, Lucas, how would I hear.
Eric (as Lucas): You didn't hear that, like, big crunching sound?
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, Lucas, go lock yourself in the basement.
Amanda (as Aggie): Lucas, run and hide right now.
Eric (as Lucas): Run and hide? Why would I do that?
Eric: And then the call gets dropped.
Amanda (as Aggie): Into my car, let's go.
Julia (as Val): Yeah. alright.
Eric: Wonderful.
Julia (as Val): We're going to drive in a blizzard. This will be safe.
Eric: Okay, for the rest of this, you do have one flashback. However, since you weren't prepared, you can't do any zero HP flashbacks. You have to give up some amount, if you want to do something like that is very improbable. That would be the 20%. And then you still need a roll on it if that was even possible for you to have done it. And then the 10% one is it needs to be at least possible that you might have prepared this beforehand.
Amanda: Okay, can I go first?
Eric: This one I'll give you for free. This one doesn't count against your vehicle. If you give up 10 percent of your HP, you took your car here. If not, you can try to find a vehicle somewhere else or see if Dr. Morrow has stuff.
Amanda: I definitely drove myself there in my own truck, but in wintertime, Aggie just has a plow on his truck at all times and she drives with it raised if it doesn't need it. And if a road needs paving, she'll just put it down. So this is true of the person Aggie’s is based on. But if you want that to be a flashback, I'm happy to pay for it.
Eric: I'll let you do it because your explanation was good, but you got to give me 20% of your HP.
Amanda: Alright.
Eric: Alright, so for your flashback. Yeah, I can see, unlike November 1st, you putting the plow on your truck and Mickey is looking at you from the mountain coffee like.
Eric (as Mickie): Aggie, we're not going to— Aggie, we're not going to get snow for weeks. It's global warming.
Amanda (as Aggie): Remember the Halloween storm of ‘91? I do.
Eric (as Mickie): I was four!
Amanda (as Aggie): I was three! You get your four memories that early.
Eric (as Mickie): Yeah, my first memories was like of Barney and my brother sticking me in the knee with a fishing hook. I don't remember snow.
Amanda (as Aggie): Awww classic.
Brandon: Aggie’s three year old memory’s putting a plow on a truck.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Eric: It’s watching your dad. Being like “Aggie, you need to remember, it's your responsibility to clear the roads. You can't always just wait for the government to take care of you.”
Amanda: When you move the clocks back, put the plow on, that’s what we always say.
Eric: Okay, so I'm going to give that one to you for free. So everyone still has one flashback. Amanda: 20% my hit points is 8. So I have 30 hit points remaining, but I still have a flashback available.
Eric: Yes, you do.
Amanda: So we can all pile into my truck and head out.
Eric: Let me give you some stats on your vehicles. So your vehicle, because you have the plow on, you have advantage on any sort of danger you might have in the snow. You can also use the plow. However, since you're your truck is pretty old, there is a possibility of a mishap. So something that happens with if your car takes a certain amount of damage, your car might have some problems. So if it takes over 10 points of damage, I'm going to roll on this mishap table that I have here. And your truck might have a problem.
Amanda: Delicious.
Eric: You do have a heater. So if you're in the car, you will not take the cold damage. But, you know, the heater might die if some bad stuff happens.
Amanda: I definitely have, like, a disaster blanket and a first aid kit.
Julia: Thank God one of us is prepared.
Brandon: I have a hoodie!
Eric: I just don't I naturally don't feel cold.
Julia: Remember how you took 12 points of cold damage? Shush.
Before we leave, I just want to say to January,
Amanda (as Aggie): You're going to be okay, right? I don't mean to offend, but I think you're kind of built for this weather.
Eric (as January): Yeah! Once all my white for comes in. I can evade predators super easy, but um, yeah, no, I’ll watch over the house. I think that the bear was that that wasn't a real a regular bear was it.
Amanda (as Aggie): Very large.
Eric (as January): Super, super big.
Amanda (as Aggie): Black bears are often very cute and small. Still dangerous.
Eric (as January): That's true. I believe black bears do grow to be within six to seven feet, and Stephen Colbert calls them terrible killing machines. I really miss The Colbert Report. Anyway! Anyway, no, it's going to be fine. I think that the house is fine. This is going after Dr. Morrow. The doctor will definitely be okay on her own.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, she keeps saying that. We're going to talk about that soon. Anyway, I'll text you.
Eric (as January): She's the doctor man. Look, what are you supposed to do?
Amanda (as Aggie): I will text you if we need you.
Eric (as January): Yeah, absolutely.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks January!
Eric (as January): Take all of your winter, you should keep your everything we talked about. There might be opportunity for you to, like, do stuff with your costume. So, you just keep— you know what, just keep those on and then you can like put a jacket over, over your stuff or you like just layer.
Julia (as Val): You can keep that flannel! You look adorable in it!
Eric (as January): Thaaanks!
Amanda (as Aggie): Because you look great in neon buffalo.
Eric: Wonderful. Yeah. See if you layer or add your winter clothes to your costume, then your cold checks will be better.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: I think I'll definitely throw my jacket on for sure.
Eric: I like it. You just look like a park ranger.
Amanda: Yeah. And I'm going to give Quinn the flannel that I had as well because I don't think that she is warm enough.
Eric (as Quinn): We can trade
Eric: And she gives back your domino mask.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, very generous of you. Thank you, Quinn. Into the back seat please.
Eric (as Quinn): Okay, okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Val, I would like you in front to navigate.
Julia (as Val): Alright. Sounds good.
Eric (as Quinn): Hey, Milo, just you can sit right here. I saved a spot for you!
Brandon (as Milo): I—I
Amanda (as Aggie): I changed my mind.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay?? No no it’s fine! Back seat’s fine!
Eric (as Quinn): Okay front seat. Yeah. I get to sit next to Aggie!! I’m controlling your music, I’m controlling the music!!
Julia and Brandon: No, no, no.
Julia: Gonna be a lot of top 40s.
Eric (as Quinn): I met Taylor Swift once!! She's very tall!
Julia (as Val): Yeah. That checks out.
Brandon (as Milo): Eric would you say that snow was water?
[Julia and Amanda laughing]
Eric: Can you be more specific?
Brandon: I know the answer is yes, so I'm just making sure that you're on board with me.
Eric: Okay, well, what about it?
Brandon: Well, I have this cantrip that's called shape water.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: I can only do it like up to five feet in front of me, but I want to use it to clear the snow away from the visibility in front of the truck so we have better visibility as we go down the road. Amanda: Nice, good thinking Milo!
Julia: Milo’s a goddamn water bender.
Eric: I'd say do that totally works.
Brandon: Cool.
Eric: I like the idea that the ghost hand in your chest like comes out and works like a window wiper.
Brandon: I love that. But like five feet in front of the truck.
Eric: So what I would say since is in the cantrip let's turn it into a concentration spell.
Brandon: Cool.
Eric: In order for you to maintain it like so you need to be concentrating on it. You might lose that concentration if whatever happens. The other thing I would say is since this only affects water and a five foot cube, you either can help Aggie's tires on the truck, which although it does have a plow and this is a truck driving in a blizzard, is dangerous. Or you can help Aggie's visibility, which would help Aggie drive.
Brandon: Aggie, what would you prefer?
Amanda: Yeah, I feel okay by navigating and driving in snow. I'm used to it, but the truck could always use help.
Brandon:Cool. Yeah. So I'm going to use shape water to move the ice and snow and water and sleet off of the road five feet in front of the truck.
Eric: I think that would definitely help with the ice because like you don't even know if the black ice is there. So it's like your ghost hand is extended down to the road, like clearing all of the ice out of the way, which is something that that a plow can't take care of, which I love. Yeah, that's right.
Amanda: Yeah, it's like a ghost plow in front of the plow.
Brandon: And the ghost doesn't even feel the cold because we're in a hurry.
Julia: Awww.
Eric: The ghost hand gives you a shaka. Yeah. So like yeah. You have like this arm that's like extending down to the road and you got to like press yourself up against the—
Amanda: So Milo’s in front then.
Brandon: Oh well no I think Quinn’s in shotgun. Do I have to like lean over the front seat to get—
Eric: No you don't have to do. No you don't. You're just pressed up against the door.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: You're like I need to get as close as possible. I'm joke because the range area is thirty feet, but I just thought it was funny. Wonderful! Yeah, you see, you guys can start driving from up north, try to get into downtown. Is there anything else you want to do before you leave the house?
Julia: I'm going to sit here and if there's something that's blocking our way that ain't snow or ice or whatever, I can go out and move it. So that's my contribution to the team.
Amanda: And I think I'll I'll tune in to a station five fifty, which is the local emergency channel.
Eric (as Radio Announcer): [In a mellow tone] Yes. You're listening to five fifty affiliate of Channel seven and a half. Hey, it's pretty cold out there. Like Jack Frost is nipping at all of our faces and my face. I mean city by Jack Frost. I mean the blizzard. I'm safe here at the radio station.
Brandon (as Milo): And this is a terrible radio station!
Amanda (as Aggie): This is emergency only. It's supposed to be nothing!
Eric (as Radio Announcer): But the emergency level is regular for the winter. Yeah, I know how it goes. alright.
Julia: What is this guy's name?
Eric: It's a great, great question. That's a great question, ghoulia!
Eric (as Radio announcer): This is Smooth Jenkins. I also run the Jazz Hour at 2:00 in the morning and again at 4:00 in the morning.
Brandon: Those not back to back?
Eric (as Jenkins): There is not, there's a fifteen minutes of silence and let it marinate.
Eric: Alright. Yeah. Does anyone else want to do anything before you drive over?
Julia: I think I think we're good for now.
Amanda: Make everybody buckle up. That's about it.
Eric: Of course, Quinn buckles up and she puts a hand on your shoulder and says,
Eric (as Quinn): Aggie, I'm so glad that I came today.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm really glad I came today too!
Eric (as Quinn): I'm going to be so cool and it's going to make all of you look really bad by comparison.
Amanda (as Aggie): You get the power on Quinn, I don't give a shit what you do.
Eric (as Quinn): You’ve been telling that to me ever since I was a child, I really finally it hits home.
Amanda (as Aggie): I love you, dude. I'm so proud of you. The Crusible was so good. I just I'm so glad I went down to see it anyway..
Eric (as Quinn): You guys remember when I was on that bear?
Julia (as Val): That was pretty cool
Eric (as Quinn): I was not— that was so wild.
Julia (as Val): It was like its jaws and it was I was like, oh, no. And then you jumped off.
Eric (as Quinn): I was on it’s back first and then I was on its face. Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): That was really impressive.
Eric (as Quinn): In a dangerous place. Aggie is this bad? And she has a cut going down her right arm.
Amanda (as Aggie): OH GOD.
Julia (as Val): OKAY!
Amanda: I lay my hands and cast healing hands on her.
Eric: Wonderful
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 4 +2 is 6, and then 7 + she was 9 for total of 15 hit points.
Julia: Ooooo.
Eric: Oh yeah. With 15 hit points. What is it look like when you use your healing hands again? Amanda: There is like an orange sparkly like glitter pen style glow that spreads all over the wounded area. And it's like the sparks kind of knit back together the skin.
Eric: I love that.
Julia (as Val): Can I get one of those too at some point? Because those velociraptors did mess with me.
Amanda (as Aggie): I can't do this on the roads, we better do it now before we leave and want to use the bathroom. And then I put my hand on Val's knee and I'll do that for you as well.
[Dice rolling]
Eric: Quinn runs and she's like,
Eric (as Quinn): Oh, hold on, I have to go to the bathroom.
Amanda: Oh, I rolled two 10’s in a row Julia, so you get 24 hit points!
Julia: Oh hell yeah. Back up to full health!
Eric: Wonderful. This is all going to be continuous, so please keep track of all your stuff so that Val your rage is done by now.
Julia: Diminished yes.
Eric: So Aggie, you shift into reverse. [Truck engine starts up] I feel like this is like one last splash panel at the end of the comic book. The truck's back lights pulling away into the storm and it slowly loses visibility as you drive forward. And then we just we're here with the snow and the wind and one remaining growl and the swishing of Dr. Morrow’s skis in the snow.

Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party,
Eric: Our powered friends tackled the Volcano challenge, grabbing three orbs before the time ran out. And that’s all that happened. Well, Aggie got blasted by a lot of lava, Val stole a corgi, and Milo refused to be jump scared. And Clippy was there. And they ignored a nice old man. The usual. But they did it! And learned a little bit about themselves along the way. [singing] And now we’re living in the Lake Town City world and I'm a Lake Town City girl la la. Let’s get the party started.
[Theme music]
Eric: After your training at the Fun Danger Zone/Little gym/palladium emporium—
Julia: Okay!
Eric: Of training—
Brandon: Oh wow this is getting better and better!
Eric: Yeah it does uh Dr. Morrow has released you from your training for the day. So in game mechanics all of you have gained half a level. If we were playing an experience points type game or we were playing an RPG or you were playing Pokemon, Brandon—
Brandon: I choose Julia!
Julia: [Like a Pokemon] Julia Julia!
Eric: Your experience points are half oh my god—I just got distracted by figuring out what Julia's pokemon name would be like “hey whuta-fu-du-ah forget about it”
Amanda: Let's say you just permitted Tom Nook to build you a basement, you are halfway to the 3 million bell loan.
Eric: Yes and the leveling up that we do in between sessions, kind of in between arcsl those are like full levels up but that doesn't take away from the experience points that you have from doing training. So if you lean into the things that maybe you're not so good at or you make some very important plays, I will give you the other half of your experience and you will get a full level up.
Amanda: Ooh a bonus level up!
Brandon: Cool!
Eric: Wonderful so after Dr. Morrow has you know read out your strengths and your weaknesses and your CO2 release, and your max heart rate, and how much you hit that—
Brandon: 12.5%! What up!! I don't know if that's anything…
Julia: I don't think it is.
Eric: Brandon here's the thing it was never anything so you're fine.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: And your max threshold. The three of you sweaty, can go out back into the world and do what you want to do. I would say that this is about probably late afternoon evening, we didn't say like what day it was so I kind of giving you free reign to kinda do whatever you want here. Brandon remember Milo can only speak in barks, and does understand the sounds of animals at this point.
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: This is very interesting. I have some ideas. Is there a zoo in Lake Town City?
Eric: Yeah you can go to this do you just want to go Milo goes to the zoo for the rest of section 14. We'll wipe that just imagine whatever it is, and we'll go to the next character. But yeah the three of you can kind of go about your day I think Dr. Morrow says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I really appreciate all of you taking the time to do training, and I think there's more to do here. I hope that it wasn't just keying in on your flaws, but enhancing uh the things that I know that you're good at, and what I want to show the city to do. Because you're so much better than Emily Slaughter, I just want everyone to know that.
Brandon (as Milo): Thank you!!
Amanda: Aggie tears up.
Julia (as Val): She sucks.
Amanda (as Aggie): Speaking of which, I think that we need to at least reach out to her to make sure she doesn't become like our super villain, um so I am going to text her and meet up for coffee or something see if I can just smooth things over.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh man her last name is Slaughter, she'd be such a good supervillain, we have to stop this!
Amanda (As Aggie): Yeah I think all the ingredients are there.
Julia (as Val): Solely because of the name, no other reason.
Amanda (as Aggie): And like just being really good at ebay is— makes me think that she's untrustworthy so—
Brandon (as Milo): Uh yeaaaah, yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): No offense Milo.
Brandon (as Milo): N-noone none take— none taken.
Eric: You know what she's keeping in that Google Calendar is a scheme no one that organized is using it for good.
Amanda: I totally agree with you.
Julia: Something to say with your partner sitting next to you?
[Brandon and Amanda laughing]
Eric: She's like Em—
Amanda: Julia, it's role-playing, we play other than ourselves!
Julia: Alright.
Eric: And Dr. Morrow finishes up after you guys all shit talk Emily Slaughter for like 10 minutes. just imagine and then like we kind of just end on it and she's like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): And that's also why I don't like her, I would love to set up— I would like to set up another training for the three of us I think that we made some really good progress and uh Aggie if you want to bring Quinn just to help fill in some information for her, I'm definitely happy to do this, and I think that the sooner we do it the better.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah I'll see if she's around, like I said she is she's filming something somewhere but I'll double check to make sure.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No problem.
Eric: Alright so what do you what do you guys want to do?
Amanda: I'm going to text Emily and say “oh hey my phone broke sorry I didn't return your texts. Do you want to grab coffee tomorrow?”
Julia: “My phone broke for three months, sorry I never texted you back.”
Eric: Well let me clarify this are you what is your strategy here for that text? Do you want her to actually think you broke your phone? Do you want her to think that you're lying to make her feel bad that you came up with such a bad lie? Like what is the what's the motivation here?
Amanda: I think it's just to say something nominal to address the fact that our last text was from like three months ago, and it was like call me back. Ideally I would like for her to believe that I'm at least making an effort to excuse myself, you know? Even if it's a lie.
Eric: Let's just do raw charisma then.
Amanda: I mean they're both 0 babe.
Eric: Oh okay.
Julia: I'm glad you leveled up your charisma so it's not a negative anymore.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Uh well it's a 4. So I'm going to use a luck point—
Eric: [Laughing] You’re gonna use a luck point on this, that’s amazing.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: That's a 6.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: Emily is unflappable!
Amanda: That was my last luck point fam, just so we're all clear.
Julia: Oh boy okay.
Brandon: You can— you could take a nap or something.
Eric: Aggie then sleeps for 18 hours until the meeting.
Amanda: I'm meeting her tomorrow.
Eric: Yeah that's fine. I think Emily texts you back and says
Eric (as Emily): Sure sounds great! Cat smiling emoji
Julia: Bad, bad, bad sign.
Brandon: That is a bad emoji.
Amanda: Aggie stops as she’s walking
Amanda (as Aggie): Guys, is the cat bad? Not the cat, this one?
Brandon (as Milo): Yes!
Julia (as Val): Any cat emoticon is bad.
Eric (as Emily): Yeah where do you want to meet up? I know this great matcha juice bar that is super close to my apartment we should go there!
Julia: [Laughs] Ohh power play.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh I usually just go to Mountain Brews you know it's connected to Mountain News in historic Lake Town.
Eric (as Emily): Oh uh— I don't I can't find my sky tram pass, so if you could come to me that would be super helpful.
Julia (as Val): Power play!
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay how is 11:00 A.M. tomorrow?
Eric (as Emily): Oh I have a phone call at 11:00, can we make it 11:45?
Brandon: Woooow.
Amanda (as Aggie): Let's just say noon then no worries.
Eric (as Emily): Oh noon’s great!! exclamation point exclamation point heart eyes cat.
[Julia groans]
Amanda (as Aggie): Guys I don't think this is gonna go well.
Julia (as Val): No, no it is bad.
Amanda (as Aggie): Val what are you doing at noon tomorrow?
Julia (as Val): I gotta walk some dogs in the morning, but like after that it should be fine.
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't think that I should show up with more than one person in terms of the power play, and making her feel like we're on even ground. Even though we're not and I'm better. Um but could you just like be kind of nearby?
Julia (as Val): Sure? Like I'll walk the dogs over there would that work for you?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah just just to be in the vicinity, and if I need you guys I'll call you.
Julia (as Val): Sure.
Amanda (as Aggie): Or how about this, I'll send you one of those cat emojis.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): I don't need your passive aggressive cat emojis!
Amanda (as Aggie): As the signal!
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric: At this point Tuna is now sitting on your head Aggie and says
Eric (as Tuna): Oh well it would be so fun if we were invisible, and just like kind of sat there like we were in a magical inflected Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna—Tuna, Tuna go away.
Eric (as Tuna): Okay
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna flash!
Eric (as Tuna): Okay okay fine.
Eric: And then there's like an audible poof, and Tuna disappears like Tuna is Salem in Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
Julia (as Val): I'm just saying the cat seems like it did have a good idea though.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh did it? I wasn't listening did it?
Eric: Sorry, hold on when Milo says “I didn't understand what Tuna said” you hear [dog howling noises]
Julia: Oh god.
Amanda: Whoops.
Brandon: God damn it.
Amanda (as Aggie): As fun as that sounds Milo no offense, once more, I think that the odds of the situation up if you and Tuna were present are much higher.
Brandon (as Milo): You know? That— that
Brandon: And then Milo goes on a very intelligent tirade about how Aggie makes sense, but he appreciates their friendship and is mildly hurt but understands the process but it's all in dog language so I don't have to say it.
Eric: It's just like one long howl.
[Howling]
Amanda: I just nod.
Julia: Like a beagle.
Eric: Wonderful alright yeah, so now you have a noon tomorrow with Emily Slaughter, Milo and Val if you want to do stuff before then we can uh come back around to the meeting with Emily Slaughter.
Brandon: I think I'm going to text my dad and see if he has time to like grab lunch or dinner tomorrow.
Eric: Yeah sure! It's weird you're typing and it's just woofs— no I'm just kidding.
Brandon: I like to go to his office if I can, but sometimes they don't have visitors.
Eric: That's a wonderful idea why don't you roll just a straight up d20 for me?
Julia: Mysterious.
Amanda: Luck roll! Luck roll.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 15.
Eric: Yeah you uh why don't you start this text conversation with your dad?
Brandon: Okay Milo pulls out his phone, as he's walking away from the group and texts his dad and says
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, you have time to have lunch tomorrow at the office?
Eric (as Hank): Oh hey bud!! (two exclamation points) We'll have to check if the CIA isn't going to bring sandwiches in, but it seems fine!
Eric: And then the okay emoji three times.
Brandon: Great yeah, Milo just like thumbs up reactions his text.
Eric: Nice your dad then sends you an article explaining that sharks are actually smarter than humans but they need to be below 100 feet in the water to keep their brains together, and once they go too far up they're just consumed by bloodlust, and he says
Eric (as Hank): PRETTY COOL!!!
Brandon: I read it and I don't sleep the entire night.
Eric: Let's roleplay Milo's insomnia just real quick!
[Everyone laughs]
Brandon: Okay well it just goes like this we soft cut into him on the couch clicking through the episode choices of Star Trek Next Generation until he chooses one that's not scary and then watches it on repeat over and over again.
Eric: You watch the tribbles episode for five minutes, and then turn it off for five minutes—
Brandon: Excuse me Eric that's original series!
Eric: I know, I was making a different reference!
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Wow I'm so glad Brandon fully sound designed that little vignette of Milo in dreamscape on the couch.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: I know it's beautiful right? It sucks that I had to cut it!
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Amazing, Val what do you want to do?
Julia: I'm going to go to Dominic's.
[Amanda gasps]
Eric: Oh wonderful you just want to go see Dom 5?
Julia: Yeah!
Eric: Do you uh give him the heads up?
Julia: No he's a restaurant owner, so obviously he's gonna be there.
Brandon: Julia do they have like a pizza of the day?
Julia: No what are you crazy?
Brandon: Okay so it's just like the classics?
Julia: Yeah—
Eric: [In a thick New York accent] The pizza of the fuckin’ day is the pizza I give you on the fuckin’ day!!!
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: That's correct sorry.
Eric: That was Dom 7, he really came out strong.
Amanda: He’s like 4 years old!
Julia: Dom 7 is like 5 years old four years old.
Eric: Yeah, yeah oh yeah 100%, 100% I'm glad we're all on the same page, we've been playing this game for long enough this is good, excellent. Alright yeah you're gonna head over I think by the time that you get back all the way to Little Italy because there was a delay on the skytram because some geese were sitting on the lines
[Amanda aww’s]
Eric: [In a New York accent] These fuckin’ Canada geese coming here making me late. [Regular voice] yeah I think that you make it over to Dom's I think after the dinner rush so it's a little bit later into the night. You walk up and uh you don't like see anybody inside, there's a sign on the inside of the door that says Dom's is closed for an event “get your pizza somewhere else you jamokes”
Julia: Well I'm gonna let myself in because Val's an employee.
Eric: For sure, for sure so you go in. Yeah it's um ordinarily I think if you there was an event like the tables would be pushed back, you'd have the catering trays and the little flames underneath and everything will be set up. But it's just like nobody's here now, the staff not another customer is just like you don't see anybody as you walk into the pizzeria.
Julia (as Val): Some fuckin’ event.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: I think Val's just gonna wander back to Dom's office, I guess?
Eric: In the back in Dom's office Dom is leaning against his desk like watching a Mountain Lobsters game on his tiny tv that he has up in the corner.
Julia (as Val): So are they winning?
Eric (as Dom 5): AHH! Val—Val, you need to— you can't just walk in when the door is locked and it said “hey p—” there is a sign that says “hey people don't come in” you can't just come in and ask me casual questions.
Julia (as Val): Well it did say “hey go get your pizza somewhere else” and I'm not here to get pizza.
Eric (as Dom 5): Is this is this a not somewhere else does is there a sign is there a neon sign replacing the sign that my great grandfather carved out of a wood he brought over from the old country saying “somewhere else”
Julia (as Val): I don't know how to answer that question because you know the answer already so I'm just going to be like “hey what's up” oh you can tell me if they're winning or not.
Eric (as Dom 5): Yes also okay get— get Val get out of here.
Julia: Can I do an insight check real quick?
Eric: Yeah for sure I just want to see what's up classic Dungeons and Dragons move!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Okay um it's a 14 +3, so 17.
Eric: Okay you've known Dom for a while Dom's the kind of person when he's nervous he can't sit still like he sits for 30 seconds and he stands for 30 seconds, and then like he'll put his foot up on a chair for 30 seconds, he'll stand in a different part of the room, and you feel like you saw him in the middle of this like choreographed dance of trying to keep his nerves down. He has a hand jammed into his pocket, and it's like he's holding on to something in his pocket.
Julia: Sure.
Julia (as Val): So what's the event tonight?
Eric (as Dom 5): Oh you know uh one of those western peoples wanted to get some “authentic Italian food” and I'm like “okay” and then they canceled at the last minute. So you know you don't have to work it—it's cool it's fine.
Julia (as Val): It sucks you lost out on a lot of money then probably tonight because you know we're usually pretty busy during the dinner rush huh.
Eric (as Dom 5): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah um [beat of silence] yeah uh Val I'm just gonna tell you this one more time get out of here. Unless you don't and then, that's fine but I want to tell you that I told you to get out of here.
Julia (as Val): Okay well I did come and I wanted to talk to you about some things that, you know, maybe I had been a little reluctant about in the past and now you don't seem particularly interested in those sort of things so, it just seems a little odd to me, that's all.
Eric (as Dom 5): Well what kind can you be more specific or what kind of things?
Julia (as Val): It's the kind of things you're not specific about—
Eric: When you say that the door opens and like there's a little bell over the door so it's just like [bell chiming noises] and you hear
Eric (as random voice): Hey uh can I get just whatever pies you have really I'm not picky just give me the just give me the pies!
Brandon: Is this me?
[Eric laughs]
Eric: No, yes Milo is in there.
Brandon: No, no Brandon is this Brandon?
Eric: Yeah, yeah Brandon! Yeah Brandon showed up.
Amanda: Brandon would not go through a door with a sign on it.
Brandon: That's a good point that's a good point.
Julia: Do I recognize the voice?
Eric: Yeah that is a voice you recognize that is uh one that takes you all the way back to when you were eight years old, and uh someone who that gets you both a Barbie Dream House and a very very large Hot Wheels track and that is only connected to your aunt Minerva last seen roaming around in the Baltics looking for toad legs as your as your as your mom would call them.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Dom then immediately stiffens up like tries to smooth out his short sleeve button down and wipe the flour off of his pants he says
Eric (as Dom 5): Oh uh you know uh Aunt Min, I wasn't uh I wasn't anticipating you to come so uh so on time.
Eric (as Aunt Min): [With a clear, almost posh voice] When I was studying with the gurus in the deep rocky mountains, I knew that time is all we really have. And then I said but we also have our things and they kicked me out.
[Brandon and Julia laughing]
Eric: Val you walk out and your Aunt Min—
Julia: Val doesn't even like walk out at first, Val just laughs.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Dom you have company?
Eric (as Dom 5): Oh you know it's just uh you don't— you know I don't want to wait—
Julia: Val just pokes their head out and be like
Julia (as Val): Sup Aunt Min?
Eric: So your Aunt Min to me she looks like Angelica Houston now. Like broad face and incredibly like severe bangs, but someone that you've looked at and be like “oh you've been beautiful your entire life, and this is just like another form of you being beautiful” like she was beautiful in the 70’s and she's like a different type of beautiful now. One that has like layers on it it's like those places where you put wallpaper just over and over and over again, but every single wallpaper is like gorgeous and $500 a roll.
Julia: Yeah that's just the general vibe of the Marconi family I feel like.
Eric: Yeah absolutely, she has a scar that runs from her shoulder to her elbow on her right arm, right now she's wearing kind of just like a simple black dress. But there is a massive shawl like one that covers at least 33% of her body at all times, the color of good red wine that's just like shifting and moving and you can never really see her hands because it's always covered in the shawl. And it it's cold it's December and like she's only wearing a dress and a shawl.
Julia: Big vibe when she sees you it's like our storm cloud passes over her face for a moment like what Dom has another proof there's somebody else here, and then she recognizes it's you and says
Eric (as Aunt Min): VAL! [Beat of silence] Oh come on, come here, come here, come here, come here!!
Eric: And she just opens her arms up to you.
Julia: Big old hug!
Eric: She like grabs you by the shoulders be like
Eric (as Aunt Min): Oh you've— you look so big you're so strong, oh who are you— who are you punching? Who who's getting the other other side of these fists? Like come on!
Julia (as Val): Everyone who deserves it, you know how it goes.
Eric (as Aunt Min): That's— I do actually absolutely know how it goes! Absolutely, absolutely oh it's so good to see you!
Eric: At this point Dom’s just like
Eric (as Dom 5): Uh and can I get you anything can I get you anything do you uh uh do you want the uh—
Julia (as Val): The woman asked for some pies, Dom you could give her some pies.
Eric (as Dom 5): Uh yeah I'll just start working on some pies.
Eric: And Dom dumb runs to the back there's no kitchen to the back.
Julia (as Val): That's uh, okay that was his office.
Eric: Aunt Min pulls a table to the middle of the room and pulls up two chairs and offers you to sit down.
Julia: Okay and I do.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Oh Val, is so good to what this is such a wonderful surprise. I couldn't have thought any of the multiverses this, the other one the one that the devil controls, the one that Jesus Christ our lord and savior controls, I wouldn't have been able to think that I would have such a lovely surprise. How are you? Tell me everything!
Julia (as Val): I'm good you didn't know that I'm in Lake Town City like full-time now?
Eric (as Aunt Min): No I did, I just I'm more like the surprise of you being here right now in this moment that we have with each other.
Julia (as Val): I live like right upstairs.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Another surprise!
Julia (as Val): I works here.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Wonderful surprises upon surprises next thing I know Jimmy Hoffa is going to jump out from underneath this table and tell me where he was his entire time.
Julia (as Val): I mean you know who's to say?
Eric (as Aunt Min): Who is truly
Eric: And she grabs your face
Eric (as Aunt Min): Who. Is. To. Say?
Julia (as Val): I mean if anyone could tell us it would probably be you right? Like you'd be able to see it.
Eric (as Aunt Min): If only honestly if only it worked like that. [sighs]
[Beat of silence]
Eric (as Aunt Min): If only…
Julia (as Val): So what are you doing in uh in Lake Town City?
Eric (as Aunt Min): Yeah oh you know the way that the the we follow the winds and sometimes the winds take you in the place you didn't expect. I put my sail up for my sailboat and it took I thought it was gonna take me to New York City but it took me all the way up the Hudson River, and here I am.
Julia (as Val): Is that a metaphor or did you get a boat?
Eric (as Aunt Min): A little bit of both. Sometimes as I learned from the guru at the top of the highest peak in our wonderful state of Oregon. Sometimes a metaphor is just as much not a metaphor. It sounds better in sanskrit, I'm sorry it's the the translation as we said it's not. So what no— I want to know what's how what's going on with you? How are you?
Julia (as Val): I'm you know, I'm good just doing— doing my thing working mostly.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Mhm, and whatever—what are you doing what are your jobs?
Julia (as Val): Well I make pizzas for Dom, I walk dogs every now and again, I do like that I am a person with a van I help people move things, and uh you know Postmates, I do that sometimes.
Eric (as Aunt Min): I don't what is that it is.
Julia (as Val): Like people who are too lazy, or can't leave their apartment they text me and then I pick them up either groceries, or take out food or sometimes condoms.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Mhm, mhm, got it, necessary. That's necessary work if people can't go out and get condoms for themselves, someone needs to provide for them.
Julia (as Val): That's what I'm here for.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Well Val, you seem like so you're so resourceful, and you're so you're so smart, and strong, and kind, and I just I hope that you're finding what makes you happy. You're finding your purpose.
Julia (as Val): Thank you I I think I am!
Eric (as Aunt Min): I you know sometimes you do all these things at once and you think that the sum of these things are going to come together and be one thing, but sometimes they're just little pieces and it's a jigsaw puzzle that doesn't actually come together. So I want you to know that I hope that you have a full puzzle inside of you.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): Okay I—I think I understand that metaphor pretty well, and I think that my puzzle pieces are gonna come into a full picture.
Eric: She then immediately like suddenly grabs your hand and holds onto it very tightly.
Julia (as Val): Hello she looks into like the middle distance and she says
Eric (as Aunt Min): Who's Agatha?
Julia (as Val): I don't know anyone named Agatha. Is that Agatha Christie? Is Agatha Christie trying to contact you because I love her mysteries.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Aunt Min): Huh no, I guess not.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Okay well you know if you need anything I'll just be in Lake Town City for a little while.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Doing Aunt Min things. Uh Val if you could be such a sweet porcelain doll found inside of a treasure chest buried at the bottom of all of the seven seas, if you could just go get Dominic for a moment and uh we have some
[Beat of silence]
Eric (as Aunt Min): Intimate things we have to discuss.
Julia (as Val): Sure.
Brandon: Gross.
Julia (as Val): That's— that's fine, sounds good I'm gonna go get him.
Eric (as Aunt Min): Thank you.
Julia: I get up from the table, and I go to the back to Dom’s office being like
Julia (as Val): There's no pizza here.
Eric: Dom is just like going through papers and like pulling a manila folder together he's like
Eric (as Dom 5): Oh yeah, yeah, yeah don't it's fine, uh yeah yeah I'll tell you I'll take care of it sure yeah.
Julia (as Val): Hey Dom?
Eric (as Dom 5): Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah?
Julia (as Val): You remember the chair?
[Beat of silence]
Eric (as Dom 5): Whe— yeah yeah the chair.
Julia (as Val): You remember the money that I took to pay for the chair?
Eric (as Dom 5): Uh-huh.
Julia (as Val): You remember the suitcase that the money was in?
Eric (as Dom 5): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): Remember me giving it to the guy even though it was uh attached to my wrist via handcuff?
Eric (as Dom 5): Mhm?
Julia (as Val): You know he had to open that bag in front of me right?
Eric (as Dom 5): Mhm.
Julia (as Val): And obviously you put what was in that bag into that bag.
Eric (as Dom 5): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): I want to know where that came from.
Eric: He just stands there for a moment like he doesn't know what to say. His mouth is literally open and then you see he's looking over your shoulder and Aunt Min is standing behind you and walked up like a jungle cat. And you see that she's holding an onion in each one of her hands, and she gives one to you Val and she says
Eric (as Aunt Min): You know in france you can determine how much snow is going to fall that winter by looking at the thickness of the onion skin.
Eric: And she pulls like what can only be described as a to-go butcher's knife—
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Eric: Out of her pocket she throws the onion in the air and just slices it in half and she shows it to you and she like points out the skin on the outer rim and on the inner rim and she says
Eric (as Aunt Min): This is pretty thick. Snow's coming a lot of snow this year. Val I have to talk to Dom.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric (as Aunt Min): We'll talk soon.
Julia (as Val): Have a nice night!
[Transition note]
Eric: Hey it's Eric can I talk about the cold weather for a second? Now there are many people out there who get sweaty at the first sight of heat rolling towards them, and I am one of those people. It's like I try to explain this to people like my brain is an old computer. If you run too many things on it gets hot, and then you know it has to give some of its ram over from computing power to just running the fan, and then the fan goes like waaaah! It's super loud and the computer doesn't run nearly as well. That's like my brain when it's hot out like 40% of my brain is devoted to running the fan inside of myself, and trying to find air conditioning as soon as possible, so it's cold I finally feel like my full self is engaged and I'm like a real person. Welcome to the midroll take out all your sweatshirts y'all it's fall!

Eric: So Milo after a long night of you barking at squirrels
Brandon: Okay hold on, I'm gonna stop you there. I speak dog I am not a dog.
Eric: I'm joking!
Brandon: I did bark at Tuna just to like annoy them
Eric: And then Tuna's like
Eric (as Tuna): I understand you.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: the next morning you wake up and you look at yourself in your bathroom mirror and the ghost hand is no longer covering your mouth.
Brandon: Oh thank god!
Eric: Uh so yeah you head over to your dad's office uh where is it and what do you what does it look like?
Brandon: They try to keep it sort of low-key obviously, because it's not necessarily something that's acknowledged. It's probably like on the very very edge of College Park it's like in the nice district like where maybe the professors live. And it looks like uh sort of just like a non-descript building, like if you passed it without knowing what it is like you probably you might not know what it actually is but obviously everyone in the town is like “oh yeah that you mean this building yeah!”
Eric: Yeah no I don't really know what's in it I thought it was gonna be an Old Navy for a little while but I guess not.
[Eric and Brandon laugh]
Brandon: They do have like a couple of like just hanging pants outside just to confuse people.
Eric: Just to confuse people. It just says “sale!” But it doesn't say what the sale is for, yeah. But you go inside and I guess like you take the secret elevator or not the real elevator that goes down, and you're now in the office of Technology Assessment on the wall is like kind of the you know the U.S. seal but instead of holding like vines and arrows it's holding a magnifying glass at an ethernet cord.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: I think it's like pretty open plan like desks like imagine it was like a 1960s ad agency, but instead it's also like an open plan it's like someone just pulled out all the walls. So your dad's sitting at just like this really nice desk and some like old like really brown and like cushy leather chair, but you can see him like from 100 feet away, and he's seen—
Brandon: That’s the worst of both worlds!
Eric: Truly truly and he gets up he's like
Eric (as Hank): Milo!!!
Eric: And he runs over and gives you a big hug.
Brandon: Yeah and it's a good hug!
Eric: He says
Eric (as Hank): So I have some intel
Eric: And he pulls you in close and he says
Eric (as Hank): There's a new Vietnamese place nearby and I think we should hit it up.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh is it is it like a money money laundering scheme or?
Eric (as Hank): I mean we can pretend it is but I think that it's a good deal.
Julia: No, it's just delicious.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay I'm down! I'm down, let's go! Okay!
Eric: Your dad gets you both bahn mis but instead of chicken pate it's like guacamole. Like really good guacamole okay.
Brandon: Milo takes a bite he's like
Brandon (as Milo): I'm not sure about this one.
Eric: Your dad is like halfway done with his he's like
Eric (as Hank): It seems pretty good! I think it's great to me!
Eric: Your dad then says
Eric (as Hank): Uh Milo where is the winter coat that I got you? It is so cold!
Brandon (as Milo): Is it?I guess I didn't really— it didn't really feel that cool to me that's weird.
Eric: Your dad takes a hat out of his pocket and holds it up to you.
Amanda: Awww peak dad.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks.
Brandon: Is it like a beanie hat?
Eric: Yeah it's a beanie and it has like the Office of Technology Assessment like seal on the front/
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks dad and I put it next to my spring rolls.
Eric (as Hank): Milo you know for a fact that's not what hats are for.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Eric (as Hank): I will send you the scientific the scientific studies that say what hats are for.
Brandon (as Milo): Can you? That would be delightful.
Eric (as Hank): They keep your brain in. Literally.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh crap.
Brandon: And then Milo puts the hat on quickly.
Eric (as Hank): Yh yeah so hey so well yeah what's going on? How's uh how's MMFFC? How's everything what's going on you know things are good generally Lucas says hi.
Eric (as Hank): Oh nice!
Brandon (as Milo): He wanted me to to do your secret handshake that you two apparently have, which I'm pretty sure was just him like trying to screw with me, but I you— know I don't know whether or not that's true so.
Eric (as Hank): Oh Old Lucas Skywalker yeah absolutely!
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Eric: And then he does it like in the air and it's intricate like hand movements, and then there's a lightsaber portion.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh great so that is real um—
Eric (as Hank): But don't worry Milo, Milo yeah I'm your father.
Brandon (as Milo): That's true thank you.
Eric (as Hank): It was a reference to the Star Wars movie.
Brandon (as Milo): Right, the emphasis was wrong so I didn't catch it.
Eric (as Hank): Sorry.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh that's okay uh you know it works good, um yeah I've been you know I've been sick a few days, so I've been having to call in a few days. But really what I wanted to um ask you about well— I just want to have lunch with you because you know you pick the best places dad—
Eric (as Hank): Thank you it's all I really want to hear! It's—it's so you know you spend so much time raising a son to grow up to be such an upstanding member of society, but all you really want, all parents really want is the affirmation that the small things they do matter so thank you Milo!
Eric: He's already finished the other half of the banh mi.
Brandon: And Milo sort of like slides the thai iced tea away from his dad because clearly he's had too much caffeine.
Brandon (as Milo): It's actually funny that you asked about work though I I came across a thing um that came in like a new artifact came in I want to ask you about if see if you had anything about it.
Eric (as Hank): Oh yeah?
Brandon (as Milo): There was this like uh it was really cool it was like this big um sort of like science tomb?
Eric (as Hank): OH!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I'm pretty sure— we're pretty sure it came from like Dr. Morrow’s lab like we put in Dr. Morrow's exhibit so I from what we think what we've like unearthed is like it was an experiment she's she was working on. But um there was potentially some like covered up let's say accidents if you know what I mean?
Eric: Yeah your dad is like in full “thinking about this” mode he has his eyebrows— I feel like he has really bushy dad eyebrows, they're like so furrowed right now
Brandon (as Milo): And you I mean you know I love Dr. Morrow, I've been liking Dr. Morrow since I was you know six. So you know it's hard for me to think about anything negative about her, but like it's made me really wonder like what's the real story on the doctor? Is there stuff she's hiding? Are people getting hurt around her experiments? Do you know anything like that?
Eric (as Hank): I don't have anything off the top of my head I mean I can look into it but Dr. Morrow I mean she's I can't imagine. I mean, I know she's in power and everything and you know power corrupts absolutely, and everything that's the entire basis of my job with the doctor. I mean she's she has a good head on her shoulders she looks out for everybody, I mean I wouldn't have this job without her she created the office OTA. So I just I'm not saying you're not right, I just I I can't believe that she would be involved I can't imagine she would be involved in any of that. Or if I mean that maybe it's just not the whole story. I mean science tombs— it seems—
Brandon: Oh can I roll an insight check?
Eric: Sure!
Julia: On your dad?? On your dad, Brandon?!
Brandon: This is Brandon doing it, Milo would never roll an insight check on his dad.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 7 +7 for 14.
Eric: Okay with a 14 ask a probing question, and I'll answer truthfully.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, yeah yeah, I assume dispatch I mean we've—we've read all the biographies on her, but like I think I would think if anyone around town would you know be aware of any you know like rumors, maybe like there's some like whispers around the building that like people are scared to talk about, is there anything along those lines of—you know there is any reason that like I shouldn't trust her? As as as like a citizen of course, you know.
Eric (as Hank): No I mean no I don't I don't think you shouldn't trust her. She's great I mean we don't have anything on her at all. Like it would be I guess it would be kind of strange if an office that she made would investigate things on her. But like I haven't— I haven't seen but you know I haven't seen anything. There's nothing I guess? For the sake of rigor and data there should be but I guess there's there's not. Huh. I don't know I don't but like that could mean anything that could be there is nothing or there is the occam's razor version of this is that there is nothing because there is nothing. But right you know.
Brandon: Milo pulls out his phone and shows uh his dad the photo of the science tomb which is now the official name it's capital S capital T trademark.
Brandon (as Milo): Would you be able to like look this up in the database? Like is there any you know, or maybe ask around?
Eric (as Hank): You know that's funny you know what this looks like this looks like um— there was like an old run of like weird science comics in the 70’s and 80’s and there you know whenever they had something where they were turning human into not a human you know like part human-part fly, part human-part dog, how part human-part dinosaur. Always kind of look like this.
Brandon (as Milo): Part human part dog?! That's wild why would anyone— that would be weird.
Eric (as Hank): Do you uh you're you know hey do you ever run into Dr. Morrow at the at the the MMFFC?
Brandon (as Milo): No she doesn't like not at the museum like she doesn't uh—it's like it would be like uh Paul McCartney coming to the Paul McCartney exhibit.
Eric (as Hank): Sure yeah yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Like it's just kind of lame I've seen that it's we it was weird he was like “oh bruv! Look at all me songs!” And everyone was like “what”
Brandon (as Milo): Oh no she obviously came to the dedication, with sure for like all of four seconds cut the ribbon, and left and I'm you know I've run into her on the street once or twice but no.
Eric (as Hank): Oh wow yeah, you know I know we you've been to some some dinner parties before I mean if you want to talk to her, I can introduce you.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah that'd be great!
Eric (as Hank): Sure yeah yeah! I'll get that together! Okay alright um but yeah Milo look into this.
Brandon (as Milo): Um maybe don't mention the death thing. I mean the accident thing.
Eric (as Hanl): Sure.
Brandon: And Milo looks around the restaurant.
Eric (as Hank): Right uh yeah yeah, no but yeah no that's fine. I think at this point Tuna pops up on your shoulder Milo and he's like
Eric (as Tuna): Daddy!!! Daddy hellooooo!
Eric: Tuna is going to make a jump at your dad.
Brandon: Uh yeah I quickly cast hold person and keep Tuna on my shoulder.
Eric: Oh my god what's the spell save on that?
Brandon: 15.
Julia: Alright come on, Tuna come on!
Eric: Beans I rolled a 2. Oh can you do a spirit surge for me my friend?
Brandon: Yeah!
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Yeah 10!
Eric: Oh okay, you're fine yeah but I will up my number by 1. Yeah Tuna like tries to do a leap from your shoulder to your dad's shoulder and then the ghost hand comes out of your chest and grabs Tuna out of the air, so there's just the ghost hand is holding Tuna as Tuna's doing like the cat thing they're like [angry cat noises] and your dad just like
Eric (as Hank): Yeah so they they really gotta change the coffee maker it's starting to taste really bad.
Brandon: And I just take a long sip of my thai iced tea.
Eric: [Laughing] Alright scene!
[Transition note]
Eric: Allright let's do Aggie and Emily Slaughter! So um like a block down the street from this really really new condominium is this juice bar a juice bar/matcha bar that's called JUICE!
Brandon: Jesus.
Julia: Right.
Amanda: I think when Aggie wakes up that morning, she'll text Val to confirm and say you know if you could just be around the block from or something that would be super helpful.
Julia: There's like a dog park probably like down the block from it or something like that.
Eric: For sure, for sure.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I do like the idea that you're gonna grab all the dogs and run over.
Brandon: Don't, don't let the dogs get into the fight.
Amanda: They’re in a dog park, they’re safe!
Brandon: Must protecc.
Amanda: They’re able to roam on their own if they needed to.
Julia: Exactly, I'll probably take Moxie because she's the smallest, and all the other dogs are gonna pick on her if I leave them.
Eric: Fair, fair. Okay so yeah Val you're within you're definitely within range and you're with the dogs. Aggie tell me what it's like for you to show up?
Amanda: Yeah I will drive across town begrudgingly. I hate coming over here, and I have not been to Thornhill in ages, and I haven't been this far outside historic Lake Town since the warehouse incident as I refer to it in my brain. So I will grumble and parallel park on the street after circling a couple of times, and be in the juice bar a few minutes before noon.
[Upbeat lighthearted pop starts playing]
Eric: Yeah as you walk in there's somebody standing like right inside the door that's like
Eric (as Greeter): Welcome to JUICE! Would you like to try this blueberry concoction?
Amanda: Aggie holds up her hand.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm not going to purchase anything, but my companion will.
Eric (as Greeter): Okay that's a weird way to talk to someone who works in an economic establishment but alright.
Amanda (as Aggie): Do you have a small black coffee, nothing else in it, no boosters or whatever?
Eric (as Greeter): Uh why would we have that caffeine sludge in JUICE!
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay how about a do you have environmentally friendly bottled water?
Eric (as Greeter): Absolutely ma'am! You can just order at the front, I'm just here to give you blueberry concoction!
Eric: And they're holding up like little tray of the little cups that have like a dark disturbingly navy blue drink in it.
Amanda (as Aggie): No thank you but I appreciate it.
Eric (as Greeter): Alright! Well if you want uh a new thing that we have on the menu, there is a a delish, there's a delicious new mushroom boost that you gotta try!
Amanda: Aggie is sweating.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh okay I'll think about it.
Eric (as Greeter): [Laughs] Okay so I rolled to see when Emily showed up, and I rolled in at 20. So Emily is already sitting in a table next to the window, and she's holding up a very deep blue navy smoothie, and like a bright yellow smoothie and she's holding them both up to you and she's like
Eric (as Emily): Oh Aggie— over Aggie over here!
Amanda: I give a little shrug to the employee at the door and walk over to the table.
Eric: Emily says
Eric (as Emily): Oh yeah I uh I just I love coming here, I'm just I'm such a regular these these both seem so good to me the blueberry concoction, and I guess this one the the name of it was just “yellow” but it was bold and underlined, so I either one if you want to try it!
Amanda (as Aggie): You are a braver woman than me.
Eric: So she gives you the yellow one.
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you, what do I owe you? I should I have cash or—
Eric (as Emily): Hey Aggie come on between two women in this rough and tumble [whispering] powered [regular voice] business that we're in together come on we need to look out for each other!
Julia: Why are you whispering? You literally told the the newspapers what your name is! Damn you, Emily Slaughter.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: I will push the smoothie gently to the side and put my hands like flat on the table like fold it over each other.
Eric (as Emily): Oh you gotta try— you have to try it it's just gonna bring you all the energy you'll never have to have caffeine again! It will literally make you poisoned to caffeine like it will feel like someone is injecting you with poison if you even drink a latte.
Amanda: Aggie’s shirt’s beginning to get sweat stained.
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen my mother would never forgive me if I uh let food come before an apology, and I just want to say that I'm sorry that I didn't get back to you and you know whatever real excuses there were you know you made a real effort, and you reached out and I hope that you don't think badly of me, and I just wanted to you know say that uh first.
[Beat of silence]
Eric (as Emily): [Sighs then inhales] Thank you I really appreciate that. There is— you didn't really even have to apologize. I mean what it's it's silly it's really silly you just don't— you don't have to. But thank you, I accept your apology.
Amanda (as Aggie): Good I mean I want to know how things are going like what are you guys up to? I've seen the press that's like wow!
Eric (as Emily): Oh my god you saw that wow thank you so much I think that we're just doing a really good thing for the Upcountry Keepers, and I feel like we we're trying to really just make the city a better place, and if people won't come together, and you know fight for what's right and use their powers for good, that's just really what we're doing here and something that we're communicating with. And like you know the police chief, it really happened when they got that commendation, and the mayor really loves it, and I think that it's really good. Thank you!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah no I mean like how are how are you guys working with all those other agencies? That seemed overwhelming to me, kind of the idea of like doing something alongside what other agencies are already doing? You know me I'm just like a government employee, and you know rank and file is definitely the the name of the game.
Eric (as Emily): Oh my god, don't ever apologize for not knowing something I just like I am so happy to tell you.
Amanda: Aggie’s knuckles flex.
Eric (as Emily): Yeah no, I mean we're just over coordinating with everybody they give us some tips, and they point us in the direction I mean we do a lot of our own kind of rounds, and everything. But I think that they're just happy to have us around and will put us in the place that we need to. Like they see us as an extension of them, and that we just want people to believe in us and honestly that's that's all we can really ask for.
Amanda (as Aggie): No for sure has anyone have like reporters trying to get in touch like I don't know like Average Bear or something?
Eric (as Emily): Oh I mean— oh my god I didn't even ask you, like what is going on with your family? I didn't even know they were going to ask you about— I didn't even know they were going to put you in the same article that you know that Average Bear article.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah no. You may guess that it makes me kind of uncomfortable and I um you know, I don't want that kind of attention, my siblings have their own thing, and my parents and I just I'm I'm different than them. You know and so to see our name in print like that was was kind of a nightmare. And it's—it kind of threw me.
Eric (as Emily): Stop right there. Aggie the things that you're doing are so important. They're honestly the most important, and the fact that you're putting yourself—just because like you're one of your siblings uh it knows Kacey Musgraves, and another one like had won a bunch of X Game medals, like what you're doing is so incredibly important and the fact that you're putting yourself down like that it just it actually like it's as if I was drinking coffee right now. it's it's literal poison in my body.
Amanda (as Aggie): Wow I I'm sorry I suggested Mountain Brews, I didn't— I didn't know your stance on coffee—
Eric (as Emily): No. I know I love coffee. It's just like now it's just like in Hamlet, someone poured poison into my ear, and then I expire, and someone should just take me off someone just take me off to a nunnery right now like come on.
Amanda (as Aggie): You do seem more energetic than any coffee drinker I've ever met.
Eric (as Emily): Thank you, you know it's that honestly, that boost— like you just gotta get those boosts it's the the mushroom boost they have here is so good it's like honestly they called it truffle boost but I don't know if it's truffle boost, so I think they just settled on mushrooms. I told them if it's not actually truffle they're gonna—
Brandon: Aggie, blow up the building, blow up the building! Get out!
Julia: Yeah it's bad! Get out of there!
Amanda (as Aggie): You know could you could you ask them about the mushrooms? Because I would love to suggest that same supplier for Mountain Brews. Do you know, do you know where they get them from?
Eric (as Emily): Oh no I don't. Listen, you don't want to ruin the magic.
Eric: Val make a perception check for me?
Julia: Oh god yeah.
Eric: Aggie you too.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: 5.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 8, can I use a luck point? I mean it's been— I've had a long rest, right?
Eric: Yeah you can use a luck point.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: Oh yeah 18!
Eric: Yeah Val no you're good, Moxie and Rufus are really getting at it, so like you got to separate them.
Julia: Alright I gotta write down Rufus on my list of dogs.
Eric: Aggie for a moment you're just like trying to stay present while Emily is talking at your face, and for a moment you see like a really big bird just like flew by above the window, and like you can see like the shadow of something like flying by just kind of cast down, really quickly though.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know what I I think I might have forgotten to feed the meter, Emily thanks so much for meeting me, I just, I'm glad we could clear the air, and like I hope you know that you know you have my number, and my phone is everything is fixed and stuff now. But if you need me you know I'm here, and I hope the same goes for goes for you!
Eric (as Emily): Yeah absolutely!
Eric: I feel like as you're getting up, she like grabs your hand and like pulls you back down for a little bit. It's like now you're like half seated half standing she's
Eric (as Emily): Like you know I really um I'm so glad that us talking was so great, and I just wanted to talk to— I'm like I know that you're close with Val and Milo. But you know we're still looking for a fourth for the Upcountry Keepers. And I think you would be amazing. We need someone who has that combination of both raw athletic power and like healing and support, so I just want to I want to put that on the table before you go.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'll take it under advisement, thank you.
Eric (as Emily): Okay because you know us [whispering] powered [regular voice] girls need to stick together.
Amanda (as Aggie): Definitely.
Amanda: And I take the yellow smoothie very gingerly, and rush outside toward where my car is parked.
[Pop music fades]
Eric: Yeah I think as you look up you see the shadow is gone, make another perception check I want to see, I'll make another here
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 18.
[Traffic noises]
Eric: You can see standing on top of the building Sour Anthony is holding like a digital camera.
Amanda: I flip him off.
Eric: And he looks up and he's like
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey fuck you man!
Eric: He flips you off back.
Amanda: I flip him off with my other hand.
Eric: He flies like five feet in the air and flips you off with both, and then he drops the digital camera, and he's like AH! and he dives down.
Amanda: I text Val
Amanda (as Aggie): Sour Anthony's around so beware, do you need a lift back to Little Italy?
Julia (as Val): No I gotta walk the dogs unless you want the dogs in your truck.
Amanda (as Aggie): No I think that would be too cute and I just wouldn't get anything done, thanks for being back up, and just watch watch your back on the way home.
Eric: Artists please give us fan art of Val and Aggie and dogs in her truck, thank you! And all of the dogs look different!
Julia: Yes there's— hold on I'll list off the types of dogs that we have.
Amanda: Moxie’s in the cab with us.
Julia: there's Bruiser the burmese mountain dog, there's Charlotte giant poodle, there's Moxie the golden retriever puppy, and there's Rufus who's a bulldog.
Amanda: Adorable!
Eric: Amazing Val and Aggie can you both make nature checks for me?
[Dice rolls]
Amadna: Got a 6 so I'm gonna re-roll.
Julia: Oh I got a 17 -1 for a 16 bruh!
Amanda: 8.
Eric: Aggie you're good, Val later that night when you're making dinner. I assume there's something with onion, um you pick up an onion and you look at it again and you're like wow these skins are really thick.
Amanda: Oh boy.
[Transition note]
Eric: Later that night you three get a group text from an unknown number and it says
Eric (as texter): Hey, it’s Dez, you guys home?
Julia: Yes!
Amanda: Yeah!
Brandon: Hi!!
Eric: Wonderful Aggie you hear a loud engine vrooom and you look outside and Dez is a stride like a 1940’s style motorcycle like an army issue with like a sidecar, and in the sidecar there's a big sack of stuff.
Amanda: I uh head outside to greet him.
Julia: Dez is tech Santa Claus.
Eric (as Dez): Oh yeah, yeah I was just um I got finished with some stuff. But I wanted to bring over there, so.
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you! Did you want any I have like leftovers? It's just Greek take out, but I mean it's really good.
Eric (as Dez): Well I uh— I only eat once a day and I eat like—I have my own thing.
Amanda (as Aggie): Respect.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah I think, so yeah just uh hey check this out.
Eric: He holds out something to you that looks like just an aerosol spray can and it says preserver on the side.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh amazing! What is this?
Eric (as Dez): Yeah so yeah, like don't—I can't really tell you like how it works or anything but uh, I think what are you saying about neutralizing, and stuff uh this will definitely help you with that.
Amanda (as Aggie): Amazing, thank you!
Eric: So Amanda this is neutralizing spray uh you can cast counterspell once a session.
[Julia gasps]
Julia: That's very good!!
Eric: You can also use ki points to juice it as you would with counter spell instead of using spell slots, so ordinarily you have to like roll a DC and all that stuff but you can use a ki point to automatically like wipe it. Also for all you d&d nerds out there don't worry I will be sure Amanda can in fact counter spell abilities.
Amanda: What is the range?
Eric: 60 feet. So it's like this is like bear mace, it's like if you spray it at them, or you can spray it at the spell or whatever and you'll be able to like neutralize it in the air.
Amanda: Very cool you should not get closer than 60 feet to a bear anyway so that makes sense.
Brandon: Very importantly, this is not a true aerosol there's no CFCs correct?
Eric: Oh no it's just like it looks like—
Amanda: Super environmentally friendly.
Eric (as Dez): It looks like a yeah so uh I mean, it's really just like air if you just push the air as hard as possible through this thing, it's all I can't really get in— don't worry about it.
Amanda (as Aggie): It's like electrical fields.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah it's like it's electrons.
Eric: And Dez smiles as he says it's like electrons.
Amanda (as Aggie): Thanks man and if you if you're in the neighborhood, you know you're welcome to stop by!
Eric (as Dez): Oh yeah thanks I appreciate it. Um okay.
Amanda: Bye awkwardly.
Eric: Not and yeah uh alright yeah and he pulls up in front of— so Val I don't know what you're expecting but outside you hear the revving, Val sticks their head out their window you look down and you see Dez on the motorcycle just waving to you and holding the sack out from the sidecar.
Julia: Cool Val's gonna like just jump down the fire escape.
Brandon: Nice!
Eric: Make a perception check.
Julia: Perception uhhh
[Dice rolling]
Julia: 7.
Eric: Hey the lights are off in Dominic's so I guess whoever was in there is gone.
Julia: Yeah that's usually how that works just because the lights are off.
Eric: Yeah so Dez is outside and says
Eric (as Dez): Hey uh Val I've been working on some stuff if you want to check it out.
Julia (as Val): Hell yeah man let's see it!!
Eric: Uh Julia do you know like what a Nintendo Power Glove looks like?
Julia: No but I'm gonna google it real quick!
Eric: Hold on yeah so for those who don't know the Nintendo Power Glove is a real thing that Nintendo used to sell it was an accessory for the NES, and it's like it's like you put on a baseball batting glove but then attached to it is a keyboard, and it looks very silly. But what he holds out to you they really look powerful they're like gauntlets, there's some padding there to protect your hand, and also there seems to be some sort of just like mechanical stuff attached here.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So he says like
Eric (as Dez): Yeah so when you put this on it kind of takes your thing when you know you're vibrating everything, it converts that from moving energy into like actual energy and just like uh yeah I mean it's pretty— I think it's pretty cool.
Julia (as Val): That sounds really cool!
Eric: So these are volcano gauntlets.
Julia: Oh hell yeah, hold on so writing that down.
Eric: You can add an additional 1d6 fire damage to all physical attacks both your punches, and your spikes.
Julia: Oh that is very cool!
Eric: And Dez then tells you to hop into the side car, and drives you over to an abandoned lot like a few blocks away. He's like hey just like uh
Eric (as Dez): Look at a point like pretty far away from here.
Julia (as Val): Okay!
Julia: So I focus on like I don't know there's like a tire or something halfway into the lot.
Eric: You focus on it and then like a really small volcano plums out of the ground and like goes [blows raspberry] and like shoots lava everywhere and just like melts this tire.
Julia: That is extremely cool!
Eric: Dez like picks up a bottle that's on the ground and is like
Eric (as Dez): Hey uh focus on this.
Eric: And he throws it in the air, so then you it's like you move the volcano over like 10 feet, and then it shoots lava in the air and hits the bottle.
Julia: Oh that's extremely cool.
Eric: So mechanically you can cast create bonfire as an action once a day.
Julia: Okay great!
Eric: And since you're over fifth level it all it starts by doing 2d8, however if a creature or a thing you want to hit is 30 feet or less above the bonfire, ordinarily you just run it's a literal bonfire and you just run over it, but this is a volcano and it shoots lava into the air you can hit it out of the air.
Julia: Incredible!
Eric (as Dez): So uh can you you can like walk home or anything? I still got one more thing that I gotta do.
Julia (as Val): Yeah I mean I was gonna as a thank you I was gonna give you a tray of manigot so if you want to drop me off, I can give you the manigot but like—
Eric (as Dez): No, I eat once a day so.
Julia (as Val): You know it's already frozen so you just eat it whenever you want.
Eric (as Dez): Okay fine.
Eric: And he drives over to your apartment, and he takes it. Alright Milo you hear the same thing outside of your window [Eric makes revving noises]
Brandon: And Milo just assumes it's a motorcycle!
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: You got a text!
Eric: You get a text and it's Dez's face just blank expression looking at you
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Terrifying uh I walk out my apartment, and uh walk up Dez, and I say
Brandon (as Milo): Dez like you can just say “hey I'm outside” and do you have to send me a weird sketchy selfie.
Eric (as Dez): I mean okay… Fine. Uh hey I got something for you
Brandon (as Milo): Wait I got something for you come upstairs!
Eric (as Dez): I have to the I mean can you get it and bring it back down? I gotta watch the thing here.
Brandon (as Milo): Actually that might be better, okay!
Brandon: So then Milo runs upstairs, and Dez sees like the front door open again, and nothing comes out but then you look down and there's like a two maybe one and a half two foot little model of the alien from Alien like animated walking towards Dez. And Milo runs out and is like
Brandon (as Milo): Look what I did!!
Julia: Horrifying.
Eric (as Dez): I admit, that's pretty cool like where, how did you get it to move? Was it ghost— ghost things?
Brandon (as Milo): it's ghost things.
Eric (as Dez): Oh hell yeah that's actually probably for the best, I was gonna ask you about that.
Eric: And Dez holds out to you two like black-black orbs that are about the size of bocce balls. They fit in your hand but it's a little bit spilling out. I don't know if this is like vanta black or there's something else that's sucking all the light but when you look at it it's just like dark.
Eric (as Dez): So uh hey can you run your uh your ghost stuff in here? There's like a thing there's like a little engine inside of it but I calibrate it to like be able to run on any sort of energy.
Brandon (as Milo): Sure yeah I'll give it I'll give it a shot cool I hold them and stare intensely at them and then hope for the best.
Eric: Yeah I think that you after you stare intensely at them, they then start to float up and then they start circling you in a slow orbit.
Brandon (as Milo): This. Is. Awesome. I'm a planet!
Eric (as Dez): I mean do you want me to tell you what else they do, or are you just going to—
Brandon (as Milo): Oh this is— there's more?!
Eric (as Dez): Yeah no there's more. So uh can you make them hit each other?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah!
Brandon: So Milo speeds one of them up a little bit more than the other one.
Eric: Yes then there's a very sudden look at this a space explosion is different than a regular explosion, you know like on earth we because of the way combustion works it's all fire and like red orange yellow just like bursting out in a burst. But a space explosion is like one is up and one is down because of the way there's like no gravity and everything so which one it just like moves, and it's like orange and purple and and white and blue,
Brandon: And there's no sound most importantly.
Eric: No there is no sound, it's just this and then nothing happens, you're just kind of standing there. And then you see Dez pick up a broken bottle on the ground and just hucks it at you.
Brandon (as Milo): AHHH WHAT DO- Dez!
Eric: And the bottle just passes through you and crashes into the wall behind you.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh. My. God.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Am I invincible forever now!?
Eric (as Dez): It's— it's not forever. The engines are only able to hold it for a few seconds, but I think if you don't tell someone that you stuff can throw through you, it will be best for you.
Brandon (as Milo): That's awesome thank you Dez this is so cool!
Eric (as Dez): Yeah uh listen—
Brandon (as Milo): I know I don't understand your genius, but you should be getting a nobel prize.
Eric (as Dez): Honestly I don't understand how these work, so like let's just hope for the best. The doctor said it was electrons, I don't know.
Julia: It's all electrons.
Brandon (as Milo): I have some um just like leftover um uh thai food upstairs if you want some some food.
Eric (as Dez): Oh no I—I
[Eric bursts into laughter]
Eric (as Dez): No, it's just no I just eat—
[Eric starts laughing again]
Eric: Fuck you!!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric (as Dez): No I only once a day, and this was like my own thing.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay that's fine um yeah alright thanks for coming by!
Eric (as Dez): Hey I'll see you tomorrow.
Brandon (as Milo): Great!
Eric (as Dez): Okay bye.
Brandon (as Milo): Bye!
Eric (as Dez): See ya.
Eric: And Dez uh speeds off into the night.
[Transition note]
Eric: The next morning you three get a text from Dr. Morrow and she says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Hey uh listen, I set up a new program in the Fun Danger Zone Little Gym Explosion! Y'all come by, let's take care of it today!
Julia (as Val): Alright.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay yeah seems like you didn't have to type out the full name of the thing in the text, you could have just abbreviated it.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I’m still working on it.
Eric: I want every one of you to make either a survival or a nature check.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Survival and I rolled a 15.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: I'm gonna use my last luck point.
Brandon: I did survival and I got a 12 +3 for 15.
Amanda: Got the same role twice uh survival is an 11.
Eric: Okay so all of you make a survival check, I think you all check your phones and check out your respective weather apps. I don't know which ones you have, and I'm sure it's finicky. I'm sure Milo you have a very specific one that you and your dad has rigged up to be exactly with the NOAA system.
Brandon: Absolutely.
Eric: You guys all get a check that says it's gonna be super cold today, and even for upstate New York Lake Town City stuff there is going it's gonna be super cold, and there might be some snow later tonight.
Amanda: Ominous.
Brandon: Beautiful.
Eric: Other than Milo, you and Val and Aggie have those apps that tell you like what to dress in it's like “hey make sure to wear boots, and a hat, and a scarf!”
Amanda: I've customized it so that it has pictures of all my flannels and their various weights.
Julia: It's very cute.
Eric: This is like the coldest day that you've had in this winter so far and in upstate New York honestly like there are two seasons there's July and there's winter so you've all done this before but put on your gloves it's gonna be a cold one.

Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to the afterparty for our new arc Join Me Outside numbers 11 and 12!
Julia: Woo hoo hoo!
Eric: Yay! Catch me outside, how about that?
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: How about that? Join me outside, how about that!
Brandon: How about that:
Amanda: Lots to talk about! Lots of very good questions about our characters, and the worlds, but I think we should start probably with the new mechanic that was introduced in these two episodes. Eric tell us a little bit about the fame modifier.
Eric: Yeah absolutely! I think this is something that we discussed all the way back when we first started putting together these episodes. In the introductory stuff I wanted there to be like social ramifications because things happen outside of the telling of this particular story, and I thought it was interesting to kind of incorporate some of that, and I realized because I was too busy giving you all origin stories, and creating you into freaking people, and giving you likes and dislikes—
Brandon: How dare you!
Eric: And giving you families and shit, that I didn't get a chance to put this in to the game yet so I wanted to kick it off with a bang. I also pulled some storytelling ideas from powered by the apocalypse systems, that when you roll skills with that and it's a it's a d6 system, so you might get something from two to twelve, but there's a lot of like success, mixed success, failure states with that. and those aren't just like you fucked up! It's like these things happened, you need to answer these questions. So that was something that I was trying to get at with the failure or the mixed success, the success, and extreme success with those episode 11 and 12 I feel like is when I'm we're really cementing the relationships that you have with the rest of the world, and not just with the main plot here. So introducing someone to for Val to crush on, and their further extended family, Milo's friend group, and really getting into the nitty-gritty of who oh no I can't do this off my off my head Aggie Danny
Amanda: Cassie.
Brandon and Eric: Cassie?
Julia: Kelly.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Kelly Ryan—
Julia: Reagan Ryan Quinn!
Eric: Reagan Ryan Kelly Quinn, uh really diving into those people, and Aggies relationships with them. I feel like we really got to do and then this was like the relationship that you all have with the city considering how you have started fighting crime throughout the fall which is what we did in episode 10. So this was kind of just like the mechanics to put this stuff together, and I really liked how varied everything was. I thought that was wonderful there were ramifications for Milo making a bunch of turkeys dance.
Brandon: Uh, they didn't dance, they fought evil!
Julia: They marched into battle which is somehow worse?
Eric: That's worse.
Amanda: It was really the animation of the turkeys, and not what they did once animated, that was the issue for me.
Julia: It was the dead turkeys running around.
Brandon: I took a second to realize that Tuna was the leader of their organization, so really this is all Tuna’s fault and none of it was Milo—
Eric: No actually surprisingly Milo does things that are bananas, and then they have consequences it's so weird.
Brandon: I don’t think so, I think it was Tuna—
Eric: It’s so— what I think is also interesting is that because of what I rolled on the entanglement table, is that this was related to government secrets being taken by the professor or by the emperor, this also had ramifications in a different way that the government was trying to cover up this bananas thing that Milo instigated, and of course they did a bad job and now it's all over Reddit . Which I found very funny.
Brandon: It was very funny. There's a blooper that I couldn't get in because just because of the way it was edited but uh we took about three minutes figuring out how we could take down Reddit , and it was very funny.
Julia: Yes!
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Aggie's huge on Reddit guys.
Eric: I feel like you said that too Aggie's like really good—
Amanda: It was in the blooper! It didn't make it in! I said that Aggie was was huge in like home renovation diy Reddit.
Brandon: Oh yeah! That was yeah that was the joke, damn it. Yeah there was a it was there was some like editing reason I couldn't get it in there—
Amanda: But that's what the afterparty's for that's— that's why you come!
Brandon: That's true!
Eric: You come so that we can tell you to join our Patreon so that you can get the bloopers.
Amanda: [Laughs] It wasn't designed as a funnel! But you know there you go.
Eric: Now it's a funnel.
Brandon: Join us outside, in our Patreon!
Amanda: I like it.
Eric: Join us outside, listen to the game join us inside we have cookies—
Julia: And hot cocoa!
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Players how did we feel about rolling and needing to narrate our own bad consequences if that's what ya rolled?
Julia: I only rolled good consequences.
Brandon: Wooow okay, Julia!
Amanda: Wooooow.
Brandon: You're out of this conversation then.
Julia: Byyyyeee!
Amanda: Team player there, well I quite liked it yeah. I liked the opportunity to like own the consequence, and to have some say in what happened the sort of example that always comes to mind for me when talking about d&d to new people is to say like oh yeah you know like you say hey I want to jump from roof to roof and then you roll and if you you know get a 20, then you vault over it and no one sees you and it's amazing you make no sound and like you get recruited to a circus,
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: And if you you know roll a 1 then you fall and hurt yourself. But um I like the chance to get a little more detailed than that, and to think about you know from my perspective what would actually be a you know frustrating and potentially dangerous consequence, and it's you know someone that I work with being actively against my interests.
Brandon: I love that you like at your decision-making process it's like you were like “alright what's actually gonna be like really relevant, and good and like gonna make my character have consequences.” And I'm like what would be the funniest bullshit that Milo could get into?
Eric: Some might say that's the differences between each of your playstyle.
Brandon: But yeah no, I loved it too. I especially loved Eric your list of questions, I think they were really great to choose from, and yeah I liked that Milo made a dumbass decision like he always does.
Eric: I think that's worthwhile though, because a lot of the things that and this is also related to Val’s success which I'm going to ask you about, Julia next. Is that sometimes people don't like you for a random reason, or people don't like you for a good reason, and also people like you for a dumb reason, or people like you for like a very relevant reason. So whatever however you answer it is fine because there is a world and a story happening outside of what we're necessarily playing in the main quote-unquote main plot of this game. If you are all out there fighting crime kicking butt. Oh my god the councilman thing is incredible, there was something that I've been really trying to itch at which is people not being excited that this is happening, and I think that we introduced a little bit of that when we were trying to do the story building of like does Dr. Morrow have a mayoral candidate against her? And now we're introducing this in a different way so thank you for creating this person. But it's also like oh I just love this like things just build on each other, it's like the detail, and now we're fleshing it out and now it can touch this in a different way. To Amanda what you said about the rolling of the demand of the d20, honestly I find that this is a flaw in the game d&d is that you say a thing, and then you roll it and then I tell you how well it went or not went. But if you introduce these things that we've talked about is like what are things that you want your players to fill into your world, like what we did with Dr. Morrow's kitchen. It's like well no I want you to answer this question I have come up with the questions, but you should tell me the answer which gives you more agency but then I don't have to do anything and then the world grows because of what you say which is incredible. So now the Astros as Milo loves it so much obviously my this is a relationship between Kilonova and Milo are people gonna notice that Kilonova also has the same favorite Astros as Milo does? And then everything we talked about with Aggie sitting in the city council meetings while the Preserver's out there kicking butt, and then of course now Val. Is Val going to let Vulcani's internet fame go to their head?
Julia: No, probably not.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Okay, oh good! I'm glad we answered that.
Amanda: I'm just glad tumblr's alive and well somewhere.
Brandon: I had to ask Lauren about what all the tumblr shit was when I was editing because I was like “is this funny? Is this good? Like is this a joke? Is this a mistake? I have no idea.”
Julia: Did Lauren say it was good?
Brandon: Yeah of course she did!
Julia: Alright cool just making sure that I got the Lauren Shippen seal of approval.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: I honestly couldn't tell Julia if you were editing yourself or if like the f was like a tumblr thing no.
Julia: It's “f yeah whatever”
Eric: F yes superhero fashion is the new thing yeah. Also this is related to the first one, now I got to write the tweets in the future but that backfills to episode 11. So it's like that was a tease for episode 12 for things I already knew that we had put together, which was a wild thing to do and I think was incredible, and I was really really stoked that I was able to do that.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: All those tweets were extremely good. I just next stop if you haven't listened to it y'all is full of amazing tweets, and texts that Eric writes and Brandon sound designs and it is incredibly fun.
Eric: I had my phone not on silent for the first time in forever. I guess I just like flicked the switch accidentally, and I was texting and I heard the little taps and taps and toots, and I was just like “oh wow that is what it sounds like!” Brandon really nailed that.
Brandon: [Laughing] Taps and toots is the best way to describe that sound.
Eric: Yeah because this is like bop bop bop—
Brandon: I'm gonna go rename my sound effect file right now okay.
Eric: The low sound isn't even a tap anymore, it’s like it's like you're typing on a broken typewriter. It's like click click click click clack bwah.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: So taps and toots.
Amanda: Why don't we get into a couple episode specific questions, and then we have a lot of just really fun kind of general world and character related ones.
Brandon: Sweet!
Julia: Hell yeah!
Amanda: From episode 11 Mia Schloss on instagram would like to know the Sommelier’s weapon coming out of her body why? Also how is she a powered person from the diaphram incident?
Eric: Wonderful, I'm going to answer this a similar way that I answered the other thing, if you haven't watched Static Shock, there was just like the big explosion, and then lots of people who you put into your story now have powers. So the way that diaphram has been distributed and whatever happened around 1983, whatever some people have powers, and we don't necessarily zoom in on their story as we did with our three main characters. They're just like some people have powers now. I think that's the weird thing it's like these children of people who just kind of like looked great for a long period of time, now they have powers Julia I'm gonna throw this to you. Hey Julia can you give some background on the power of having things come out of your body that are weapons?
Julia: Yeah if I remember correctly from the superhero wiki, it's called like “item factory” or like “body factory” and basically you're able to produce items that come out of your body, there's various different like versions of that one you can see in My Hero Academia, which is basically the same power that you described but there's also stuff like Marrow from the X-Men who can pull bones out of her body and use them as weapons, or even someone like Husk from the X-Men who can shed her skin and have a like different form underneath such as like a pure diamond form, or a magma form or something like that.
Brandon: There was a 50/50 chance that when you threw to Julia, Julia was going to say “well how I do it is that—”
Julia: Yes when I pull spears out of my body, here's what happens.
Eric: When I rip off my skin, I have my podcaster form underneath.
Julia: That's true. That's why there's so many wolves in me, because they're all actual wolves.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Eric: Julia pulls off her skin and there's a pack of wolves standing there.
Julia: It's true.
Amanda: Speaking of items hakunayourtatas in the discord see guys if you join the Patreon, you can be in the discord, you can make your name whatever you want, and then if you ask great questions I have to read your name.
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: That’s true.
Amanda: I'm opening myself up here to abuse of this system, but in exchange for your Patreon support I'll do whatever! Alright hakuna says does Eric have a big table of gadgets that Dez and Dr. Morrow could make, or do you create them as you go along depending on how the story progresses?
Eric: No I don't have a big table like I did with the last one because I was very much inspired by TAZ balance at that time where they had the gosh bond subsystem and I wanted to do something similar to that, and that was kind of like what Doov N Boosters was from campaign one. Right now I think that this is more like if someone can invent them for you, I think that it's more story dependent. While in a fantasy world you'd be like I go to the store and I buy magic axe so I don't need like a store inventory, I just hey Dez can you make this for me?
Julia: So we can't go to the store and buy magic axe in Lake Town City?
Eric: You can go to House Warehouse and buy like a really nice light fixture.
Amanda: Milo can get you a replica on ebay, I bet.
Brandon: I bet there's a hatchet at a House Warehouse.
Eric: Yeah but it's not like a magic hatchet.
Brandon: That's true.
Amanda: Any hatchet is a magic hatchet if you're skilled enough.
Julia: It's not a +3 hatchet is what Eric is saying.
Eric: In Aggie’s hands it's a +3 hatchet.
Julia: That's fair.
Amanda: But again like it's it's really fun to be a part of something like item generation, and in this case Eric asked if any of us had items we definitely wanted, or you know skills, or things that we wanted to augment. So like for Aggie you know don't have any like counter spells or anything so neutralizing someone else's power or effects would be really helpful.
Eric: So to that point, I have heard your pitch but spoily corner eyes emoji.
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Julia: Who can say?
Amanda: Who can say what will happen? Julia are valen Hitomi exclusive? Can we have a 10 minute one shot of a Valtomi date, please Eric. Thank you HamiltonOtto.
Brandon: Oooo.
Julia: I like that. I don't think that they've had that exclusivity conversation yet, but I would be down for a ten minute one shot Hitomi date.
Eric: Alright guys get in the Patreon, Julie and I are gonna go into awkwardly role play a date for ten minutes.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: My favorite way of playing d&d, awkwardly role playing dates.
Brandon: Is there another way to date?
Julia: No!
Eric: That's true, good one, good point. I did already make Julia cry as her DM, so I think flirting with her on a date, that's totally a thing.
Julia: Yeah totally fine, yeah.
Eric: I like having Julia here because she emotionally responds to my things, while Brandon and Amanda are like cool alright let's keep going with the episode.
Amanda: I’m so focused on the fun of the story Eric!!! I'm so in the world I'm lost at the fiction!!
Brandon: I don't have emotions so.
Eric: Yeah Brandon's like I'm gonna hear this four times later, so I'll process it later when I'm editing at two in the morning.
Brandon: That's actually real, yeah.
Amanda: Follow-up question for HamiltonOtto what has Emily Slaughter's group done during this time? How well-liked is Flyboy?
Eric: Great question! This is something that we get into in a few episodes from now, but it is something on my mind another thing that I've learned from other games such as Blades in the Dark is that stuff happens while you're not paying attention. So this is kind of what I was alluding to with Tegan's article is that over the fall Emily Slaughter got all of her ducks in a row, and really started pushing the promotion of the Upcountry Keepers. So theoretically they are more famous than y'all, and are out there doing stuff I think people do like Flyboy, and don't have the terrible association with Sour Anthony.
Brandon: No, that's not true.
Eric: But you do.
Brandon: That’s definitely not true.
Eric: But like you know Sour Anthony in his civvies like he's out there in a fucking Top Gun outfit flying around, munching on something.
Julia: He's still the same person!
Brandon: He's still eating?!
Julia: He still sucks.
Brandon: Does he still like sour beer? Or is he just like a sour person now?
Eric: I think he always liked sour beer, but you've seen him as a sour person.
Julia: Also nothing wrong with liking sour beer, so long as that's not your entire personality.
Amanda: Oh I love sour beer.
Brandon: Yes, true.
Eric: I thought his entire personality was he could fly.
Julia: Maybe when he's in his flyboy persona.
Eric: So the thing is that I do think the Upcountry Keepers are well liked. I think Emily has really worked her city connections, and does know how to put on a very nice face to other people, and there is like we talked about right when she showed up in that warehouse. There isn’t an earnestness to her which is true. Like it's definitely grading as we've seen, but I do think that she believes in this stuff. She's not faking it, like she does want to be a hero and wants everyone to know it so that she can do the thing. I think that's really the thing underneath is that she's kind of doing it—she's doing it like she's a politician, so it just it looks pretty fake to us who are the secret underground team just doing their own thing.
Brandon: Yeah. I would also like to note that it is officially the Upcountry Keepers, anytime that you may or may not hear another version of it in the show, just like in your head just here [in a robotic voice] Upcountry Keepers.
Eric: I think I got upcountry— every time I said Upcountry Keepers.
Brandon: No.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Oh no what are the other things?
Julia: Yeah give us the variety, what's another way of saying that?
Brandon: There's avenge up-county is the other way, and then oh there's avengers and—
Amanda: That's just a mouth typo.
Eric: It wasn’t— I knew it was in avengers, I thought it was avengers, but then I was like “no it wouldn't be avengers” because I remember I did it because it was like the Great Lakes Avengers was the play I was doing on it. So it wasn't that so it was Upcountry which is like the high school, and then Keepers was the avengers word. So I know it's Upcountry Keepers, I just didn’t say it.
Brandon: No, I know. I'm just saying, yeah.
Eric: Anyway Upcountry Keepers
Amanda: Rah-rah asks: Eric what do you do when you get a creative block when coming up with story lines do you have a process or is it a sort of like “fuck it I need coffee/chocolate situation?”
Eric: Hmm this is a good one for me—
Brandon: Or is it locks or like a bagel or like h cold brew or like hmm—
Julia: Topo Chico?
Eric: Topo Chico, yeah. Yeah I chug a Topo Chico and like I'm ready to go.
Amanda: Burp once and then you're good to go.
Eric: It's a real— it's a real Popeye situation. For game mechanics I just need to sit down and do it it's a lot like my other writing, it's just like I need to do this thing, and I need to pull it out of my brain, and I need to put it on the page. Because if I don't I'm going to forget it and I need to have something to reference. Because a lot of the stuff that we do on dungeon and dragons is improv, so it's not as singularly important but like if I do need game mechanic stuff like if I'm making a table for you, I need hard and fast things that I do not want to change, and I want to remember because I want this to happen. For example Salimoni needs to have slicked back hair, and a really small cross necklace, I need to write that down. So that I need to just sit down and grind out. In terms of coming up with things I really keep it ambiently on in my brain. There's a theory of creativity that you need to do other things so that your brain can just kind of wander, and I feel like I have ideas for the game in the back of my head running whenever I'm doing something. So if I'm watching tv, or if I'm playing video games, or I'm in the shower honestly just like spacing out, then I think of things and then that's when I go “hehehe” and put hehehe into the Slack.
Brandon: Oh my god.
Amanda: As a person who lives with Eric, sometimes I just look over and he's playing Gungeon, and watching a stream and then he goes “hehehehe”
Brandon: I can only fucking imagine that you hear just from the shower just “hehehehe” that is a nightmare. That's a nightmare situation.
Amanda: It's wonderful.
Eric: If by nightmare, you mean incredible, and turns into good content then yes it's a nightmare! But no it's something that I just try to keep ambiently in the back of my head, and just work on and think about. Because there are things that break that are the ways that stood the story moves, and the way that I see this all the time is like I come up with things then during the session we run it, and then it goes in a different direction, and then I come up with things and that. So it's a real conversation with the stuff that's happening in the session itself. I mean I wish I could already talk about the ways that this has changed— the story has changed from things y'all have done and how that really how it really pivots. I'm very— I'm very happy about it but yeah it's just something I keep in my head. The really big problem for me as a dungeon master, is that I want to tell someone immediately what I did, what I thought of before the game is played so that's when I hit up Mischa Stanton and I'm like “Mischa, you want to hear you want me to spoil the next episode for you?!” And Mischa’s like yeah! And then I tell them and they're like “oh nice” and Mischa helps me a lot. Mischa also helped me with these questions, as I was— we were just throwing ideas at each other it's nice having like another dungeon master around. I feel bad because I feel like I just like I just throw ideas at them, not even necessarily like “help me” it's just like “here's my notes!”
Brandon: Well thank you, and credit to Mischa Stanton for all the help that they've given us over the seasons.
Julia: That is the one thing I do miss about now being a player is I don't get to workshop ideas with you Eric as much.
Eric: Yes.
Julia: We only get to workshop Val ideas, and not campaign ideas.
Eric: I'm sorry, I can't tell you because I need you— I need you to make reactions and go “what?!” or—
Julia: Yes, that's fair.
Eric: That's the validation I need, Ghoulia.
Julia: That's what I'm here for.
Brandon: You can totally do it with me, I will not remember them so it's fine.
Julia: Valid.
Eric: Brandon, do you when you hear something that surprises you go [gasps] the next time, okay?
Brandon: Okay!
Eric: Or just put in a sound effect of you going— of you gasping.
Brandon: Okay that's a good idea, I'll just record all my emotes ahead of time yeah.
Amanda: Yeah just look at some pictures of corgis, and do your reactions, and then or like your niece or something and then you have them at hand.
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: If you donate to our Patreon, we'll get Brandon a sound board for him to backfill his emotions.
Brandon: I could actually probably do that with my keyboard.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Julia: Oh my god here's a related question.
Amanda: Cece would like to know from the discord: is Milo playing dumb to protect himself from embarrassment/guilt? Or does he legit have memory problems or semi semi-blacks out whenever the spirit surges, that kind of thing?
Brandon: Oh Cece, Milo is very dumb.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: No Milo's not playing, I think when he is like you know half jokingly half knowingly talking about like “oh that wasn't me” like that's obviously knowingly, but I think when he we just spirit surge stuff it's not that he doesn't know what's happening, it's that the basic idea of his mechanic of his powers is that there are like literal spirits within him that initially he didn't really know how to at all to um sort of access or use and they would sort of like randomly come out. Um and so now if he's like honed his powers, he can still he has better control over like which one he chooses sort of like a a conveyor belt of spirits that you can just sort of choose from. And now uh there's less and less of those that are like random, but um the spirit surge is a sort of manifestation of those random spirits that attack at random times. So he's not he's not playing dumb, but he is uh useless.
Amanda: Alexis Renee J would like to know from Twitter: how long until Val ends up seeing their mom in a robe at Dr. Morrow's crying laughing emoji eyes emoji.
Julia: Oh no I didn't even see this one, I wasn't prepared.[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Any reaction Julia, or just a slow shaking of the head?
Julia: Oh god I don't want to think about it.
Amanda: Awesome, Perpetual Platypus in the discord if we were villains instead of heroes, what would our villain names be?
Brandon: Ooh fun I think mine would be Killer-Nova.
Eric: I think Kilonova works both ways.
Brandon and Amanda: It does.
Julia: I was gonna say Vulcani I think works just as well on both sides too.
Amanda: Mine would be like the Devastating Forest Fires.
[Julia and Brandon laughing]
Amanda: I don't know anyone at— Julia you helped me come up with Preserver's name, what do you think?
Brandon: Like Extinct or like Extinctor maybe?
Julia: Yeah that's that's a good one, I think like something like Endangered like endangered species.
Eric: There's something about like ranger or something, like Ranger Death.
Brandon: I was just thinking that, Eric!
Julia: It's Ranger Danger!
Everyone: It’s Ranger Danger!
Amanda: Yes!
Eric: That's what it is.
Amanda: Love it.
Julia: That was going to be the original one and then Amanda said no.
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda: I did, I did say that.
Eric: It was very funny. Ranger Danger does sound like a name that Val says like “oh no here but like is ranger and danger, so you got to be ranger danger!”
Julia (as Val): Ranger danger, or danger ranger.
Eric: [Laughing] Danger Ranger! Danger ranger is significantly funnier.
Brandon: Maybe that's what Val calls Aggie in the downtime.
Julia: [Laughs] Yes!
Amanda: Well speaking of which, party tattoos on Twitter asks I know you answered this in series one, but I'm wondering if you have any warm-ups for your new character voices. Mine is just uh accidentally getting too much like Julia's voice and then dialing it back. Because it's so close to where we're from that I just like some part of me is always ordering coffee in a deep Long Island accent, and uh it's hard for me to pull back.
Brandon: What does that sound like?
[Beat of silence]
Amanda: No. No, no I can't Brandon, if I do it I won't stop! Strict abstinence.
Eric: [With a thick Long Island accent] Hey welcome to Bagel Boss what do you got?
Amanda: [Quietly with a Long Island accent] A small coffee with shuguh.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Oh boy.
Eric: Incredible, so Julia you do you have any connection to Val's voice?
Julia: No not at all I don't know what you're talking about.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: No I get into Val's voice with a very specific phrase and it's “what you think is better than me?!”
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: And then I say “no Julia stop beating me up over Zoom”
Julia: I'm sorry.
Eric: Stop reaching through the webcam, and punching me.
Brandon: Milo's voice is pretty much just like a normal guy's voice, so I don't really have to do much. I think he just sort of like he stumbles over his words in a different way than I do, like I have to like pause and think about stuff where Milos just continually talks until he finds it.
Julia: Yes and I feel like he kind of spirals upwards in terms of tone as he does that.
Eric: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Amanda: Very funny.
Julia: Like someone is slowly squeezing his throat. Just tightening up those vocal cords.
Eric:I like the idea that you know like in google translate if you put a sentence into some other language, and then you bring it back to English I feel like with Milo you like put the robot voice that you had for Tracy on it and then you take it back out.
Julia: That feels right, yeah.
Amanda: Suspiciously hot on Twitter asks how many tattoos do the three of them secretly have? I think Aggie no tattoos hmm
Julia: I think Val has a lot of like small tattoos, and a lot of stick and pokes that their friends have done.
Brandon: That's so fucking badass.
Eric: Are they hidden or are they open out in the open?
Julia: I think they're just all over, Val's always wearing a leather jacket though and long pants and boots. So it's not as if they're specifically trying to hide them, it's just they never take off enough layers for people to see them.
Brandon: That's hilarious.
Eric: For sure.
Amanda: I can picture like a classic tattoo sort of pin-up vibe like aesthetic for some of Val’s tattoos.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I'd like to think of their Val has like a giant cross tattoo on their back.
Julia: I thought about that, but no I think that's a little too gaudy for them, it’s not punk enough.
Eric: There's like in the gritty reboot of this there's like a shot of Val getting undressed and you take off your long sleeve shirt and you're from the back and you see the giant cross for the first time but it's half a shadow.
Julia: It's not Boondock Saints. Val is not in Boondock Saints.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Eric: It could be Boondock Saints! It could be!
Julia: Uh uh.
Eric: Oh wait does does Milo have tattoos? Did you get drunk one night and get like uh uh one of the captains tattooed on your chest?
Julia: Like a Green Lantern tattoo?
Brandon: Yeah, actually—
Amanda: Just William Shatner's profile.
Brandon: No I think Milo might— one Milo has to be professional at a museum so like he can't have anything visible, or like not it's not a lot—
Amanda: Oh come on, it's a cool museum!
Brandon: It's not a rule it's not like a written rule, but like you know he has to wear polos sometimes during the summer, so he wants to maintain decorum. I think he probably has like I'm trying to think of a you know how lots of people have like three threesome tattoos where it's like the deathly hallows, or like whatever you wanna whatever those things are what's like a four the trinity yeah but is there anything like a four? Because I'm sure I'm sure Milo, and Lucas, and Apple, and Zack have like four part tattoo.
Julia: All of them have Avatar the Last Airbender signs.
Brandon: That’s good!
Julia: Tell me quick what everyone's uh bending is.
Eric: Oh I got this Lucas is— Lucas is fire. Zack Rose is air, Apple is earth, and Milo is water.
Julia: That checks out.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: Yeah so maybe it's that or maybe like you know, their favorite captains or favorite like insignia maybe— OHH. Okay maybe it's they each have the like name of the starship of their favorite captain like tattooed on there.
Eric: Ooh that's cool.
Amanda: That's a good one.
Brandon: Or something.
Amanda: I like that.
Eric: Oh I was envisioning you getting drunk one night and getting the face of Picard just like on your right breast.
Brandon: I just—
Julia: So he's always proud of you.
Brandon: I didn't— I did not say that we just don't talk about it.
Eric: Oh okay got it, got it, got it.
Julia: Also Brandon we would have seen that tattoo when Milo got all of his clothes burned off.
Brandon: [Laughs] That's true, that's true!
Julia: Right combat.
Eric: Yeah go back and edit this idea in.
Amanda: Well I cannot wait to ask you all more questions including Megan corner, and spoily corner. But first I'm going to run into the kitchen to refill our caramel corn.
Brandon: [Gasps] Yes! I love it.
Julia: Oooo!
[Transition note]
Eric: Hey it's Eric, for those of you who don't know Rosh Hashanah the beginning of the Jewish year is coming up this Friday, and for those jews out there who are celebrating Rosh Hashanah or jews out there who didn't know, hey Rosh Hashanah is on Friday! Congratulations Rosh Hashana shana tova. But I always liked that Rosh Hashanah was kind of like new year's, but it was happening in the fall because the fall always felt like the beginning of something. Like the summer we were sweating out, and now we can finally reflect on everything that's happened over this year, and I know it kind of matches on the school year, and maybe that's part of it because I was a high school English teacher there for a second, but starting the year off with the warm flavors of fall, like honey and apples and raisins and challah, and all having an amazing incredible Rosh Hashanah meal, it always just felt like the start of something new even if the fall was kind of the end of something. But you know you can start whenever you want it's a new year doesn't really mean anything anymore, so whenever you want to start again you can! Welcome to the midroll, I brought you apples and honey and it's delicious.

[Transition note]
Amanda: Back from the kitchen, is everybody enjoying their snack?
Julia: It's delicious!
Eric: [In a childish voice] It's all stuck on my teeth!
Amanda: Oh no!
Eric: Oh no!
Everyone: Oh no Pwosovor!
Brandon: Real quick can you do an impression of that kid with marshmallows in their mouth saying Preserver?
Eric: Okay uh so Izzy is at the fair, and put a giant blob of cotton candy in their mouth, and then the Preserver runs in and fights off like an army of bunnies that have been possessed, that are running into the carnival. And it was like
Eric (as Izzy the kid): Oh Pwosovor! Whuh happened wimth the bunnies?!
[Eric laughing]Brandon: Oh no!
Amanda: And Izzy's toddler brother Ira is just standing there holding a balloon pointing.
Eric: Yeah!
Amanda: And like a lollipop falls out of his mouth.
Eric: Wow so cute!
Amanda: I wanted to open up with a sweet comment, not a question and best pitman you are the one person allowed to do this in the most recent episode Eric mentioned a co-worker of Milos. A preparator he pronounced it like a superhero for peppers, or a fancy device to get things ready it's actually pronounced preparator. It's tricky when you've only ever read a word and I appreciate all your hard work.
Eric: Ohhh.
Brandon: Yes this is first of all I want to say this was a fucking great way to send a correction. No one else is allowed to do it.
Amanda: Tank you very much. When you make a podcast thousands of people tell you the same thing because everybody thinks that they're the only person who hears it, and it's like everybody is acting with great intention, and then you get dozens of emails, and it's like oh my god, and it is it is crushing. So thank you best.
Brandon: So yeah be very kind, and be very nice, and like be like “oh look at this interesting fact I found!” But also too that is the coolest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
Eric: Preparator yes I said preparatory.
Amanda: It looks like preparator.
Brandon: It does.
Eric: There's also like oh someone also said arc— like it's arch-i’ve-ist instead of arch-eh-vist or something they were less nice so we're not shouting out. Also to people who've only read words on the page, and have never said them out loud hey just say them out loud, the worst thing that happens is someone tells you you're wrong, and then you can harbor that in your in your soul, and get revenge on them later. But like that's really the worst thing that could happen so I did it. I did it and it got recorded for all the annals of time so! You just do it. It's okay you know bigger words than other people.
Julia: I'll share one to share the embarrassment I once meant uh to say ethereal, and I said urethral.
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: Oh Julia!
Amanda: That's great.
Eric: That's pretty good.
Brandon: I also think that that word preparator is a fairly new position, so not only is it like a hard word to read on the page and read aloud, but it is also a fairly new word that came out in the last like 30 years or something like that— 20 years?
Amanda: Also English? Made up.
Brandon: That's true.
Amanda: That's frankenstein's creature of different other languages, no one knows how latin was pronounced, and we all just try, and uh language is about meaning. So if— if you get the meaning, I'm always interested in new words and their pronunciations as just like a fun fact. But otherwise you're good, you get it! We get it!
Brandon: Language is about communication.
Amanda: Edgars wrote via email in your last afterparty you talked about current events in the world impacting our view on the police and the government in general, and I wanted to ask about current real-world situations impacting the game world so mostly Eric are you planning to incorporate current events into the game world, if so how much? Because it's an alternate universe with the discovery of diaphragm and the whole world being at the mercy of you and some dice, I believe this would give you enough leeway to change some stuff, like the police being reformed, the president not having the virus, etc.
Eric: Oh beans, um here's the thing that I learned from late night writers. Something that everyone asked them is like when Trump got elected every single reporter went to late night writers, and people who made comedy. I was like “oh man look at this wild and crazy guy, isn't this gonna make your job easier?” and then all of them said “no, this is terrible because the world is bad, and now we can't make jokes about it. Because of a regular world and then you make fun of it, but now it's just like it's already absurd” so that is similarly how I feel I have no interest in having a different world and putting in our current president current place, and the stuff of the virus— I mean this is in a different world hopefully if any sort of epidemic or pandemic would have happened a lot of people would have been more prepared, and a lot of people would have been all on the same side, we would have done stuff to curb this. But we didn't and like that's not a fun place to live in, as shown by us living in this world. So the things about like the president, and the virus, no I don't want to touch those. In terms of police reform I think that that is a very important issue and something that we do need to deal with with super a—superhero story. If we were doing a fantasy story it would have been like the idea of like a city guard, or people who protect you that is a thing that's just the truth like they're actually doing the right thing, and they're on your side. But I think that also ties to like some stuff that I said last time which is like tv shows, or books, or movies where police are valorized, and we assume they're always on the same side, and they're doing everything for goodness, and justice. Well that's not necessarily true. So I think that this idea as we try to examine the role of people who have powers who are trying to keep a society going, and doing stuff as wild shit starts happening, that is something I want to play with, and an interesting theme. But if I didn't have to touch it, I want to make a conscious decision to interrogate some of those ideas. Which is why we're keeping that and not touching the other ones, because that's not fun and not something I have, or I think any of us want to play with and have things to say other than like “wow really fucking blows huh?” I mean we touch ideas of related that like xenophobia, I mean isn't that all X-Men is the idea of xenophobia? There's something about an otherness of people with powers and people who don't and we're already seeing some of that with that councilman, so we're touching on themes that are happening. But no the president and the pandemic are not coming into this particular story.
Brandon: Yeah I'd be curious I'm always interested in how media reflects our world, and like I'm going to be super curious to see in the next like 20 years like what um like zombie stories, or other like disease stories are going to be like. Because I think with uh with you need like hindsight in order to like interrogate those things, and dissect them, and really like heal from them in media, and so yeah I think in the middle of them is not the right time.
Eric: Yeah I have no— like have you seen some of these like pandemic tv shows they're trying to try to come out? There was like a rom-com like love in the time of pandemic?
Brandon: No? What?!
Eric: Oh it was coming out on like ABC Family I'm like I have no interest in this, why would you do this?!
Brandon: No, it's not like people's families have been you know completely disrupted or or have lost loved ones it's not something we make light of.
Brandon: Quarantine’s not fun, it's just not.
Amanda: It's not done, we don't know how it ends.
Eric: We're still very much in the middle of it. Yes exactly, I agree with Brandon on that point, I think that monsters as metaphor and is always something that I find very interesting. But like we're right in the teeth of it ,so not really it's not a real fun thing to do. I'm not allowed to look at Julia's dice in person. Yeah that's that's the biggest thing I've had to sacrifice quarantine I can't look at Julia's dice rolls.
Amanda: I do think too that uh the idea of like people with powers is probably an an interesting kind of metaphor for like privilege, or societal power, in terms of you know what do you do with the power you have, and how can you put it to use to benefit those around you. I'm sure there have been uh scholarly papers written about that but just a little a little thought.
Eric: Yeah that's true that's something we we definitely— I think we talked about that like in the first few, what I was talking the theme episode all the way in the back like that was 100% something I wanted to do. What is the kind of person when you have power what do you do with it? We're already literally seeing it between the generational divide that uh everyone's parents didn't do much, and you are all doing stuff. That's kind of what Dr. Morrow was getting at in the first few episodes.
Amanda: I think it's time for a visit to Megan Corner who has sent in even more good questions!
Eric: It's from Megan good questions yeah!
Amanda: Who came up with Milo's friend group?
Brandon: I think I gave you like I probably have some friends at the museum and they probably all have different jobs, but I'm terrible at NPCs and names so go from there.
Eric: Yeah Brandon gave me archetypes of all of his friend group, and it's like here go and then he forgot about them, as you do. And then I just came up with them, and now we have this friend group. I'm really also starting to— and this is something I'm just very excited about that I've been noticing starting in episode 12. I've really been getting into like who these people are more so, I feel this way about Lucas now that he has three people to bounce off of instead of just Milo. And I feel this way a lot about Dr. Morrow, um but Dr. Morrow is becoming more and more Doc Brown from yes like over and over and I love it so much. And I really feel like Lucas is becoming like super sheisty, and like very Get Rich Quick he's like Ed from Ed, Edd n Eddy. I just I love it so much. I'm sorry no he's he's Eddy from Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
Julia: I knew what you meant.
Eric: Thank you, Julia, thank you. I have really needed the correction it was very important to me. So I'm really feeling some of these NPCs now um which I really enjoy.
Amanda: I decorate my walls with lots of stuff, crafts, photos, polaroids, what do your characters cover their walls in?
Julia: Band posters.
Brandon: Mmmm, mhm!
Eric: Classic!
Julia: Not even in frames just like tack boarded onto the wall.
Brandon: Oofa doofa. I think Milo has like meticulously organized, and displayed all of his memorabilia from various films, and tv shows, and and things that he loves are all very well displayed. But his like bed has never made, and like his closet's a mess.
Julia: Hell yeah.
Eric: You have a shrine to all of Dr. Morrow's biographies, but you have—but your sheet is like half coming off.
Amanda: One day you're going to ask Dr. Morrow to sign them, but you didn't do it right away and so now that you know each other it's kind of weird—
Julia: And awkward.
Amanda: So absolutely uh will at some point in the distant future get some signatures. I think Aggie has some like vintage postcards, and maps from the Lake Town area that she has framed and hung in the cottage.
Eric: I like that you have like one set of string lights that Quinn sent you one time.
Amanda: Yeah! Appreciate it, Sushi likes them!
Julia: Very cute.
Eric: These are Sersha Ronan, and yeah I thought you should have them, you tried to throw them out.
Amanda: And I don't realize they cost like $2,000. Yeah when I have to replace the bulb, we're gonna find out. Speaking of which Milo has Tuna, Aggie has Sushi, what would Val's pet be?
Julia: Val has the dogs that they dog walk, Val doesn't need to own a pet.
Amanda: No—no pets at home? You just have like your sauce making pot?
Julia: I have a studio apartment, you want me to put a large dog in there? No.
Brandon: [Laughing] I like that Amanda just insinuated that your pot was like your pet.
Julia: Like I have a basil plant that's my pet.
Amanda: My dutch oven is a valued member of our family.
Eric: I like that. Val strikes me as someone who's like a dog uncle. Like you’re renting them, and then you're like “alright go back to your owners!”
Julia: Yep!
Eric: And don't poop in my house!
Brandon: I mean that's the dream.
Eric: You're also someone who strikes me as like who has big fish energy. Like you have a giant aquarium with like three really large beta or like fighting fish.
Julia: I think that requires too much effort, and I think Val likes a cuddly animal. Like if they had a pet, it would be a dog but I don't think that they feel like they would be a responsible pet owner. So they don't own a pet. It's part of the reason they took up dog walking as a side hustle.
Brandon: What a mature and responsible adult human being, if you can't take care of an animal don't buy an animal.
Julia: It's very punk to be a responsible dog owner.
[Amanda laughs]
Amanda: Speaking of being punk, what are your character's favorite music to listen to? Or do you listen to something else? Podcast etc.
Brandon: We talked about this when we were doing our first episode, about like what our background music would be.
Eric: Yes! I took that from that was the introductory music as as we went in and we zoomed into your first environmentsm I remember that.
Amanda: Oh yeah!
Eric: Like Milo's was like some Devo like 80’s style, like Val obviously loves some loud music. I feel like you had some Billy Joel like Bruce Springsteen stuff classic rock happening?
Amanda: Yeah I think like Grateful Dead, Doobie Brothers or something along those lines.
Eric: I feel like I also touched on that a little bit when I made the playlist for each of the characters, um for Milo it was like a lot of a lot of that sort of like bouncy, and weird stuff.
Brandon: Anything that you would go to like a show for and like it's just a bunch of awkward lanky white teens, and they're just like dancing like weirdly you know? Like no one's on drugs or anything they're just fucking weird.
Julia: They're just ska-ing the hell out of the whole situation.
Amanda: Just doing their thing!
Eric: What I do I remember for for Milo's playlist: I took a lot of stuff that Griffin McElroy has recommended on Wonderful and then I added some ska.
Brandon: That sounds right.
Julia: Feels right.
Eric: For Val’s, it was more like loud rock, and stuff. I did a lot of like Riot Girl and female fronted punk. But for Aggie, Aggie I had such a specific sense of Aggie liking indie rock from the early to mid aughts, and like your music taste hasn't changed. Like you're still listening to Bright Eyes.
Amanda: Yeah I mean—
Brandon: That's not a bad thing Eric!
Amanda: Why would you replace it?
Eric: It's not! iI's just like, well I still make playlists like this. But I have playlists from college that I made, that I remember and I'm like “oh I'm just gonna pull all of these songs” and then this is Aggies playlist in 2020.
Amanda: It's a real time capsule in a good way!
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Join the Patreon you can listen to them. Just so you know.
Brandon: Go buy Bright Eyes’ new album!
Amanda: Because the campaign takes place in the modern day, do your characters have any favorite social media? As discussed, Aggie huge on Reddit!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Which subreddits does Aggie traffic?
Amanda: DIY, woodworking, different like homesteading, and like small-scale farming, permaculture huge with Aggie. Home renno, and she'll be in there being like “uh hey I don't know if you guys consulted a structural engineer, but like you just cut a support beam so I would just check that out, just looking after your safety, sorry man!”
Eric: Is Aggie big on power washing porn?
Amanda: Oh definitely yeah!
Brandon: Does Aggie like the one that like you fit uh small things perfectly inside of slightly larger things?
Eric: Oh oddly satisfying yeah yeah yeah.
Amanda: There's oddly satisfying, there’s perfect fit, which is things fitting perfectly.
Eric: Oh I didn’t know there's a specific one there, like most of—Amanda: Then there's like organization porn, where they'll do like the flat like the the flat lay situation. It's just very soothing.
Brandon: Nice.
Eric: I just want to talk about power washing porn, because we skipped right over it, and it's very important to me.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Have you seen power washing porn?! It is the best!
Brandon: Yes, yes.
Amanda: It's very, very clear that the satisfaction is just that you see things that were dirty get clean, and that is the content of the videos in case you don't know what that is.
Eric: But we're using a power washer, which is like the most dangerous thing you can rent from Home Depot.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: And yes I am also talking about the saws and stuff, power washers are more dangerous.
Julia: Okay!
Eric: True! Have you— I've been— I've seen those those are dangerous! They can like flay you that's real shit!
Brandon: If you get like a professional one, like the homeowner ones are not very powerful.
Eric: They can be. But you haven't turned them up to 11 Brandon.
Amanda: I think you know that a saw is dangerous, but not everybody may know that the pressure of a power washer is dangerous.
Brandon: Yeah. What about you Julia? What's Val social media?
Julia: I think that was really into myspace, and then when that fell off they just kind of were like “what's the point?”
Amanda: Very well adjusted.
Eric: Yeah apparently tumblr is still doing well though.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: Maybe tumblr is owned by Morrow Corp instead of Yahoo, and they kept all the porn, so it's okay.
Julia: Yeah and they stopped making silly changes to it.
Eric: And they actually— and then Dr. Morrow looked at it and we're like “why are— these ads make no sense? Can we run real ads?”
Julia: No! The ads are so good. Dr. Morrow made it so the ads are rebloggable finally.
Eric: Yes! Exactly! That's— she actually monetized them, and made the ads reblocable 100% that's hilarious!
Brandon: I think Milo isn't much into social media, he probably has a twitter. I don't think he really keeps up with it that much. He does give ideas to the museum social media person occasionally.
Amanda: Nice.
Julia: See Milo feels like a secret tumblr person to me. Just because full fandom.
Brandon: Well see that is entirely possible, and like probable. But real life Brandon knows jack shit about tumblr, so he would not be able to role play that.
Eric: Brandon, Lauren's right there just get her.
Julia: Lauren’s right behind you!
Amanda: Or maybe individual like fan forums that were started in like the early aughts for the franchises that he likes.
Brandon: Yeah cause Milo's definitely more of like a collection fandom, as opposed to like a um uh what he calls the interactive fandom, or whatever so he probably less tumblr, more like forums for sure.
Eric: Yeah, you might be —you might be a discord person. I feel like there are discords for ebay stuff that you might be on.
Brandon: Oh yeah he does every in and out of ebay. Like he's on everything, it's not really quite social media, but he knows everything about ebay.
Eric: Oh yeah.
Amanda: Ebay can be your social media if you try hard enough.
Brandon: That's true!
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: And here our final question in Megan Corner uh— buts spoily corner! They're intersecting, it's great!
Brandon: HAH! Amanda said a buts!
Amanda: A buts! Oh I was gonna say earlier I continued to this day maybe once a month I'll say a word that I realize immediately afterward I have never said and only read, so it happens to me all the time, and uh don't be shy fellow bookish kids who didn't talk much and just read, uh it's gonna be okay.
Eric: Here's a word I've never said out loud deciderous? Deciduous? Decision? Deciduous?
Amanda: Deciduous.
Eric: Deciduous!
Julia: There you go. It's okay, Amanda and I constantly get into debates about how to pronounce necromancy, which Amanda thinks “ne-crow-macy”
Amanda: Oh I don't have a position, I just say it “ne-crow-macy” or I used to.
Julia: Okay!
Brandon: Ne-crow-macy? That's a lot more fun honestly, yeah.
Eric: I like the ne-crow-macmy yeah.
Amanda: I'm also I'm also consistently trying to get away from the Long Island “a” and so necromancy sounds like a thing that like my aunt would say. And so I'm like “ne-crow-mancy” please.
Brandon: How dare you hey god a long island necromancer would be such a good—
Julia: Oop, I just found my next one-shot character, thank you!
Eric: [In a Long Island accent] Ey, you gotta watch out uh, we're near Long Island, uh sunrise highway, there's some zombies there from a necro—necromancy.
Amanda: Necromancy!
Julia: [In a Long Island accent] There's a necromancer over there! And he's really really fuckin’ things up!
Amanda: [In a Long Island accent] How's the nephew? He's a necromancer, you know.
Julia: He makes good money though!
Amanda: Makes good money though! Oh god.
Eric: Pension.
Amanda: [In her regular voice] Oh, oh boy.
Eric: So I says to her I says :he's a necromancer!”
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda: Alright for the rest of spoilery corner, are you ready? I'm just gonna do them one by one!
Eric: Deciduous is the opposite of evergreen by the way.
Amanda: Yeah.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Yes what are the rest of the O'Hare's powers?
Julia: Who can say!
Amanda: Who can say!
Everyone: Who can saaay!
Julia: There's still a debate about what Quinn's powers are fully.
Amanda: Yeah! Rah-rah asks what does the Knight of Mirrors think of Emily, have they met is the Knight helping both sides?
Julia: Who can say!
Amanda: [Voice goes higher pitched] Who can say!
Julia: We haven't heard from the Knight in a while.
Brandon: I mean almost oh most definitely.
Eric: Here's the—here's the thing guys, motorcycles don't do well in the snow.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: That's very good, good point, thank you for that.
Eric: Yeah that’s when the Knight of Mirrors hibernates they're a bear, they've been a bear this whole time.
Julia: Oh okay checkst out. Oh Eric I have a question yeah when Hitomi and Val met was Hitomi trying to get Val to steal beers for her?
Eric: [Laughs] Yeah, 100%
Julia: Alright something I need to know about her character, I suppose.
Eric: Yeah I mean she she said that she was getting ignored by the bartender for like it's like 20 minutes, so she just wanted to take matters into her own hands. I think it was a real like can you just grab two beers and I leave a 10 on the table sort of situation.
Julia: It wasn't just like steal beers from me random person?
Eric: No Hitomi was ignored by the bartender, and you seemed like a regular, which is why she talked to you.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And that's how love bloomed.
Julia: Hmm.
Brandon: That is very much adult Brandon's move at this point, where it's like alright I've given you 15 minutes, I'm now going to do it in my on my own.
Amanda: Yeah that's my favorite kind of heist where it's like there's an inefficient system and I can just cut to the feeling uh as it were, and get the thing I need and get out.
Eric: So the heist that we're throwing for your 30th—
Amanda: Yeah thank you.
Eric: Are we not stealing money, but you just need to like make a wire transfer and no one will talk to you, so we have to heist it with guns, so that you can just make a wire transfer?
Amanda: I did uh the first thing I said to Eric this morning was “I figured out how to do a free wire transfer” because uh we could like upgrade our business checking account, and then if you have a certain minimum balance, then you have a free wire transfer but even if you don't have the minimum balance, it's still cheaper to have the monthly account fee with two free wire transfers, than to pay a $25 per wire transfer fee.
Julia: Wow, wow.
Amanda: That's adulthood.
Julia: Wow.
Eric: Same.
Brandon: That's a heist!
Eric: That's a heist!
Amanda: Listen sometimes you gotta get through the minutiae of adulthood by pretending that administrative tasks are instead heists, and it's just working out for me.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Well that is all for this afterparty, thank you for your questions. As always you can tweet to us, email us, or best of all leave them in the afterparty channel of our patron only discord. And thank you so much for listening along and for making fan arts, and jokes, and being excited about new episodes. It's very exciting for us to make stuff that not just we enjoy, but people say that they enjoy so please keep doing that!
Brandon: [In a deep gruff voice]It's the fuel that keeps us going!
Eric: I mean yeah, you're right yeah.
Brandon: [Regular voice] I just said it in a cool voice, but it was real.
Eric: That's Milo's voice, when Milo gets a handle on his powers, he's gonna sound like this. Thank you for your January fanart, I want January to say “Fuck” that sounds great. He's my good special little boy, and one of my top five NPCs of all time. So uh just just keep doing it I like that! It's very nice.
Brandon: I would like it noted for my own just benefit, that I did not stop January from saying fuck!
Amanda: He did! He did in episode 12, he said fuck.
Brandon: He did, I want the credit.
Eric: He said fuck?
Julia: Yeah you said fuck.
Amanda: That we skipped the good joke corner, my only contribution was that I said piss which I thought was really funny.
Julia: That was a good one.
Amanda: But January said—
Eric: The joke corner was that an entire episode 12 .
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: For patrons you saw, but I made an agenda that January was running for that meeting, and we all contributed to it in character. It was very funny.
Brandon: It was so much fun!
Eric: So that was that whole episode was just a good joke for me. Also Dr. Morrow showing up 20 minutes late no matter what is also was very on point for me. Oh sorry—this is related to really getting into Dr. Morrow when she said electrons, that has literally been flowing through me, that is like the energy that was like the moment that I understood what Dr. Morrow's character was.
Amanda: Right on well we will be back next week with uh lucky episode 13, and it's just— it's just getting, it's just getting up from here guys like this we have had so much fun these last few episodes, and you are really really going to enjoy them!
Brandon: Bye guys!
Julia: Later!
Eric: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here cause there's a volcano?! What?!
Everyone: Oh noooo!

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party…
Eric: It's December and LTC where the snow and presence are bountiful, and the normalcy and temperature is zero. Vulcani the Preserver and Kilonova have scrapped with baddies all through the fall but they need some refining on their skills... Since you know they blew up a football field and that was kind of bad. Dr. Morrow calls a meeting the next day to regroup and train. In their normal lives Milo and his friends give nerdy gifts to each other, including a life-size stormtrooper figure from his best friend Lucas. Val met and flirted with Hiomi who has incredible fashion and chew taste and was cajoled by a second cousin of theirs to go see Aunt Min. The aunt on their mob's father's side who may or may not got the sight. Aggie brought her youngest sister the famous actress Quinn to a home goods store where Quinn dodged some overzealous fans with her ability to climb up walls. I didn't know she had that, that's wild! Uh let's all turn to our quarter three reports, and look at the projections for how rad this episode is gonna be. Let's get the party started!
[Theme music]
Eric: So Dr. Morrow has called a meeting and theoretically a training session the next day she says wear something you can move in, and you won't get hot. What do you all wear as you go over to Dr. Morrow's? I guess let's call this like it's a noon meeting, so you can all go over whenever you like.
Brandon: It's a noon meeting so I show up at 3 P.M.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: That would be bad, that would be pretty bad.
Amanda: I think I arrive at 11 55 A.M. wearing some old hiking cargo pants with like bike shorts underneath, because I don't know if she means that I should wear something that I won't get hot in, or like we are not going to get hot so dress warm, so I have layers.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: And a tank top with then a sweatshirt with cut off sleeves on top.
Eric: It's extremely good I wish I was the kind of person to wear a sweatshirt with cut off sleeves, and I'm glad Aggie is.
Amanda: It's like
Amanda (as Aggie): What? You got to keep the core warm I don't wanna buy one of those patagonia vests.
Eric (as Aggie): Yeah the vests don't really do anything, it's just markup, and like I can just do this at home.
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen on the trail if you find yourself away, keep the core warm! That's what they tell you.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric (as Aggie): You can lose 50% of your extremities and honestly it's fine.
Amanda: Yeah absolutely.
Brandon: That's on Aggies like Myspace page from ‘98.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Aggie has one of those survivalist handbooks you know they were like really popular in Urban Outfitters a few years ago that it's like “500 Ways to Survive Danger!” and it had like Ikea drawings and all that Aggie has like the original one before all the hipsters found it.
Brandon: All the illustrations are of Aggie it's weird a bunch of post-its correcting what's wrong, and she keeps it in her office at the museum in case kids try to yell at her about like drinking tree sap or some shit.
[Brandon and Julia laughing]
Brandon: Milo shows up at like 12:13, and he's wearing g's and a t-shirt because he doesn't like to wear shorts in public.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Smart, smart.
Brandon: So he shows up but he asked if there's a place where he could change, and he just wears like basketball shorts that he wore to gym class in high school because he hasn't played basketball or worked out since
[Julia laughing]
Brandon: And an old commemorative like 25th anniversary Star Wars shirt.
Eric: Oh I love that. I like the idea that these are like and one branded shorts that you got at like TJ Maxx in like 2011.
Brandon: Yup! They're like a little too long and a little too short.
Eric: [Laughing] They're long in the leg but somehow it rides up on you still.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: So uncomfortable.
Amanda: I was going to say short on the leg long in the crotch which is not going to make it into the episode.
Eric: Isn't that a Janelle Monae song?
Amanda: It should be!
Julia: Val's wearing the same thing they always do. Why is this a question? They also show up at like 12:13 same time as Milo be like
Julia (as Val): Oh hey.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey what up?
Amanda: Aggie's been waiting in excruciating quiet with January.
[Everyone laughs]
Brandon: Milo does show up with a large carrot juice that he got from the juice bar in the hipster area to gift to January.
Eric: Oh nice! What's the name of that juice bar?
Brandon: It is um... let's see let's just call them Juicems
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Uuuhhh
Brandon: Or Squeezums?
Julia: No worse.
Amanda: Oh no, no no.
Eric: I like the idea that it might just be called the Juice Bar but people call it Juicems and Squeezums.
Brandon: Yeah Juicems and Squeezums that's what I was late for, there we go.
Eric: [Laughing] Juicems and Squeezums a Christmas classic.
Julia: Ew.
Eric: Alright at this point January is waiting for all of you at the door and leads you down to the third floor where the meeting room is. The designated meeting room this one has like mid 2010 startup energy like lots of glass everywhere, but it's just one room so you can look into it and it's like a really bespoke and reclaimed wood table, and like those really like extra ergonomic chairs before standing was the new thing, it was like no I just need the right chair for my body. Everything is see-through except for the chairs, and the table like the even the white board is see-through. So yeah January leads you downstairs and Val and Milo you see Aggie just like sitting quietly at the table.
Amanda: I'm reading the newspaper, it's a physical newspaper like you know a person.
Eric: Mickie circled three particular instances on the Aggie Blotter for you.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: Just trying to help.
Amanda (as Aggie): Mickie I'm paying you for the paper not for your annotated version of the paper.
Eric (as Mickie): It's all— honestly I could charge you for it that's what media companies are doing, I could paywall this but I'm giving it to you for free.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know Mickie I think you'd be really good at that, I really appreciate your perspective and you're a true heart of this town.
Eric (as Mickie): Listen if who's going to be able to take care of the bagels if I don't though, so I can't just go off and start a media company and then sell that media company, and then go to bermuda and live out the rest of my days paddle boarding, and doing that stand up paddle boarding which has a different name but I don't have experience paddle boarding so I don't know the name of the paddle board.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Aggie places a solemn hand on her shoulder and then walks out.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Back in the present, January says
Eric (as January): Uh so it sounds like a lot of you had the right instincts because Dr. Morrow still needs another 10 minutes, so just hang out.
Julia (as Val): See!
Brandon (as Milo): Uh January I got— I got this for you it's a it's a large carrot juice with ginger and um one of those lids with no straw because I know you don't like straws.
Eric (as January): You know honestly I do keep my own metal straws here so thank you I'm glad that you noticed.
Brandon (as Milo): You're welcome, I know you care about the environment a lot.
Eirc (as January): I do also now you have, I assume that there is also the joy of seeing me hold a 32 ounce plastic cup of orange liquid, so I guess you could just enjoy that.
Julia (as Val): It is pretty enjoyable.
Brandon (as Milo): Nooo, that wasn’t my intention.
Eric (as January): No I know I look adorable, although it's fine.
Julia (as Val): It is very cute.
Eric (as January): I don't know listen, becoming an awakened animal has made me very self-aware so don’t like— again let's just not be weird let's just keep it all out in the open.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Can I take a photo and use it as my cell phone background January? Is that— is that cool?
Eric (as January): Oh hell yeah!
Julia: That's not being weird.
Eric: January hops into a chair, and like holds on to the juice like with both his top paws and his bottom paws.
Amanda: Aww.
Eric: And he's drinking from it, he’s drinking from his metal straw as well so it's very adorable.
Brandon: Milo takes a photo and it is his background for life.
Eric (as January): Listen if you just download Lightroom you can really boost the contrast, and it really brings out my fur.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh I love it yeah, I'll do that right now!
Amanda: Aggie places on the table a tiny deep purple knit bow tie.
Eric (as January): Oh than—oh my god thank you, I assume—sorry I shouldn't assume this is for me.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah it’s for you— you don't need to make it weird or anything but I knit.
Eric (as January): No that was cool I actually don't have any knit like this color usually the ones that you can buy that are you for like very fancy cape cod children, so the colors are just in black or white so this is a happy color is really helpful!
Amanda (as Aggie): Or like forest green, like the only knit tie you can possibly own is forest green come.
Eric (as January): Oh yeah exactly like I'm not a Kennedy living on Hiatus Point, like I'm a real adult b—rabbit who needs not childish clothes.
Julia (as Val): You almost said bunny but you're like “no no that's too derivative”
Eric (as January): No I'm an adult rabbit!
Eric: Wonderful.
Julia: Val just goes
Julia (as Val): Are we doing gifts now? Like the holiday gift thing?
Eric: Yeah a Val what do you have?
Julia: Val just like pulls out of their leather jacket like uh one is an envelope, and the other is like a small box, it's not like ring size it's like if you were getting a piece of jewelry that was like a larger piece like a necklace or something like that, and hands the envelope to Aggie first.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh I um I'm still working on—
Julia (as Val): It is okay you don't have to give me a gift right now, it is alright you also just don't have to give me a gift in general, it's okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh that's— that's very thoughtful should I open it now or— I never—
Julia (as Val): Yeah you can open it now it's okay okay.Amanda: I open it
Julia: It is a gift card to a place that does goat yoga.
Amanda: Aggie’s eyes fill with tears.
Brandon: Now what is that exactly? Is that goats doing yoga? Is that doing yoga alongside goats?
Julia: It is doing yoga alongside goats, and because goats like to be in high places when you do certain poses, they just jump on you.
Amanda (as Aggie): [Overcome with happiness] I get to be the highest place.
Amanda: She just says through tears.
[Eric laughs]
Julia (as Val): I'm glad you like it
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you so much.
Julia (as Val): I'm very happy.
Julia: And then hands the small box to Milo.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh I um I see what happened is—I— I ordered yours—
Julia (as Val): Again you do not have to give me gifts it is okay!
Brandon (as Milo): No no, I got you one, I got you a really great one I ordered it and it was uh it turns out it was back ordered, so it's taking a while to get here. But I did get you a good really great gift.
Julia (as Val): Okay
Brandon: And I open the package.
Julia: Inside is a cast of the George Clooney Batman suit nipple.
Eric: YES.
Julia: And Val goes
Julia (as Val): Well see— okay my mom knows the guy who made the suit for this movie and it seemed like you would be like super into that, so she had the guy give her a copy of the cast.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: And for out of character I wrote these down on May 28th at 3:04 in the morning.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: You are incredible and the best gift giver both in and out of character I have ever met.
Julia: [Laughing] Thank you.
Brandon: Writing down “George Clooney's nipple”
Julia: Which I did—I wrote that before episode 9 where you said you put on the George Clooney batman mask which is hilarious to me.
Amanda: Incredible.
Brandon: So that was just serendipity?
Julia: Yeah just serendipity, there it is.
Eric: More like seren-nippity.
[Julia groans]
Brandon: Oh nice, nice, nailed it.
Eric: Nice, nice, nice.
Brandon: Milo's like
Brandon (as Milo): Oh my god now I can wear my mask and have one Batman nipple this is great thank you so much.
Julia (as Val): Figured you could probably build it out if you really want to, but also I don't want to encourage you to make a full Batman costume.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh no I would never do that of course not, why would I ever do that—Dr. Morrow are you here? Do you have time?
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you Val.
Brandon (as Milo): Thank you Val.
Eric: At this point Dez amble's over you can see Dez walking from like the other side of the house too, just from all the fact that everything is see-through, and holds the door open for Dr. Morrow who's wearing exactly the same thing as you saw her last. White lab coat pushed up, but this time her hair is a little bit less askew and maybe it's up.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh great alright well I'm glad that we'll get this meeting started, thank you all for waiting for me, this is just something you probably need to get used to, so when I say 12 do show up at 12 but also I will be here at 12:25.
Julia (as Val): Alright so we will show up at 12:25.
Brandon (as Milo): You could just assume that I'm always there at 12.
Julia (as Val): You got here you got here same time as me my dude.
Brandon (as Milo): [Whispering] Shhh, this is our out.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Like I said, everyone should be there at least 12:05 and then I'll show up at 12:20.
Brandon (as Milo): Exactly we always are!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay, alright let's get uh this started, so let's yeah let's all take a seat.
Eric: Dr. Morrow pulls up a chair, Dez goes to like the back of the room and pulls the chair over to the corner and takes out like a very big uh yellow notepad and like a chewed on pencil.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey Dez! I didn't say hi yet, hey Dez!
Eric (as Dez): Oh hey hey what's going on guys? What's up? Uh Val.
Julia (as Val): Yeah?
Eric (as Dez): Hey what's up.
Julia (as Val): Hey what's up?
Eric (as Dez): Hey. Alright okay well let's let's pull some trees, alright let's get—let's get working.
Eric: Alright so the way this is working, I did send you all an agenda for this meeting this is Delta Stratagem Meeting #5. So let's assume that you've had four more of these meetings before over the last few months. January is going to lead the meeting, January has a MacBook Pro, that they're working— that they're working from now—
Brandon: Eric important question, did Dr. Morrow retrofit the MacBook Pro where instead of an apple on the front cover, it's a carrot?
Eric: Honestly though you could just buy that shit on Etsy man.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Valid.
Eric (as January): Alright uh, good morning it's really uh it's nice to see all of you. I know we've had a lot of progress over the last few months, and uh I'm really excited to be able to talk about all this stuff. So good morning let's just whip around the table, and we'll talk about something uh interesting or funny that happened to you this morning. I look really cute holding a carrot juice and uh well it already has 150 likes on my Instagram so pretty sick.
Julia: January has his own Instagram oh my god!
Eric: Oh yeah 100%
Brandon (as Milo): Did you like the ginger this time? I tried or what do you prefer like the spice from last time?
Eric (as January): Oh no yeah ginger is good listen with the carrot juice because you know when something gets juiced it's just like kind of sweet because you need the ginger to balance it out. So the carrot ginger is best so this is good.
Brandon (as Milo): Perfect love it.
Eric (as January): That's true, I'm glad that you've moved from getting me beet juice, to carrot juice, and then carrot orange juice which is trash ,and now it's just carrot juice so thank you Milo. Okay so let's just go around the room oh Milo, what do you got? What happened to you this morning, anything fun?
Brandon (as Milo): Uh well I got up, and you know I got dressed, and stuff and I went on the— I took the sky tram here and um, you know there's this like—like really weird person on on the skytram that was just like you know like a hanging out, and like like Tuna and I were like “what?” you know? It was weird.
[Beat of silence]
Julia (as Val): What?
Eric (as January): Great, nice. Great—
Brandon (as Milo): Okay but people on the skytram—
Eric (as January): Let's keep getting as an introductory thing just choose one thing let's just keep whipping around alright Val!
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): Uh I I walked some dogs this morning, um and a couple of them got into a tussle,
[Brandon gasps]
Julia (as Val): But then they made up and it was very sweet.
Brandon: Oh good, thank god.
Eric: That's good.
Eric (as January): Uh Aggie, what happened to you?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah my cat Sushi is not allowed in the bed, but uh this morning when I went to the bathroom and came back uh she had tucked herself into the bed and it was too cute so I did not stop her it's more of a confession—
Brandon (as Milo): But do you— do you have a photo? That was adorable.
Amanda (as Aggie): I do.
Brandon (as Milo): [Under his breath] Aw yes.
Amanda: And I shared the photo.
Amanda (as Aggie): Is this the kind of thing people put on Instagram?
Julia (as Val): Yes, yes!
Brandon (as Milo): I think yeah I think so yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): I might have to make one to follow January, if that's okay with you, I don't know what the protocol is, I have to ask permission. But I would like that very much.
Eric (as January): No you don't, you can just do it no that sounds great.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay.
Julia (as Val): You could probably just make an Instagram for your cat, that would be extremely cute as well.
Brandon (as Milo): If you did an Instagram where it was just your cat in bed like tucked in every time, that would do very well.
Amanda (as Aggie): She does not need more excuses to think she is the head of our household.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as January): Now just suggestion—
Julia (as Val): Are just concerned that fame would go to her head?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yes, extremely.
Eric (as January): Say sushirolled is a— could work?
Julia (as Val): Hah!
Brandon (as Milo): Oh that’s good. Yeah!
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh on the other hand it is a plan, I'm gonna have to think about this one.
Eric (as Dez): Um this morning they gave me a doughnut with my coffee that I wasn't expecting, and that was pretty cool.
Julia (as Val): What kind of doughnut Dez?
Eric (as Dez): Oh yeah it was like cream filled.
[Brandon ooo’s]
Julia (as Val): Oh fucking tight!
Eric (as Dez): It was tight.
Brandon (as Milo): Nice nice.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I discovered the relationship between electrons! It was a new one, didn't know![Amanda laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): Whoa! That’s uh—
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah! Pretty— just wanted I—I guess I can't really get into it, but I hope— I hope your enthusiasm is still good.
Amanda (as Aggie): They don't just like ping around in there against each other?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You know you'd think they were like ping-pong balls, but really they're more like uh koosh balls you know that Rosie O'Donnell on her talk show would throw around they kind of land with a soft thud, and not just like ping off it's it's uh I'm calling it the “koosh theorem”
Brandon (as Milo): I don't think I've ever done a single productive thing before like 3:00 P.M. that's very impressive.
Julia (as Val): You have a job. Like a regular job.
Brandon (as Milo): Have you seen me at my job, Val?
Julia (as Val): No because why would I go to a science museum?
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Milo I can help you with this, I'm very much a morning person, I would love to help you!
Brandon (as Milo): Do you have like a limitless pill or something that I could have?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Have is such a strange word—
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Let's—let's move on! Okay uh January what do we have first on the docket?
Eric (as January): Okay so the first thing uh I had was under recent Donnie Brooks uh just list scraps general uh fights that you have all came into. I think it's worth kind of reviewing and figuring out how you did and if there's any follow-up here. So Dr. Morrow why don’t you take it away?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Uh yeah so let's do some follow-up here uh we have the Sommelier which has happened recently, how did all that go for you three?
Julia (as Val): Pretty good though I think we need like to give money to SUNY Lake Town City because Aggie did kind of blow up their football stadium.
Amanda (as Aggie): It um… it was a necessary casualty, I mean it— if we'd gotten there five minutes later there would have exploded a building, people would have been killed it was a little too close for comfort in my opinion.
Julia (as Val): Oh I'm not doubting the the choice that was made there, I'm just saying like we did do kind of structural damage to the campus, and I think that maybe the town could help them out a little bit.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh no totally, it's more this is kind of further down the agenda but I— that one was a little close for me, and um I I'm wondering if there's any kind of uh— I don't want to get ahead of myself. Sorry January I just— I'll—we'll—I'll talk about it later.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well I to that point I did hear from the the chancellor of the SUNY system and they were not happy that their football stadium had a big old hole in it, and they did ask for funds to repair it ,which is fine and I said but they you know it was a little heated the football players all did kind of a sit-in in the cafeteria to protest that. So they yeah— they weren't they ever weren't happy.
Brandon (as Milo): How do we know they weren't just like eating lunch? Like what's the difference between a sit-in, and like lunch?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well they said “what do we want? A full field. When do we want it? Now.” And they weren't eating lunch, I think that was the way to tell the difference.
Brandon (as Milo): That sounds right.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah uh but I listen I'm glad it was taken care of it seems that uh Val you got some punches in you know villains will put you in that type of situation and it's just you know it's difficult, it's difficult. I understand but I think that from the outside people do see it like this and it is something that we need to start keeping in mind. But well I guess we'll talk about that a little bit later, um next we have the Emperor uh—
Eric: January speaks up and says
Eric (as January): I have notes from you uh Val said “hey fuck this guy” and then Val also said “remember when Milo reanimated a bunch of Thanksgiving turkeys to fight this guy?”
Julia (as Val): Yeah that sucked!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah that was really good I liked that one a lot, I had a lot of fun.
Julia (as Val): That sucked so bad I still have dreams about that, and they're not pleasant.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Brandon can you please roll a stealth check and I'll give you +3 to see how well the secret government covered up this entire situation.
Brandon: Well I did roll a 5 +3 is an 8.
Eric: Wonderful okay.
Amanda: Oh boy.
Julia: That’s phenomenal!
Eric: So yeah Dr. Morrow says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yo Milo it's funny that you said that was great, because you know what wasn't great, is the deep government conspiracy that the turkey people are now coming to attack Lake Town City that is all over reddit, and some state representatives are now looking into. It's actually not super great.
Brandon (as Milo): I mean look, was I supposed to like not animate the turkeys when I had the chance to?
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): YES.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Y E S!
Brandon (as Milo): Okay note taken, note taken.
Amanda (as Aggie): We'll have to open like a zoo of animals Milo created at this point, if it goes any further.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh that sounds fun!
Julia (as Val): No it is not.
Amanda (as Aggie): No it's not.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No it's not! Milo you seem to have the wrong impression of what the right thing to do here is. Being cool a good superhero is good, creating more fodder for conspiracy theorists is bad!
Julia (as Val): Bad! Very bad!
Brandon (as Milo): Okay writing it down.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Please write it down! Luckily the office of technology assessment is working on it, and we're—and we're pushing down on it but this wasn't so— disappeared as we thought it was, um we'll we'll look into that um the Emperor is still of course at large. We've checked all of the uh of the colleges and universities in the northeast that has an Asian studies department which is mostly populated by white people, we're still not on his tail we'll find him soon enough. Uh Crime Jam seems to be taken care of, I think that they're off uh former Vice President Al Gore is still happy with this and said very nice things about you Aggie, so that's still that seems to be okay.
[Amanda gasps]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I just have the man with the tablet Val punched at the ice rink, I do not remember his name but he is firmly in jail so that's fine, good job.
Julia (as Val): It was like Professor Magnetism or something like that?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Something like that.
Julia (as Val): Like it sounds really nerdy.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah he's just he's booked, so that's taken care of um the last two are or I do have some updates on the Nephews seem to be dispersed, ever since their supply lines have been kind of cut off. What we we did understand and after having Ma in talking to Ma and before her uh mech suit shut down, and blocking all of us out we were able to figure out, and confirm the existence of some sort of group called the People's River it seems like they were the ones supplying technology to the Nephews. So all of those things you know with the fins, and the chrome, that was from the People's River. We don't know much more than that you know because she did shut down and she's kind of in a walk-in freezer of her own demise. But hopefully maybe she'll she'll open back up, and we're getting her the medical attention so she doesn't need to just be in the frozen mech. So keep an ear out about the people's river if you hear anything about that or some— I don't know they seem to be like really scary hippies, so keep an eye out for that like a hippie holding a laser gun just look out for that.
Amanda (as Aggie): All hippies are scary.
Julia (as Val): Well as the boomers always say there's nothing scarier than a hippie.
[Brandon and Eric laughing]
Eric: Nothing is scarier than someone with flowers in their hair, and a laser gun in their hand.
Amanda: Truly.
Julia: Mhm. It's really the dichotomy of it.
Eric: It’s the—[laughing]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): The last thing here I have is Gutenberg again I still have a question mark here, so again just keep your eyes out. I still have the box they’re still the box is still creating the bombs and exploding into pixels. I've tried to analyze them they seem to be 18 and 16 bit pixels it's very strange it's something it's like if you take a Super Nintendo and you put it in the real in real life it's very strange. I guess what I'm worried about is Gutenberg and we still don't know anything about him, or other than the fact that he hates me and all the stuff that I do. Is um you know he he seemed to be watching me, were you— do— have you felt like you're being watched or anything like that?
Amanda (as Aggie): I uh I did. I don't know if this is really relevant but I— um my sister is really famous, I mean several of them are. But my sister Quinn is like an actor, and we were in the House Warehouse the other day getting her a dishwasher, how she buys in a condo with no appliances we'll talk about another time. But—
Eric (as Dez): Was it the uh the House Warehouse in the hipster one, or was the one like in the suburbs out at Weston? Because the Westin one is choice.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh definitely the Westin.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, you gotta do the Westin one.
Amanda (as Aggie): Um and I—I did— I did feel that, I felt that um that I was being watched, and it it was uh I don't like feelings. This was a real one um
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): And there ended up being a bunch of people who recognized Quinn, I don't know how they got there if someone called them, or if they were really threatening us. But separately there was definitely some kind of surveillance that I was under someone following me in some capacity. I shook them eventually but I didn't expect that and I will next time.
[Collective hmmms]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Interesting.
Brandon (as Milo): I don't like that.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah. Is Quinn— uh you know maybe you should— why don't you bring Quinn by in our uh, when we have our next meeting? I think that might be for the best we can ask her see if there's anything that she sees, she might be able to distinguish bad people from good people if she is a celebrity. It's kind of like innate in her. Can she uh—can she do anything?
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh yeah she gets herself in uh
Amanda: And then Aggie has like a dumb smile on her face.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sticky situations. Um sorry that's not really helpful for you. Yes she has sort of goo powers, and can stick to walls.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh so she can shoot goo out of her face or chest?
Brandon (as Milo): Goo? What?!
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh no it's it's um palms it's sort of a Spider-Man situation um but less um less uh stringy. It's more like a nest and less of a web? She can explain it better.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay—
Brandon (as Milo): Your sibling is Spider-man?!
Julia (as Val): That's pretty cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): No no she is just an actor.
Brandon (as Milo): [Sadly] Oh okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): So I mean maybe she'll play Spider-Man at some point. They're doing lots of you know uh outside of traditional gender castings which I think is uh great, but um yeah no not not yet.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh okay um she sounds interesting, maybe we can see if she's more of a climber, and less of a flubber and go from there. I also want you to know I find Flubber to be offensive to scientists, just the thing I wanted to share.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia (as Val): That's important.
Amanda (as Aggie): But um she she's filming soon but all she's still in town right now for the holidays, so I'll um I'll see if she's available.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Great great.
Julia (as Val): Are we just gonna be like “hey come to the mayor's house uh for our superhero squad meeting!” Just to clarify what pretense I am going to have to come into that meeting with.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh no sure, I um I think she'd be pretty flattered if Mayor Dr. Morrow wanted to meet her, and also she just really likes houses, and being places she shouldn't be so I think that being able to—
[Brandon laughing]
Julia (as Val): I understand that feeling.
Amanda (as Aggie): Visit this house would be reason enough.
Julia (as Val): Alright.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Good good! Okay—
Amanda (as Aggie): It's worth, sorry I don't—I don't know if I've said this before, but I mean all of my siblings to one extent or another can you know, they're one of us. So when that article came out a while ago, that's why I was so freaked out um because it's not wrong.
Brandon (as Milo): I mean how many siblings do you have?
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm oldest of seven.
Brandon (as Milo): Seven?!
Julia (as Val): That’s so many!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): What are— what are their names?
Brandon (as Milo): Do we know any of them?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah well there's Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, and Quinn. Danny is a painter, Cassie is a she's like very famous on the Instagram that's why I haven't really been on it yet, I don't want to see any of her goings on, she lives mostly in Berlin, sometimes in Canada it's complicated. Regan she's a musician, Regan O’Hare—
Brandon (as Milo): Oh yeah!
Amanda (as Aggie): Um and and Ryan—
Brandon (as Milo): I have heard of Regan!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah and um she had a collab with Kacey Musgraves recently. It was really good.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah!
Amanda (as Aggie): And Ryan is a swimmer, and a snowboarder um you probably— he has some kind of endorsement deal with with G-Fuel the the sports drink—
Julia (as Val): Oh like the Gatorade, I got you.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah yeah, he really shreds
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh on the waves or the slopes?
Eric (as Dez): Oh, both.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah he agrees. Kelly is a model, she's on those—the conditioner at the CVS, um and but she has other kinds of modeling but that's why those people know her mostly. And then yeah uh Quinn, um she just did a stint on Broadway but mostly the the movies and such. And uh yeah all them have powers that none of them are subtle about.
Eric: I feel like when Quinn was on RuPaul's Drag Race it's like “Quinn O'Hare you really hopped into my life!” And then she's like “Oh Ru, you can show me the carrot or the stick!” And then everyone laughed, and everyone laughed.
Julia: Jesus.
Eric (as January): Actually that does take us really nicely into our next section, kind of building off of everything we just said. Let's talk about public opinion, again a part of this whole superhero thing is we do need to think about how other people see us, when we're in our costumes, so I guess the first thing let's start with the Average Bear follow up. Aggie did you—have you followed talked to Tegan I guess if you have there been any sort of uh follow-up from that? Did you have you seen anything change?
Amanda (as Aggie): Um yeah, they've asked me for comment on a bunch of articles about Lake Town City none of which were about powers. But I just did not read them, I mean I read them a lot but I didn't I didn't respond, so uh no.
Julia (as Val): Did you have like a thing for this person or am I misremembering another person with a teal jacket?
Amanda (as Aggie): Should we talk about Hatomi, Val?
Julia (as Val): We can!
Amanda (as Aggie): Or are we bringing all this up right now? Yeah how are things going I really hope you guys succeed.
Julia (as Val): Really, really good we— she showed me a lot of anime, I like the Naruto.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: [Mimicking Val] I think I'm kind of a Sasuke when you think about it.
Julia: I don't know if I'm a Sasuke okay?
Brandon: Milo squeals a little bit in happiness for both of you.
Julia (as Val): Thank you.
Eric: Also Aggie you and a few of your different siblings have gotten contacted about different outlets that have tried to run with this superhero story. You know kind of like in November and in early December, there was kind of a there was now interest especially in your particular family Ryan has taken all of the interviews and said equally dumb quotes every single time, but Quinn Quinn has kind of locked everyone down, and Danny painted like a canvas that was all black except for like a little white paint that just says “no” with a period. And sends a photo of that to just every every reporter—
Brandon: That’s very good.
Julia: Can I have a print of that?
Eric: So that's been published like a bunch of times.
Amanda: Yeah it's it's hanging in my bathroom, I can get a high-res copy for you.
Eric: So it's it has been consistent, I think people are are kind of looking in to the O'Hares as we've talked about about how your parents continue to travel on holiday, they sent like an email to everybody was like “hey we're going to India we're going to be on an Ashram, no service for four weeks sorry.” So they're just like not able to be contacted at all.
Amanda: Yeah no classic, it hurts deep inside even though I'm 30. Mhm.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Oh boy.
Eric: Dr. Morrow pipes up and says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I didn't try to reach out to the Lake Town City offices of Average Bear to kind of do some supporting research; they did not care about me. But Aggie if you do want to go in there and do like a video of something, maybe we can try to work it out and finesse it maybe if you want to go in as a superhero, we could we could figure that out, but we we will need to give them like— every action has an opposite and equal reaction do you know what I'm saying?
Amanda (as Aggie): So why would I put more actions into stoking the fire of people's interest? I am fine with them knowing about the Preserver but they cannot know anything about my family.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No that's why I meant you can do it either as Aggie or as the Preserver that's what I'm saying.
Amanda (as Aggie): What would the upside be?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): They stop talking about the O'Hares and started talking about the Preserver, and Vulcani, and Kilonova. I understand— I'm not telling you you have to do this, I'm saying it's an option for us to consider if we want them to stop looking into the O'Hares.
Amanda (as Aggie): [Sighs] I mean if I were to reach out to Tegan and say that they could write whatever they wanted about the Preserver, as long as they never mentioned the O'Hares again, would that help? Would that hurt? I have no idea.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): well it you can do it directly with Tegan if you're able to make that lie stick, and be like “oh my friend the Preserver” if you'd be able to get that to work. I'm just saying you can do it with somebody else in Average Bear there are a lot of different options, I just want you to think about it.
Julia (as Val): Yeah I was gonna suggest if you want to go with the Average Bear article, you don't have to do it either me or Milo could just be superheroes you know? We already are, I don't know if you want Milo doing it actually.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey!
[Beat of pause]
Brandon (as Milo): That's fair. Would we like leak them some like photos or like grainy footage of like stuff that's like exclusive to them? Maybe that changed the story that way?
Amanda (as Aggie): I think it would be a good idea for them to write about us as a unit, and I mean they're really good writer, I just yeah I was reading all of their other columns— okay um I—
Brandon (as Milo): Cute!
Amanda (as Aggie): I think that I should just be honest.
Julia (as Val): About what though?
Amanda (as Aggie): I know it's I know it's high risk, but if I were to say who I am then they wouldn't— they're gonna find out you know and if I just say it, and they're a journalist and and true about their ethics, then they can't reveal me right?
Julia (as Val): No, no sorry they they do write for a website, I this is not the New York Times.
Amanda (as Aggie): But if they are the beat reporter for our group, then why would they go back on their word?
Brandon (as Milo): You're also putting them at a risk if anyone who wants to get to us, might go through them you know?
Eric (as Dez): I think what you're trying to do is seems like the right thing to do for you, but there's a reason why we you put on the mask like you just lean into that. Also uh don't— yeah don't do that. You don't have to you don't have to throw yourself in front of that truck, it's just not worth it.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay I will take romantic advice from you Dez, I will.
[Transition note]
Amanda: Now I know Eric goes hard for heirloom tomato season, but to me the beginning of September is all about fall flowers. It sounds extremely minor, but when I see mums planted in flower boxes, and kind of autumnal and orange and yellow and red flowers and leaves decorations start to go up in my neighborhood, I know that it is peak Amanda weather. You get to wear sweaters, you get to wear leggings, you get to put on high boots and feel like you're about to jump on a horse any minute. It is a fantastic time of year and I will take any excuse I can to be a little bit more excited about my day. This is the midroll, it's time to break out your scarves!

[Transition note]
[Faint crackling of wood in a fireplace]
Eric: I wanted to kind of fill in the fame component here that we talked about a little while ago, and I want to kind of fill in some stuff that maybe that happened over the last few months uh to see how you're all doing here. We did talk about the fame modifier a little bit but I did actually lay this out and I think that the same modifier is going to be plus or minus depending on how you were doing during your general entanglements, and how much people like you because of the things that have happened during this campaign. I think it's kind of running, I'll keep track of it and uh there will be modifiers for your performance roles that you'll do because it's how other people see you as a superhero.
Brandon: Cool, love it.
Eric: I also have a bunch of questions here so this is a little bit powered by the apocalypse, like there are failures, there are mixed successes, there are successes, and great successes here. I'll have a bunch of questions here, and you can kind of tell me what situation happened here. So right now your fame modifier Aggie has a 0 because uh both of your your entanglement with Crime Jam was kind of a push, and so was the scrap with the football people were kind of a push. Val has +1 because of how handily you crushed the guy with the tablet, and you were the one doing the most damage during the Sommelier fight, and Milo because of the stealth role of the government, and they didn't do that well covering it up I did give you -1.
Brandon: Yeah that makes sense.
Eric: Yeah uh so let's go around the table as January says
Eric (as January): Okay but let's do a quick audit about I guess how Lake Town City is seeing all of you.
Eric: So does anyone want to go first?
Brandon: Uh let's just get the bad news out of the way first I guess.
[Julia and Amanda laugh]
Eric: Okay so Brandon I want you to make a performance roll, and then -1.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 3 -1 for 2.
[Eric makes disgusted noises]
Julia: Geeze, bud.
Amanda: Oh buddy.
Eric: Okay so I have a few different prompts that I want you to follow through on, that could have happened over the last month or so. It either is related to something that did happen on mic already, or not.
Brandon: Cool.
Eric: So the questions I have for you are what did you ruin for the public that was actually for the greater good? What fight did you back away from even though it was the right move? What neighborhood did you piss off? Why and how? What powerful person did you annoy? Why and how? Or just generally what did you mess up?
Brandon: And do I answer all of them or just one?
Eric: No just pick one.
Brandon: So what neighborhood did I piss off and why and how? I think Milo would probably would have pissed off Thornhill because he's a die-hard company town man, and so you know he probably would have made some offhand comment to like a news reporter, or like maybe he said it like a jape to Aggie or Val while they were on the scene and a nurse reporter caught it on camera, or on audio or something.
Eric: I love the idea that this was like after something you were cleaning up, maybe you were just like stopping some bank robbers or something and there's like a reporter ran up to you and was like uh
Eric (as reporter): Applejack Simmons 7 ½ News! Kilonova, you've done so much good here in the city, what is your favorite place where it is your favorite place to be uh in Lake Town? In Lake Town City?
Brandon (as Milo as Kilonova): Um [clearing throat and deepens voice] Uh I really like [clears throat] I really like Astros a lot like they— uh they they got a really good drink special, um but like you know like the good Astros. Not like not like the one in Thornhill like the real Astros you know?
Julia: Hoooooo. Burn.
Eric: Amazing, I love that yeah. And then immediately there's like a flurry of like “which Astros is best?” Is like the meme in the city for a week, and there's like rankings and stuff, and the Thornhill Astros it was like “listen if a villain came into Astros and blew up all of our drinks, and bowling balls, we still don't want Kilonova coming here and saving us”
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Damn.
Eric: There must be a black hole in his heart, got him!
Julia: Ooohh, snapped.
Eric: Amazing so January then says
Eric (as January): Uh Milo we do need you to apologize to the Thornhill Astros. We know you love Astros but each one is independently owned it's kind of like a franchise situation, so like they we can't just like talk to Astros corporate, you do need to go there and figure it out.
Brandon (as Milo): [Groans for a few seconds] Fine.
[Julia laughs]
Eric (as January): Thank you Milo we really need you to do this please.
Brandon (as Milo): Do I do like a photo off with like a bowling ball like drinking a bowling ball? Like a thumbs up or like—
Eric (as January): Yeah listen these are the things you do anyway, just do it at the hipster one.
Julia (as Val): And you know, in costume. Don't just go by yourself because that's not gonna do anything.
Amanda (as Aggie): True.
Julia: Yeah—
Eric (as January): And tip really well!
Julia (as Val): At least 30%
Amanda (as Aggie): Like 50%
Brandon (as Milo): Can I borrow some cash then?
Eric (as January): Yes you could take it, you could take it from the apology jar.
[Everyone laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Thank you, thank you.
Eric: Alright who wants to go next?
Julia: I'll go!
Eric: Okay so Julia you have a +1 and then do your performance.
Julia: Is it +1 to what my modifier for my performance is already?
Eric: Yes this is your fame modifier.
Julia: Okay so it would be +3!
Brandon: Um importantly I forgot to take into account my performance modifier as well, So I did get a 1 and not a 2.
Julia: Oh boy!
Eric: Beautiful wonderful!
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Okay uh it's a 13 +3.
Eric: Hell yeah 16 that is a success!
Julia: Boom boom!
Eric: So I have some questions for you Val.
Julia: What's up?
Eric: What did you do to succeed at universal appeal? What did you fix that everyone was annoyed that wasn't fixed? Who did you defeat either literally or metaphorically, or on the internet, that made a splash on the internet? To which established hero or celebrity are people comparing you to favorably? Or which internet influencer captured a sick move of yours and is a fervent fan?
Julia: So I'm gonna go with which internet influencer captured your sick move and is now a big fan, and I think it's not even like someone super important, but it's like a really popular tumblr page, and so now there's a bunch of like spin-off tumblrs about like f-yeah-Vulcani and Vulcani-fan-page and stuff like that. There's a lot of grainy grainy gifts of me just like fighting bad guys.
Amanda: I think cassie has probably done a Vulcani tattoo by now on somebody.
Julia: Oh hell yeah let me see it!
Eric: I like that I love that tumblr is reviving in Lake Town City just for Val now.
Julia: Yeah, for sure!
Eric: What was the big tumblr or big influencer it can be over all like who is that person that really kicked it off?
Julia: Oh I want to say it's like it's a tumblr user which is ironic because Val had never heard of them before this, but it's a goldensknight is their tumblr username, and they run a bunch of like vigilante heroes across the United States tumblr, that like has a very niche following.
Eric:I like that, I also think that if it's a tumblr it also got like aggregated on twitter and Instagram and reddit, so now it's like you're everywhere just from this one post.
Julia: Cause that's how the internet works.
Eric: I love that lots of people are bringing back the leather jacket, and push-up sleeves it's all happening. Alright Aggie let's see it so you have just a 0 and then plus your performance.
Amanda: Which is also 0.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 5.
Julia: Oh boy gang, ooh boy gang.
Brandon: Oh no.
Eric: Alright so you're gonna have that you have the same fails, what did you ruin for the public that was actually for the greater good? What fight did you back away from even though it was the right move? What neighborhood did you piss off? Why and how? What powerful person did you annoy? Why and how? And just generally what did you mess up? You can make up something new, or this can be related to Crime Jam or the Sommelier thing.
Amanda: Okay so I definitely annoyed a powerful person, and I think that the fathers of one of the like starters on the football team whose stadium was blown up is also a like city council person, and has been a voice for dissent about vigilantism in the city council.
Eric: Oh I like that you want to name this person?
Amanda: Julia can I delegate you to name this person?
Julia: Rich Burdock.
Amanda: [Laughing] How are you so good at this Julia?
Julia: I don’t know, that one just popped into my head, I'm like that feels right.
Eric: The starting quarterback is Rick Burdock but he's Richard Burdock Jr. but everyone just calls him Rick.
Amanda: And Councilman Burdock is like “when you get your heisman, it's going to say Richard Burdock Jr. I don't care what you say”
Eric: I love that yeah Councilman Burdock is definitely coming down hard on it. It does seem like the other coming down hard on you particularly and this group and the Knight of Mirrors I do think that there is a kind of like right way to act sort of thing that's happening without country uh avengers it's very just like
Eric (as Councilman Burdock): If people could just act like Emily Slaughter and connect with everything that's already happening in Lake Town City, we wouldn't have this vigilante problem! It would be a powered superhero force which is better, and more attuned to what we already understand in this city!
[Everyone groans]
Brandon: Um at one point during one of the city council meetings Milo shows up in ghost form and just boo’s this guy from the back.
Eric (as Councilman Burdock): Can someone please close the window? The window is open and people are booing me, this is a court of order and I do not— I do not appreciate people booing me in my place of occupations!
Eric: So now let's go back to the the meeting January says
Eric (as January): Yeah Milo, Aggie, I don't know how you managed to get people mad at you, but I guess we just need to take some steps to get people less mad at you, especially a city council person is not the person to have on your side. Especially if they see you Aggie out of costume nearly every single meeting.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah it's really awkward for me, we used to at least be able to like pass each other a stapler or a piece of paper, and now I can't barely do that without sweating so much I dropped the pen okay?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as January): Well maybe if we get them on their side, if we get some some better press, I don't know, what Val's doing! Eat more pizza, swear I—I'm not really sure just follow Val's lead.
Julia (as Val): I would like everyone just one second to take a pause in the meeting, and give me your best “fuck word”
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): Let's all try it, because clearly it's working for me!
[Beat of silence]
Amanda (as Aggie): Piss.
[Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): Okay Milo?
Brandon (as Milo): Uh j-j-jerk face?
Julia (as Val): Nope try again!
Eric (as January): FUCK!
Julia (as Val): Thank you January, see January knows how to do it. If the adorable rabbit can do it, you can do it.
Brandon (as Milo): I'll work on it.
Julia (as Val): We’ll work on it, I just need you to show me you're trying!
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Eric: Dez says
Eric (as Dez): Motherfuck.
Julia (as Val): Veautiful Dez.
Eric (as Dez): Thank you.
Amanda (as Aggie): That’s a good one.
Eric: Dr. Morrow says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Let's stop swearing, like we can move on. I don't think the swearing is what people like about Val. I think it might be more of you just mean it will be confident in what we do, and also stay rational. Let's not do things that could create more of a problem, let's just keep keep moving forward, and let's all be nice—
Brandon (as Milo): [Gasps] I have an idea!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Sure, yes Milo?
Brandon (as Milo): Could we get the council person to come to Val's pizza restaurant, and then somehow show them eating a pizza with a knife and fork, and just smear campaign.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I will 100% work on that, more people eat with a knife and fork in Lake Town City than I can abide by.
Julia (as Val): Yes, it’s unacceptable.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): But let's focus on us first before setting up other people okay?
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, so I mean next time I am trying to get rid of a live bomb in a densely populated campus, what do you suggest that I do? Can we for example make a— I don't know neutralizing box that I could dump it in?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah no that's a great idea, I will— we'll do it we're still working on this. like I haven't— I haven't had time— Dez and I haven't had time to put all this stuff together necessarily, so this is this will be a good time to do it yes neutralizing box we'll I'll get on that. I guess Aggie do you have choices about where to throw the bomb?
Amanda (as Aggie): It was either that or a forest where I had very poor visibility, and I know students go to kiss and other things.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's no it's a tough— it's a tough choice, it's listen I'm not saying that anyone what anyone's doing is wrong except for Milo, don't have turkeys run around that that was actually—
Brandon (as Milo): Oh come on!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No, no I think we've established that was a bad choice. But it's more about how other people see you. We'll get some initiatives going, we'll get you some better buzz but just something to consider to make people to make people like you. Because god damn Emily's, go to the next one! Goddamn Emily Slaughter is sweeping up all the goodwill that I thought that we would all be able to do and I hate it!
Brandon (as Milo): I'll fight em. Do you want to fight em? Let’s fight em.
Amanda (as Aggie): We hate her too.
Julia (as Val): Superhero fight, hell yes I'm here!
Brandon (as Milo): Yes!
Eric (as January): No I do not think superhero fight. Again we're just giving people more fodder to say bad things about everybody, that would be bad!
Amanda (as Aggie): I feel kind of bad about what do they say? Ghosting her, so maybe I could have coffee with her or something, or Milo do you have any nerd shit that she wants to buy on ebay?
Brandon (as MIlp): Uh what did she buy— she bought the science key last time, so let me, I'll look at her history, and Dr. Morrow you might have some like interesting you know benign artifacts that we could oh yeah you know bibe her with.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah I have a whole closet of benign weapons we could use that I sound great!
Julia (as Val): Well that seems contradictory benign weapons.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: That's why they go in the closet!
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh yeah I think that'll be a good idea and I can take this one guys, I know I haven't been pulling my weight in terms of the public opinion, and I wish we did not have to but I know that we do um so Dr. Morrow or or Dez if you have anything lying around that you think would be um is significant to Lake Town City history, I think that's why Emily was getting key. Hopefully otherwise big weapon issues probably that are going on that we don't know about.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Uh don’t I'll look into that um and then you know, hey if you talk to the night if you see the Knight of Mirrors can you just like ask them what what's going on? Cannot get a beat—
Brandon (as Milo): I've done that so many times, I'll fight that person too.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No, again no superhero flights is not what we need. Maybe like—
Brandon (as Milo): What about a drag race? Embarrass them.
Amanda (as Aggie): Or a closed-door meeting? I mean would it make sense for us to all get together and just talk about what we're doing?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): That could work kind of like a get all all powered people into a room, if you think that they trust you to do it I mean. A lot of you— it sounds like Emily already tried that with the whole warehouse thing, and you three were wary of me to start with. So getting all the powered people into a room might be a little difficult.
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't know if that specifically is a good idea now that I think about it let me let me try talking to Emily and then I'll report back and we'll see if we need to do something else. The Knight of Mirrors I mean it doesn't seem like a bad person, just sort of shows up and does their own thing, and like how did they get a motorcycle that cool? That's what I want to know.
Julia (as Val): It's a very cool motorcycle.
Brandon (as Milo): It's a fine motorcycle.
Julia (as Val): It's pretty cool, Milo you're a nerd, you should like that Tron shit.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as Dez): I can say on good authority, it's pretty dope, it's pretty cool.
Julia (as Val): Yeah see, even Dez agrees with me, and Dez knows exactly what's up with cool science shit!
Brandon (as Milo): Alright fine! It's cool, it's cool, it’s cool, it's fine!
Eric (as Dez): You can really separate the rider and and the ride, don't think that they're the same.
Amanda: [Laughing] More Dez, please!
Eric: Dr. Morrow says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): January, we don't need a name, we're skipping this one!
Julia (as Val): Yep, no we don't want to be named.
Brandon (as Milo): There was a good note on there, I think though?
Julia (as Val): Nope there was not I think there's a good note.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): The Unthwartable Three.
Julia (as Val): What is that?
Brandon (as Milo): What a good name!
Julia (as Val): No! Terrible!
Amanda (as Aggie): That is very hard to say.
Julia (as Val): You have to imagine a five-year-old trying to say it, and no five-year-old is going to be able to say unthwartable.
Brandon (as Milo): [In a childish voice] The Untwordable Twee!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): [Childish voice] The Unfwodable Fwee!
Brandon (as Milo): See that's adorable!
Julia (as Val): No, it’s terrible.
Amanda (as Aggie): That's cute but say that again Dr. Morrow, please.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): But I'm unfwodable! [Regular voice] No I don't like it, it's not—it's too much in the mouth of a babe I think. Preserver we've already we said yes on Preserver, unthwartable might be a little bit too much.
Brandon (as Milo): Fine.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): But we're never gonna have a team name, so it's fine! Great let's move on.
Julia (as Val): It's great!
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean if we're thinking about PR though, I think January has a point.
Eric (as January): Thank you! We just need something easy that everyone can refer to all of you about. We'll kick it around, just eventually you might need to sit down and just have like a massive brainstorm okay?
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): That sounds fun, let's do it! I'll bring the donuts, you bring the coffee let's go!
Eric (as January): Alright great! Well I'll put it on the calendar.
Eric (as Dez): Is it— can I do my thing?
Julia (as Val): Yes Dez time! The best part of these meetings!
Eric: So Dez stands up, and pulls like readers out of his pocket, and puts them on, and is holding up the yellow pad.
Amanda (as Aggie): Dez, man you really pull that off. Just gotta say!
Eric (as Dez): Thanks I can uh, my superpower is being pretty fly. Uh so—
Julia (as Val): Yeah it is!
Brandon (as Milo): That's true, hell yeah!
Eric (as Dez): Oh thanks thanks everybody. Um so you know I've been looking over your reports, and everything and I haven't had the chance to really build something that you have asked me for. So I think that we're finally getting the point where I understand do you— are there things that you think you need out in the field that can maybe help your persona? Or your brand? But also just like functionally, what are things that you think might need, that I can get for you?
Julia (as Val): Well okay, so I'm named after a volcano, so what I'm thinking would make me look more awesome and also be on brand is like being able to punch so hard it flames up, and I can do fire things like like Falcon punch you know? Super Smash Brothers?
Eric (as Dez): Yeah from Super Smash Brothers, got it yeah Falcon Punch, okay.
Eric: And he writes down falcon punch, Val falcon punch.
Brandon (as Milo): Uh like if— if we could make something whether it's just like a visual effect, or whatever. But like either like two like infinitely black items, like circle me, and circle me until they collide, and then I disappear that be a cool effect. Or do the same thing to an enemy but, that would be like a weapon you know?
Eric (as Dez): Oh okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Because my name is Kilonova, that's what it's like two black hole— two neutron stars colliding, and should be like a really cool like PR move?
Eric (as Dez): Do you think that— do does all the power need to come from the the things, or do you think that you can like get some ghost stuff to like keep that going? And use that.
Brandon (as Milo): I think you could probably get some ghost juice.
Eric (as Dez): Okay. Cool, cool, cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): [Groans] Oh please no.
Julia (as Val): Ugh I hate that phrase.
Brandon (as Milo): Some ghost ectoplasm?
Julia (as Val): Uhh better?
Eric (as Dez): Cooler, ecto cooler.
Amanda (as Aggie): Energy, we know what you're talking about.
Eric (as Dez): Okay if we can get it ghost powered, I might be able to think of something yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): And um I like Val, the brand acknowledgement I'm trying not to get a rash when I think of that word anymore, um I would like to be able to assist not from the middle of the fight. And I think that in terms of preserving, maybe a sort of paralyzing effect, maybe something to help neutralize whether it's an electrical device, or a person and to freeze them for a little bit I feel would help reduce the damage that the enemies can do, while giving us a chance to get them into custody.
Eric: At that point when you say “neutralize” Dez looks up at Dr. Morrow, and Dr. Morrow gives like a small nod, and Dez says
Eric (as Dez): Yeah you know, I think we do have something that can help you with that. Yeah I like that.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay cool.
Eric (as Dez): Cool, also just like about the gum, and the buster, and the contacts, those you— I have a bunch of those, and I can give them back to you once you use them. So like feel free to do it, they do break down because they're kind of like prototypes, but I have a few of them and as long as you give me some time to rummage around in the back. I'll be able to grab them for you.
Julia (as Val): Oh hell yeah!
Brandon (as Milo): Perfect.
Eric (as Dez): Cool alright that's all I have, thank you.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks, Dez!
Eric (as Dez): Dez time is over.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh come on, can we go back?
Eric (as Dez): We'll have more Dez time you listen once you uh, once we can go to all of the Astros again. I think that we'll be able to— we can move Dez time to a few different places.
Brandon (as Milo): Alright, I get it, I—I fucked up with the turkeys, I fucked up with the Astros, alright let's move on.
Eric (as Dez): Well like if you fix it, it's not about— Milo it's not about fucking up, it's about acknowledging our mistakes, and making them better, and then— or sometimes people then see you in a better light afterwards.
Brandon (as Milo): You're right, you know it does— you're really wise thanks. Oh and I found my fuck word!
Julia (as Val): There we go! Proud of you!
Eric: That's the secret word! January then says
Eric (as January): Alright so I guess that's the end of the meeting. Does anyone have anything they want to add here at the end I saw proton pack, Doug Navarro's working on it, phasers again also working on it—
Brandon (as Milo): Specifically anti— an anti-proton pack, like I don't want to get sucked up into a vacuum if that would be if possible. That would be a great thank you.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah that's the real problem, here's the thing the Ghostbusters stuff is real, but that would ruin Milo, so I was modifying that.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Ghostbusters actually uh based on a true story.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh!
Julia (as Val): Were you part of that? Hold on, were you part of that!?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well like in the all-female one, I was kind of the inspiration for Kate McKinnon there.
Julia (as Val): That makes sense.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh yeah! I see it.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I thought it was pretty cool, she's much funnier than I am. I can't pull off a lot of those jokes.
Brandon (as Milo): Noooooo.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's fine, it's fine. Anyway so—
Eric (as January): Aggie you did have a note here about patrols, do you think that can you expand on that?
Amanda (as Aggie): Um yeah, it's more like I feel like we have arrived after damage was done a lot of the time, and I hesitate to bring this up a little bit because I don't want to live in a you know surveillance state. But is there a way that we could improve our intelligence, or do some kind of patrol, or have a tip line if that wouldn't just be really chaotic. I would just— I'd like to get a jump on these guys from time to time, instead of arriving after they've already managed to you know destroy a bursar's office, and almost blow up the campus.
Brandon (as Milo): Smart.
Julia (as Val): Maybe we could have like a hashtag on Twitter.
Eric: Yeah we can definitely talk about this, I think Eric the DM here. I think that's a really good idea. I didn't ever give you more—
Brandon: Okay, Eric!
Amanda: Oh hi!
Eric: Oh hey what's up?
Amanda: It's been a really good episode!
Eric: Oh thank you!
Brandon: It’s been really fun so far!
Eric: I think this would give you all a really good opportunity to change your fame, if you are more aware and being able to get the jump on stuff. Because you know if you're only responding to like listening over police waves for example, like what the Knight of Mirrors is doing you do show up late in that kind of Batman sort of way. So if you do want to be on patrol, you will have more opportunities to save people, and then people might look at you differently. So we can get that going in between the next arc, you can set that up during downtime, and then see if that will improve your fame score. So I think that's a good idea.
Julia: Yeah. cool!
Brandon: Cool I like that idea.
Eric: Yeah okay cool Dr. Morrow stands up and says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay so we’re at the last one it’s training it's the reason why I called you all here let's go I'll go out to the back alright!
Eric: So Dr. Morrow throws open the glass door, and leads you out through her house to her backyard. Which as you might have seen before, looked like it was kind of all forest, and there's like a little worn path where she's kind of walked through, and she's cleared out into the forest and there's like a big rock over to one side, and she's like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Hey not a lot of people know this, but that's my thinking rock.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh yeah I know, I have one too! You just sit there and you think, and talk to the rock, and you know it's a moment of solace in a chaotic world.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah! And that's where I work out like all those big math problems that no one's really solved ever before. I got my nobel prize sitting on that rock
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): You guys just like sit down places and think?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Val do you not sit down and think?
Julia (as Val): I mean like, I think while I do things.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): Sometimes it's nice not to do things, you know?
Julia (as Val): I don't know what that's like.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): A great superhero team is about the diversity in it truly, we all come from different places.
Eric: So she leads you out into the forest, and there's just this little tool shed out there that's kind of the standing outbuilding seems pretty small no bigger than like a New York City apartment, you know?
Brandon: So it's 4x4.
Eric: Exactly, it's pretty small. So she opens the door and ushers you all inside.
Amanda: I will step gingerly over the threshold.
Eric: Amanda make a dexterity check, no I'm just— just kidding. I'm just kidding.
Amanda: You bastard.
Eric: Dr. Morrow turns on the lights and it's just these halogen lights from the ceiling, and you're standing in a pretty small room. But this does seem like a viewing station, because you're looking out onto two stories of just green screen through a double-sided mirror.
Amanda: What?!
Eric: And it's like this is like the press box, and you're looking down just on this massive sort of like green screened area. You know like in in the movies when they have the green screen, but there's like green screen on the floor and all of the walls to make sure that like everything is green screen. It's like this is a two-story, like basketball court sized green screen.
Amanda: Aggie exits and looks around the corner of the building to like square those two things.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): As a british man once took from me back in 1967—
Julia (as Val): Oh my god.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It’s larger on the inside.
[Julia laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): You. Know. Doctor. Who?! Doctor Who was real?!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Who? Welcome to the fun room, where we have fun, and we train. I wanted there to be a positive association here.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh boy.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah it seems not suspicious at all when you call it the “fun room”
Julia (as Val): Mhm.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay do we want another name? I thought fun was fun.
Brandon (as Milo): No it's good, let's let's keep going.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Do you not find honing your skills to a sharp point to use in dangerous situations not fun? I find that fun.
Julia (as Val): Oh no that is actually my definition of fun.
Amanda (as Aggie): Actually it's pretty fun, I like getting good at things.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You see exactly, I thought it was fun!
Brandon (as Milo): I play video games.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It seems similar but it's like you're in the video game ooooh!
Julia (as Val): It’s a VR experience!
Eric: So you see there's like a control panel inside of the double-sided window, she's like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well I built this thing kind of in my spare time because I felt like there were— you needed more opportunities, I guess as we were talking about to solve problems in the what kind of looks to other people in the best way possible. I know that we're not as organized as Emily Slaughter is, and we're not as cool and mysterious as the Knight of Mirrors is but I think that we can all kind of work together, and I want to use my brain power to help you out here. So uh we could take a— I would love it if you you three took a a run at the fun room, it's our inaugural voyage, and we can kind of start to train.
Amanda (as Aggie): Can we call the gym, maybe?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): The fun gym! The gym zone!
Julia (as Val): I like the gym zone actually, I'm kind of about that.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh lordy.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I like the gym zone it makes it sound like it's one of those like soft obstacle courses you did when you were four.
Julia (as Val): Yeah like the little gym, or whatever the fuck that were the kids go.
Amanda (as Aggie): Why don’t they have one for adults? I would go there every day!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I can program— I can make sure to program a ball pit into whatever we're doing no problem.
[Brandon ooo’s]
Julia (as Val): Thank you.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay let me just uh
Eric: She goes over to a computer that's inset in there, and types something in really quickly and says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright I'll make sure to put in the ball pit.
Eric: So I think you run the inaugural voyage, I think we should give this a shot!
Brandon (as Milo): Let's do it!
Julia (as Val): Let's do it!
Eric: Wouldn't that be fun?
Amanda: Alright.
Eric: Uh so there's a door over to the right side of this room, and then you see there's a rope ladder that leads you down into like the green screened area.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh it's underground! I should have known that. Do you have permits for this many underground dwellings? They're very close to each other.
Julia (as Val): She's the mayor, she can make permits for whatever she wants.
Amanda (as Aggie): True okay yep.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Thank you Val.
Amanda: And Aggie jumps down.
Brandon: Milo looks a little bit disappointed that it's not a Doctor Who thing.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: Dr. Morrow says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright, so I don't want you to do this alone, and don't worry I'll be able to talk to you.
Eric: So she closes the door and she turns out like a microphone like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): [Through the speakers] Son't worry I can give you clues here just in case you need anything, and I'll be sure to monitor all of this stuff. But I did want you to have kind of someone else to help you here!
Eric: So she hits a few buttons and it goes click and you hear like a whirring sound and in front of you just like kind of in in the green screen area, is a regular looking guy in front of you who has very shaggy hair, is wearing basketball shorts, and like a descrip script t-shirt, that says “go team” it's like—I don't know if any of you have played a sports game, but there's kind of just like a nondescript like team uniform you have.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah I envisioned Robin Williams and Mork and Mindy. Like really like chunky hair, and just kind of a goober looking guy, but also like a lil looks a little bit out of place. This person waves to you and says
Eric (as Regular Guy): Hi, I'm Clippy, it sounds like you're trying to solve some puzzles in the fun zone.
Julia: Oh jesus.
Eric (as Clippy): Would you like help with that?
Eric: And Dr. Morrow comes over the microphone says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright well Clippy can help you if you get into any— just tell Clippy what to do, and they they don't have any kind of like directives of their own so if you tell Clippy what to do, they can help you out with it.
Julia (as Val): They're not real right? This is not a real person?
Eric (as Clippy): No, I'm Clippy! I'm just your assistant!
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey Clippy what up?
Eric (as Clippy): Not much! Happy to do stuff.
Brandon (as Milo): Great.
Eric: Dr. Morrow says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright are you ready for your first situation?
Julia (as Val): Let's do it!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah! Let's go!
Eric: So you hear some typing, and then like slamming of a big button, and the green screen starts to change
[Upbeat 8-bit music fades in]
Eric: It's being rendered into rock, and it's starting to get really hot. You didn't know how that the green screen would be able to do temperature too, but of course Dr. Morrow is able to render it. The ground under you is cragged and cracked and there seems to be rivletts of some red and orange liquid, but it's hot and you realize this is lava, and as you look around and the sky gets gray, you are on the side of a volcano. You also see to your left there is a small ball pit
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: That is now just like in like a child's above ground pool like rubber pool, there's now like one to the side of the volcano. And uh Dr. Morrow comes over the microphone and says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright go!
Eric: And right in front of you in the rock the lava seems to be making shapes and letters into the floor and the lava spells out: find the three colored orbs and the floor is lava! Seriously it's lava.

Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to the Afterparty for episodes 9 and 10! It's the end of our first arc guys congratulations!
[Everyone cheers]
Amanda: How are we all feeling? It’s like a pit stop on our journey. We've pulled off I-90, and we're queuing in front of a KFC combination Quiznos.
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: What kind of snacks do you guys buy?
Eric: Can we be out of Buc-ee’s? Because that was the—
Amanda: Oh yeah.
Eric: The most wonderful time of my life.
Brandon: Ugh, no.
Eric: Okay Brandon's resentful because this is related to problems he has with his parents, but the rest of us, we all has a great time!
Brandon: It isn’t problems, I just inherently think that anything my mom thinks is cool is probably not cool so I don't know what that tells you.
Amanda: I mean we walked into a rest stop the size of a Walmart and it was extremely exciting, all of us and Eric Schneider and his girlfriend Kelsey in a minivan. It was extraordinary. I got caramel corn that was the best I've had in my life, Eric you have like a pulled pork or brisket sandwich right?
Eric: They just had a brisket station where you could have different types of sandwiches! There was a wall of jerky, Brandon!
Julia: The jerky was very good!
Amanda: Wall of jerky! It was incredible.
Brandon: Oh man.
Julia: The bathrooms are also extremely clean.
Brandon: I will fully admit that the bathrooms are nice yeah.
Amanda: My first thought too when walking into the Buc-ee’s was like “oh wow if I were on the lam, this would be a wonderful place to come and like change my outfit get supplies” like seed some rumors about where I was going, refuel!
Brandon: Amanda if?
[Beat of silence]
Brandon: If you were on the lam?
Eric: Yeah the amount that Amanda talks about heists, I'm worried is just gonna start happening.
Julia: Yeah Amanda’s gonna Gone Girl you one day, it’s gonna be bad.
Amanda: Listen.
Eric: NO!
Amanda: Wow Julia! Alright, there will be full-frontal nudity, I will give myself a haircut.
Eric: Then she goes and kills Neil Patrick Harris.
Julia: Yeah! Spoilers!
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: Guys I like heists for the puzzle of it all, that's why.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Brandon: Okay not for the murders sure.
Amanda: Back to the issue at hand! Congrats on the end of the first arc everybody!
Brandon: Yaaay!
Julia: We did it!
Eric: I am so happy we're finally at like the superhero part. Now that you have real names and costumes and everything, I am also— and this was the thing I was really holding for months now because we got so ahead. I think the podcast is very good, and I've always thought that but like ever since episode 9 I'm just like “fuck yeah let's get it all so good!” It's like we've really jumped a level and I'm proud of myself, but I’m also proud of you—
Brandon: Two levels!
Eric: Ugh Brandon.
Julia: Technically!
Amanda: Let's talk about that! Hey Eric, why are we leveling from 3 to 5?
Eric: We did this in the first campaign as well. This is something I took from TAZ, just because they had a very similar number of episodes per arc than we did. Just like every 9 or 10 let's just level them up. This is also something we talked about on previous afterparties. I think I'm gonna level you guys up more because of the development of superheroes as opposed to fantasy heroes. It's like you really get control of your powers and powers progress a lot more like X-Men or you know think about Spider-Man how he went from being just a big doofus 16 year old, to flying around zipping around with Tony Stark technology. So I just feel like it happens a lot faster so the arcs are gonna be a little bit shorter but we're also gonna do leveling up every two like we did last time.
Brandon: I like it.
Amanda: And the other big accomplishment of this arc. like you said Eric, is like we're firmly in the superhero part now. So why don't we talk a little bit about our costume and name inspiration since everybody on the internet is very excited to hear about it!
Eric: Well I now I wanted to say a thing and then I'll get the fuck out of the way I didn't know like that that is what happened I was just like yeah you guys think about it tell me what you want we'll do like a branding session and then Dr. Morrow will bring you a costume and then during play, I was just like oh I need to come up with their costumes but I've only heard about their names and their ideas for their heroes after like 20 minutes. Alright I guess I'll just do that so that all just kind of happened.
Julia: Yeah, I wanna say cause we did a private group chat on Slack to kind of talk about what we wanted to do and like brainstorm and stuff. I had a like almost exact vision of what I wanted Val's name and costume to be, but I know that Amanda and Brandon had a little bit less of an idea than I did. So it was fun to kind of talk things out and figure out like what names worked, and what costumes would be cool and stuff like that.
Brandon: It was a very supportive group chat, it was very nice!
Julia: It was!
Amanda: It was very feedback sandwich method, it was great, and yeah immediately after episode 9 I was I was like “hey guys let's get into a group chat, don't talk to Eric let's go” and then immediately we just brainstormed those things I had a hard time thinking about the name but once that kind of forest ranger inspiration coalesced, it became very clear and I'm super happy with how it worked out, so thanks to both of you for the help of the name! And eric to you for running with my Smokey the bear inspo.
Eric: Smokey the Bear has a really great costume for someone who only wears like three pieces of clothing. They're pretty good, they all work out.
Julia: He's just a forest ranger who's also a bear.
Brandon: It's more than most bears, three pieces of clothing.
Julia: That's true!
Eric: That’s true, Yogi the bear only wears accessories I think.
Brandon: I had even less ideas than Julia and Amanda, like I think I came to both of them like “hey help I don't know what to do” so.
Julia: You had you had great ideas for your names, it was just the costume that was kind of catching you up.
Brandon: That's true yeah, I did have— I'm lucky that physics has weird names for things.
Eric: Shout out to scientists, shout out to ghosts, shout out to space.
Brandon: Shout out to ghosts!
Eric: I think it's worthwhile just to say like what are your names, where did they come from, and what ideas were you pulling from? Just to really nail down and give people the juicy stuff, because you know if I don't know maybe theoretically someone wanted to draw—
Amanda: I don't know, maybe it'd be great, I don't know.
Eric: [Mumbling] a bunch of details or something.
Julia: Yeah so I went with Vulcani because one it was the first name that I thought of and I was like “this is it great” there's a character in the X-Men who's a villain called Vulcan and I like that name but I also obviously didn't want the same name as an X-Men character so Vulcani worked really well because one it's the plural, and therefore it's kind of like gender-neutral in Italian, and I super liked that and vulcano is volcano in Italian so there you go.
Eric: I mean I couldn't tell because you didn't say [in an exaggerated Italian accent] vulcano!
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: [In Italian] Vulcano!
Eric: [In an Italian accent] It’s-a me! Vulcano!
Julia: And then in terms of costume, I knew kind of what I wanted in terms of like there's a couple of different costume characters from like DC and Marvel that I was like, their outfits are just like branded leather jackets basically, so like the redesign of Spider Woman and Batgirl in particular were ones that I was thinking of. And then I was also just thinking about like the casual wear hero in a lot of ways so Evan Peters in the X-Men Days of Future Past I think was a another big one for me, just like silver leather jacket and a t-shirt and silver leather pants, and then in terms of like the spikes that I was thinking of for Val's jacket I really liked the redesign that they did recently for Magic from the X-Men, in terms of just like well one she has a very skimpy outfit, so not quite that but there's just like these big armor pieces that she has on her shoulders that have these huge spikes, and that was kind of the image that I was going for.
Brandon: And big sword.
Julia: Big sword, but Val doesn't have big sword, I give big sword to Moxie instead.
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: I am looking back at the chat right now and the first thing is Julia's saying “LET’S MAKE SUPERHEROES!” iin all caps and then all caps I said “JULIA HELP.”
[Julia and Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Yeah that's what happened.
Brandon: Yeah I had a couple different names that I was looking at. I was mostly looking for like obviously like spacey sciency things, I was looking at something like Macro Nova or Charmonium, which I think I put in there but it sounds too much like charmander.
Amanda: Yes, Eric would never let it go.
Brandon: Kilonova was cool because one it sounds awesome, but then two it's this like cool physics concept that just sort of was discovered I guess after the gravitational waves discovery where two black holes like circle each other because of their gravitational pull, and then end up combining and making a kilonova which is like this either this big implosion or this big explosion so I thought it was very cool. And then Julia pulled together all the stuff for me costume-wise, that was very cool um like Wiccan which ended up sort of being the inspiration for the costume because it's very cool, and I like it very much.
Julia: It's very spacey and it had the cowl that you were looking for which I thought was like a good combo.
Brandon: Yeah exactly.
Eric: Gotta love a cowl.
Brandon: Gotta love a cowl!
Eric: I want just more cow like if I had a sweatshirt that was a cowl neck that turned into a hood I would wear it every single day.
Julia: That's a legit thing I'm sure we can find one for you.
Eric: I'm sure he does but you know I'm not going— American Eagle doesn't have a 40% off so I can't get it right now.
Julia: Understandable I see.
Amanda: And for me, I didn't have any real ideas on the name I was thinking like the Conservator or like the Ranger and immediately I was like wait well the first thing I don't even know how to pronounce, and the second one is a class so that would be kind of confusing. So Julia had a very good idea about Preserver and also pointed out superhero logistics wise, that the word “the” tends to get dropped so I was thinking of myself less as like a title, and more of a name by dropping the “the”
Brandon: Uh do— do you want to point out the uh the other name that we came up with originally?
Amanda: Yes, and then both Julia and Brandon immediately said I mean Ranger Danger is very good and I was like “guys I'm not calling myself ranger danger”
[Eric laughing]
Brandon: Ranger danger danger ranger!
Julia: Danger ranger ranger danger!
Amanda: It's very good but um yeah I was inspired by forest rangers and that is definitely where my inspo came from, I actually just looked up the mission of the forest service which is in the the US Department of Agriculture and their mission is to “sustain the health diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations” so the government's law institution, but I think that this is a good kind of analog for what Aggie's mission is. And it's not to make the land or the community into any particular vision, it's to preserve choice and stop people who have a singular or monolithic vision for the space that would erase opportunities for others. So to me that was very much. I don't know the good analog for her.
Brandon: Yeah I liked that a lot it's really nice.
Amanda: And since there is a uniform associated with that kind of profession, and and genre I just sort of wanted to make a twist on it so it's a little bit exaggerated, the hat is extremely freaking cool and the colors are yeah like foresty you know green brown stuff like that.
Brandon: Fun fact did you know that forest ranger uniforms are based on Smokey the Bear, and Smokey the Bear it's not in reverse.
Julia: What? No! That— that is not true!
Amanda: Yesterday in Head Heart Gut, Mike told me that Nicholas Cage invented the cobb salad, so I would love a fact check on that.
Eric: I was also there. I don't want to be excluded from this traumatizing event that we both went through.
Amanda: It was a very fun recording.
Julia: Why wouldn't they name it the Cage salad then?
[Brandon and Eric laughing]
Eric: That's also— it was invented in 1937!
Julia: Okay, so it's just a lie. Oh yeah it's just a lie
Brandon: We all know that Nick Cage is ageless so it make sense.
Eric: No he said it got invented in the 80s.
Julia: It's not true!
Amanda: Join the Multicrew and you'll enjoy that for yourself! But wait, what—where did Smokey Bear come from then?
Brandon: Oh I'm just lying. [Eric groans]
Eric: Ohhh god.
Julia: Oh okay.
Amanda: Okay Brandon, twice in two days I've been bamboozled!
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: I just expect this from your characters that are just like “that didn't happen: and I'm like “yes they did now take 20 points of damage” but I can't— I can't damage you in any way, you're just blatantly lying to me in the afternoon.
Julia: Only emotionally.
Brandon: Yeah only emotionally!
Eric: I do say that playing Dr. Morrow hearing Preserver was very funny to me, and she just like looking at it from like a brand perspective, she's like “no, no this works we want it to be a little bit hard to mispronounce for the children, for children's sake!” That was genuine. I thought that was very fun.
Brandon: What would that sound like if children said it Eric?
Eric (as a child): Oh thank you Pwosova here's my kitty cat!
Amanda: So cute!
Julia: Adorable.
Brandon: I love it.
Julia: It's so cute.
Eric (as a child): Thank you for saving me from the robots, I appreciate it.
[Amanda and Brandon laughing]
Julia: We're gonna fight robots in the future, I guess.
Eric: That was Izzy Zephyr, age four.
Julia: Adorable! Bless you Izzy!
Amanda: Adorable.
Eric: Oh my god hearing that for the first time, I really try to put myself in the shoes of Dr. Morrow, just like hearing it from you and then regurgitating what she thinks you want as your costumes. Which was very very fun I really enjoyed that, and there were like four different dm things stacked on top of each other for me, so I had a lot of fun.
Brandon: What did January think of our names and costumes?
Eric (as January): Oh you're all really good, I like how it it took your individuality, and really showed off what you want, and really made it distinct, uh I think is really— I think it's really neat.
Brandon: God what a pure, pure bunny.
Julia: So cute.
Amanda: Love it! Let's stop briefly over in episode 9, if we take our minds back to our encounter with Ma, a couple questions about that someone in the discord named Mayor Dr. Morrow asks “is Ma's mech suit just a giant tub of ice cream, if so what's the flavor?”
Julia: Oooo!
Brandon: Yes, correct.
Julia: I feel like it's gotta be like cotton candy or something like something like that looks disgusting, and also tastes a little bit disgusting.
Brandon: Can I pitch you another idea?
Julia: Go for it.
Brandon: Werther's hard candy.
Julia: Gross, somehow worse than cotton candy.
Eric: Brandon that's just called caramel.
Julia: Oh good call.
Brandon: But it's hard it's hard and crunchy, and you have to unwrap the ice cream.
Julia: Oh yeah there's just big chunks, like there's full Werther’s caramels in there, and because they're cold they make it so much harder.
Amanda: It really extends your eating experience I guess?
Julia: But in a bad way. I was gonna say I think Ben & Jerry's maybe at some point had a oatmeal like chocolate chip, like an oatmeal cookie ice cream. That I thought was a little sweet but I like that idea, and I think a sort of like you know mom's baking inspired flavor would be Ma's favorite.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So can I come in and say what really happened, or are we just going to leave it—
Julia: Go ahead, do whatever you want.
Eric: No she's not in a tub ice cream!
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: Ugh, ruining the fantasy.
Eric: Oh my god you're right, an old woman inside of a bio freeze containment chamber turning into a mech wasn't fantastical enough, she needs to be in rocky road. I'm sorry if you can't believe it.
Brandon: If you could up the fantasy, that would be— that'd be great Eric. Too real.
Eric: Oh okay, oh I'm sorry dancing turkeys wasn't enough for you.
Amanda: [Groans] Uuugh gross.
Eric: No so this was inspired from Mr. Freeze obviously Mr. Freeze's wife but I took it in a little bit of a different direction, I always thought that Mr. Freeze— even the Arnold Schwarzenegger version was very focused because he's like “I love this woman, and I'm going to do the thing” which is the only narrative that so many people were able to latch onto for so long. So I thought that it was like very straightforward and he was competent because he was a doctor, and he was a scientist. But I like the idea that a bunch of like teenagers and 20-somethings were trying to do something for their maternal figure, and they— whatever machinations that happen with the people's river they put her in a biocontainment chamber. So it was like someone who was less competent trying to do whatever possible to put Ma in and save her from whatever disease or ailment was was hurting her, so she was like in a kind of classic like freezy chamber or science comic chamber, you know like floating in liquid and all that stuff.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Do you think that Mr. Freeze ever gets mad that they don't call him Dr. Freeze?
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: He's got a doctorate he's probably like a medical doctor why not Dr. Freeze?
Brandon: You know that's the real first like jab they can get into him, you know?
Julia: Oh right? It's fucked up!
Eric: You see he sees the papers and he's like “No! I am doctor!!” Amanda: Further, Zack would like to know if this is more of a mech like Dr. Loveless's spider body from one of the greatest movies in the 90s Wild Wild West which I don't understand or the giant killer robot from the Incredibles?
Julia: Oh it's more giant killer robot right? Like Loveless's head is just like smaller, I feel like.
Eric: Yeah it's really weird just having the legs come off which would have been very funny, but no it was really just like arms and legs bursting off of a cylindrical like torso that had Ma in a bio containment chamber in it, and then just like busting out. It was kind of like an alien like the Ripley neck mech suit, it's really just like arms and legs off of a thing, but because she's already contained in there that was something— I don't know if that got explained, but I don't know how much control Ma had over what was happening. Because there was the emergency protocol that was happening of the robot suit like busting out, and it seeming like it was running away even— and she didn't have controls so I think that maybe the mech suit was doing something that was outside of her control.
Brandon: Oh that's that puts a whole new flavor on what we did then.
Amanda: Yeah…
Julia: Yeah can I tell you guys what my plan was— or what Val's plan was to do if Amanda hadn't rolled that nat 20?
Brandon: Yes please!
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: So I was gonna take the breath weapon gum, and I was going to switch it to acid mode so that it would burn through the glass of the mech container, and pull Ma out.
Amanda: Oh god! I like that.
Eric: Oh god you would have switched it to licorice that would have been terrible.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: It's awful but useful!
Eric: That would have been terrible, Julia!
Julia: Yeah, it would've been bad.
Eric: I would be like “alright now I need to figure out what it's like for this for this frail, ill woman to be out of her container”
Julia: Who I needed to stop! Brandon was down!
Eric: That's true…
Brandon: Eric does that mean that Ma is like where is she— does that means she's in jail or is that— was she a victim? Like what— what is what's the deal then?
Eric: I mean you don't know.
Julia: Who can say?
Brandon: Who can say? Okay, okay. You don't know.
Eric: It's funny because you asked this question literally in the next episode.
Julia: We didn't get a straight answer.
Brandon: We didn't know at the time that the— or I don't think we assumed that the mech body was doing something that I assumed at least the mech body was doing was controlled by Ma.
Amanda: I mean even if she was fleeing you know to protect herself, I think it sort of gets at the same thing which is like this is unforTunate, she needs help you know, and crimes are driven by unmet needs, and like let's figure out how to how to help them.
Eric: Yeah I mean if you want to follow up on it, you totally can it's just one of those things I guess with stories and is something that we deal in adventure stories and in superhero stories and everything. It's like it's just one thing after another after another it's like once the conflict is resolved do you follow up with that? So if you want to follow up you totally can!
Brandon: No, I mean you know I trust Dr. Morrow right now, we'll see.
Julia: I do have in my notes doc like a list of things that I want to follow up on at some point. Like dangling threads that we never quite put back in.
Amanda: Love it!
Eric: That sounds great, I love that!
Amanda: And to close out episode 9 NiKhol would like to know our thoughts on the Nephew's password.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: Was the 80085 password something we improvised during gameplay, or did we collectively decide it was going to spell out boobs?I just said it.
Julia: Yeah I mean like that was something that Eric also said in the episode, was that he rolled for it.
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: Rolled to see if it was boobs!
Brandon: Yeah none of that was edited out.
Eric: I'm glad because I really wanted to be honest about it, and tell people what it's like to be a dm sometimes. Here is the note that I wrote in my document “password one tree branch looks a little out of place, a project on a trunk with a numpad pops up” so I'm just like alright all there is is there is a you need to find the tree that it is, and there will be a numpad I didn't say what it was I didn't figure out what the password would be I didn't do any of that. So when Julia was just like “I bet it’s something stupid, it's probably like boobs or something”
Brandon: Julia said penis.
Julia: No I think I think Amanda said that. I said it's probably ice cream and then Amanda said it's probably like boobs or something, and then I said it's probably penis.
Brandon: It was ice cream flavors and then I and then I was like hey we're dealing with teenagers, and then Amanda was like “oh so boobs” and then Julia was like “oh penis”
Eric: So I rolled which is something that I've learned from dimension 20 that it's like if your players have a really good idea you just gotta like ask the dice if it's a true thing or not. So I rolled and I rolled like a three and I'm just like “you know what guys? It's boobs you nailed it”
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: It's boobs!
Eric: It's boobs!
Amanda: So if we hadn't if you hadn't rolled that badly, what would we have had to do?
Eric: I think there was just some puzzle. I mean it would have been a lot of guess and check. I think you honestly did one of the ways you could have solved this again this is something that dms do all the time is like you put a puzzle quote-unquote puzzle or roadblock in front of your players, and just see what they do, and if they do something interesting it's like yeah you fucking nailed it great job that was really fun and good. So you could have figured out a way to short out the password, you could have brute forced it, you could have used your knowledge of who you were dealing with which is a totally valid way to have played this so honestly I just wanted to see what you all would do. You could have looked for a key again under a rock.
Julia: Dammit,
Amanda: [Laughing] We should always make a note to find fake rocks with keys.
Eric: That was another thing I was thinking about I was like, they probably wrote it on a post-it, and put it somewhere nearby so you totally could have looked for them.
Julia: I gotta keep remembering that you will do that in case we ever get stuck.
[Amanda and Eric laughing]
Eric: I'm just gonna keep putting it in there to see if Val learns at any time like is that this is a rule within the full world.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: So moving on to episode 10, Joey would like to know Eric about the enemy entanglement chart! Where did this idea come from, and how did you fill it up? All of us were so delighted to play this this session, it was like the most fun I'd ever had playing a game, and I just wanna know everything about the mechanics.
Brandon: I assume you can't share the like leftover ones on the chart?
Eric: Yeah so this is very similar to the way that I do the spirit surge, is that I just swap out the ones that you use with something else or I'm going to keep them because it's someone who you hate a lot and got away, and then it's going to be more powerful the next time you deal with them!
Brandon: Oh good thing that no one failed that on that um…
Julia: On the worst one too Brandon, on the worst one.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Oh my god I love this because we've recorded ahead of time and like that has repercussions and I just love it so much. Well I guess this is from exploration of other rpg systems, and things like that I guess I wanted to challenge myself to make an actual table that really works. Sometimes you make a table because you want the randomness of the world to get in there but other times, and I mean even when I made the massive item table I was like yeah I really like some of these items but some of them I don't, and then I would like massage it a little bit to make sure that you got the good items, or not the good items. But this one I'm just like alright I think I'm good enough that at this point, and this is enough set up that we can have villain place and scheme, those were the three columns on the enemy entanglement table, so I made sure to have 10 of each one that I really really liked. And then we did exactly what happened you rolled a d10 three times, and I matched it up and then I needed to come up with a scenario where that would happen. I can tell you some of the places and schemes, I think that's fine, the place I had a hospital which is like a la Joker in the second Batman movie. Armored car in a highway of course which is what ended up happening with Milo, Thornhill coffee shop, the docks, during a hockey game in Thornhill arena that was what Val did.
Julia: Hell yeah!
Eric: Office building downtown, on the skytram that's what happened to Aggie, factory in industry city, SUNY LTC, or Morrow University College, and then Astros I pick a neighborhood.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: The different schemes I had was just one grab a macguffin, hold it up for money, kidnap an important person that was Al Gore. Just straight up revenge blow it up for chaos ,again very Joker. Uh mlm or marketing scheme—
Amanda: UGH I WANTED THAT ONE.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: I had I wanted that one I wanted to have like a villan like in a different way like a villain it's not just like holding up a bank it's something else—
Brandon: [With a gruff voice] Buy my candles!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Real estate scam similar, steal everything inside, hacking for government secrets that's what happened with the Emperor, and then uh it's just a ruse to fight the hero you kind of just like want to scrap. I really like that and it really pushed me to come up with ideas like why would you do a scheme in a particular place? Which I thought was interesting and why I think Milo's scenario was so interesting, was that it was like alright this guy he's terrible, he can control terracotta warriors, but he's also trying to get government secrets from an armored car, and then what are the repercussions of that if he's defeated, or if he gets away? And that's what happened when channel 7 ½ was on the scene the gov the CIA, or whatever the hell they were came in the government came in and squashed it, and I thought that was just really funny. But now it's like that was such a world building moment it's like now we have the more of the government involved which we've only alluded to a little bit with Hank Lane with Milo's dad but now there's a real presence of people dealing with villains and stuff and like we haven't addressed like why is crime going up like why has this happened? I guess like do super villains meet superheroes like do they just need when one exists the other has to exist in the same way that like if crime happens, someone needs to stop it? So I just thought it would— I just thought it was fun.
Brandon: I love it! It's so smart!
Julia: It was a lot of fun I remember in the episode that I was like I'm very anxious rolling this because I didn't know what to expect and I went first.
Eric: Yeah those were some of my favorites, I really liked all of them, but the Emperor was someone I really wanted you all to meet, who just sucks.
Julia: The worst!
Brandon: Such a bag of trash.
Eric: And then the crime jam was really fun I just imagined like the Harlem Globetrotters— or not in the Harlem Globetrotters, the Washington Generals like the worst ones like them becoming a crime family, and then of course Professor Transform I just loved the idea of someone with like a qualcomm tablet being able to try to change the universe this is also very much like a comic trope with someone with a really really really powerful ability but they get defeated immediately.
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: I just really love it!
Julia: Yeah I felt so bad I bullied that poor poor man.
Brandon: But you felt bad about it at the moment, so you know.
Julia: Yes I did I was like “oh I push him down, oh no.”
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Oh man I what I loved about this, I did put different like game constraints on this it's just like it was just supposed to be really quick, so it was a challenge roll. But since Professor Transform had his tablet, he had +5 but then you immediately broke it, and then he had +1 so you beat the tough roll, and then he and then he's just like someone who went to Pratt, you know?
Julia: Just a dude.
Eric: Someone who went to um what's the one in Rhode Island he went to RISD, and that's it.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Incredible man, I could play that table all day long and like to your credit it didn't occur to me that you had to come up with the logic of the scenario, because you just said the items, and then like we were in the scene, and it didn't even occur to me that you had to figure that out. So it felt very seamless from my point of view, and super fun, and I want to play it all the time.
Eric: Well we're going to! We're going to do it every time in between arcs, I mean things happen that don't need massive stories, so it's like if you end up getting a new rival who's to say the Emperor if they escape again like won't be a bigger deal in the story?
Julia: Who's to say speaking of rivals Joey would also like to know why didn't Emily Slaughter give herself a superhero identity? That is a cool name but isn't she worried about the consequences of being a super-powered figure?
Julia: I have a theory and it's that Emily Slaughter, not the not the real good person who makes good dice, but character is a narcissist.
[Eric and Amanda laughing]
Brandon: I don't think that's much of a theory, just more like provable fact.
Julia: Yeah, that's true.
Eric: Yes, I think that she is the type of person who is willing to forgo the regular things of superhero identities and code names, I know she has a really sick name, but is very much like Nick Fury in that way I know he is like a ensconce within SHIELD, and not actually a superhero but it is similar Emma Frost was something that I was pulling from as well. She's just like out there being Emma Frost.
Julia: Tits out, being herself. Eric: [Laughing] I cannot speak to Emily Slaughter in that capacity as well. But in regards to this conference that Tegan reported on Emily really put this stuff together, and she wanted to be the face they can contact her “look me up I'll mess you up with my big sword” you know? It's kind of like a challenge, if you're doing exactly the opposite of conventional wisdom. So that was intentional yes.
Brandon: It is interesting that like it always seems to be the bad guys that can pull off not really having a disguise in the superhero realm.
Julia: Lex Luthor yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: I guess they just don't care, or they are their persona you know?
Amanda: It's a metaphor for wealth, when you have a certain amount you just think you’re untouchable!
Julia: Well we know that Emily has a lot of money for some reason.
Brandon: That's true.
Amanda: Yes we do.
Julia: We don't know why.
Amanda: Well speaking of Tegan, Kim Smith Happy would like to know more about everyone's reaction to the article, “it felt like everyone was just like oh okay, and then carried on with thanksgiving lol”
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: I will say there is some discussion of the article that I pushed to the next episode, so there will be more discussion of the article, um so I don't want to spoil too much but we can give general reactions.
Julia: Cool.
Amanda: Uh yeah I think Aggie was horrified, and frozen, and wanted not to think about it.
Julia: I mean I think it really did impact Aggie more than the rest of us because Aggie was the only person named, and like even like from an aside, Milo and Val weren't mentioned at all. Like the the bank heist wasn't mentioned, none of our do-goodings during the like with Professor Transform, and whatnot uh were mentioned either. So I don't think it really impacted them as muchm but I definitely think it impacted Aggie.
Brandon: Yeah I mean I think it would only impacted us and insofar as like we are attached to Aggie at this point. So like Aggie's you know unmasking could be ours as well.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: But it's also important to note that no one knows that who Milo is, and he's never been seen on camera, or film doing anything suspicious—
Julia: Uhh huh, never. Never ever so. But also didn't mention the Preserver at all either, it just kind of mentions Aggie and the O'Hare family as people.
Amanda: Yeah and I I think Aggie's reaction more specifically was less about like immediate fallout, because I don't even think she's online enough to realize that you know it might be a problem, but more like drawing attention to the fact that her family is different, and kind of tracing all of those connections, that was the scary thing, and also the fact that it may have repercussions for her team. And I think Aggie shares this with me, of taking responsibility for everybody's suffering, and one not wanting to bring any more upon anybody that I care about.
Julia: Bud, no.
Amanda: But we will definitely talk more about the article, and it's fallout don't worry.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Kim would also like to know: Julia how uncomfortable were the new leather trousers that Val wears? How long did it take to break them in? Was their chafing?
Julia: I think it took the usual amount to break them in, it didn't chafe as bad as you would think because Val is a barbarian so they took half damage.
Brandon: [Laughing] So their skin is much stronger.
Amanda: I'm jealous.
Brandon: Exactly two times as strong.
Eric: You took half piercing damage.
Julia: Yeah!
Amanda: Nice.
Julia: Feels right!
Amanda: Vennik would like to know what kind of gadgets would each of us have on a utility belt!
Julia: Hmm…
Brandon: Shark spray!!
Julia: Like us personally or the characters?
Amanda: The characters, I think and I mean we will talk about more items in the episodes to come, I think some kind of like flashlight that illuminates spells, or illuminates uh spectral figures that would be kind of cool from a forest ranger perspective so, Eric uhh, if you want to uh make some notes that would be great!
Julia: Val just has a shaker of powdered parmesan.
[Brandon and Eric laughing]
Amanda: Incredible.
Eric: That's like the equivalent of being like “yeah I always have pepper in my pocket just in case someone runs up on me I just throw it in their face”
Amanda: Aggies by the way is a multi-tool which she always has on her, like even in the pocket of her robe at home.
Eric: You asked me like in episode 1 or something when we were we were doing this and you were like “can I have a leatherman?”
Amanda: Yeah as an item for Aggie to have a leatherman.
Eric: I'm like yeah, just like make sure like you can't use the corkscrew to like do something wild with it. It's just a corkscrew.
Amanda: Yeah I like made a list of the things, and it is not a powered leatherman it's just like the one that I have here, with like an okay wood file.
Eric: I can't remember if this was Aggie or during a DDR, because it really is one of the same of the thing that you would want or what Aggie would want at this point.
Amanda: I did carry one in a DDR episode but, I also asked that about Aggie, and like making the adventurer pack tools or like the carpenter tools, or whatever into something that she would be carrying day to day.
Brandon: Yeah that's cool. Yeah I think Milo wouldn't want probably like some sort of like phaser or like tricorder situation, um whether it be like so he could like shoot to stun, or like use the tricorder to assess some sort of you know information about the situation.
Amanda: It'd be cool if you could sense the person's lowest modifier score.
Brandon: Oh yeah!
Julia: That would be neat.
Brandon: That's a good idea!
Eric: That's true you all don't need a utility belt because unlike Batman you have actual powers other than being incredibly rich.
Amanda: Ellie Page would like to know to wrap up episode 10, do Sushi and Tuna get along? Are they friends now? I have to know if they talked about sob.
Brandon: I think so, what do you think Amanda?
Amanda: I think Sushi is incredibly blase, and finds Tuna frenetic, and amusing. Which I think is the opposite to how Tuna usually relates to the world, where Tuna's usually lulling on their back being like “I don't care surprise me” but I think the dynamic is reversed, and Tuna finds that disconcerting.
Brandon: I love that! I think um they could have like a cat based like odd couple sitcom you know?
Amanda: Oh sure!
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: Yeah I see that! I love it! I don't have a January here to make me a pina colada, so instead guys I'm going to break into the kitchen to refill our pitcher.
Julia: Thank you!
Amanda: Be right back!
[Transition note]
Amanda: Hey, it’s Amanda. Sometimes when putting away the dishes I feel like an acrobat because I know so perfectly the weight of those plates, and cups, and pots in my hands, and my motions are perfectly calibrated, I hang it without a gesture wastes, I put the plates down without clanking them. And it feels for a moment like I am perfectly in tune with my environment. Welcome to the midroll, I saved your favorite mug for you!

We say it every week on the Multitude shows, but we are truly grateful for each and every person who supports us on Patreon. All four of us are full-time podcasters, and that’s due in large part to your support on Patreon. Especially as an independent collective trying to make it in a volatile industry during a volatile time, being able to count on your support on Patreon is absolutely crucial. And as a thank-you we produce a ton of bonus content like bloopers, NPC backstories, and maintain with the help of our mods, a thriving Discord, not to mention a full campaign’s worth of bonus material from Campaign 1. Today is a great day to join us for as little as $5 a month at patreon.com/jointhepartypod.
It’s my favorite time of year, because it is Multitude Survey Season! Once a year we ask you, our audience, a bunch of questions we’ve been wondering about. What kind of ads you like best? What time of day should episodes come out? What kind of merch should we make? (We’re working on the dice, don’t worry!) How are you enjoying our shows? What do you want to see us do next? Your responses truly guide our decision-making, so now is your chance to change the future and tell us what you’re thinking. The survey takes about 10 minutes and can be done on mobile or desktop. Just go to multitude.productions/survey to get started. That’s multitude.productions/survey
We are sponsored this week by WorldAnvil.

We are sponsored this week by Hero Forge. Talking about showing off your character, Hero Forge is the place to make fully customizable tabletop miniatures, you can choose between every variation you can think of: the base for your mini, their hair color, the kind of hair they have, the style of hair, piercings, things that they’re holding in their hands, you can now change their posture, the movement their hands as well! It’s truly, truly amazing, and they even add new things every single week.

Finally, we are sponsored this week by BetterHelp, a secure online counseling service. They connect you with licensed counselors through their secure app, letting you message with your therapist and schedule live phone or video sessions. I had one today at 10:00 A.M. which I normally would not be able to do with an in-person therapist because A) that’s not possible right now, and B) getting anywhere and building time to my day to leave, go to therapy, and come back. It takes hours, and that’s not always practical to fit into your day. But with BetterHelp I can have therapy in my living room, or in a private room in my office and that is so flexible. They even let you switch counselors if need be. They don’t charge you. It's easy, it’s free. BetterHelp is also more affordable than traditional counseling, with financial aid also available. I’ve had a great experience, and if you want to try BetterHelp for yourself, you can get 10% off your first month of counseling by signing up at betterhelp.com/jointheparty. That’s better h-e-l-p . com / jointheparty for 10% off your first month. Better h-e-l-p . com / jointheparty.
And now, back to the show!
[Transition note]
Amanda: Alright returning we have a new uh picture of of pina coladas here for us all to share in the virtual space, World Anvil who knew we could share a drinks?
Julia: There you go!
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Oh no I finished mine it's all ice!
Julia: Awww.
Eirc: Awww no.
Brandon: I'm tipsy on a Thursday morning.
[Eric and Julia laugh]
Amanda: Well Chrissy Mack would love to know what kind of cocktail decorations and garnishes does January put on those frozen pina coladas?
[Brandon repeatedly mhm’s]
Eric: Julia's gonna give a real answer, but what I'm gonna say is just like really really large slices of pineapple.
Brandon: Good choice.
Julia: I like that actually, I think that's a better answer than mine which is in Japan as like little snack things. They will sometimes slice apples to look like rabbits, and that's what I pictured it being on the glass.
Brandon: Oohhhh, that’s so cute!
Eric: Perfect pineapple rabbits! Perfect!
Julia: Pineapple rabbits I love it!
Eric: We've already established that January is incredibly dexterous when it comes to uh crafts because of his calligraphy, so truly sky's the limit.
Brandon: Maybe he has like um like cherry nose or cherry hat?
Julia: Adorable very cute! Cherry nose is I think the way to go yeah.
Amanda: Alara would like to know for the players do we ever make decisions that go against what we think our character would actually do, because it makes the story more interesting? That's really— that's a really good question.
Julia: I genuinely try to always do the thing that I feel like Val would do in the moment, like I think that in particular shined when I rolled that very low perception check and then chased after the teens through the woods.
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: But I always try to do the thing that I think Val would do rather than being like “how do I solve this puzzle best?”
Brandon: Yeah I agree, I think it's actually sort of the opposite like I always try to do what Milo would do, or what any character I'm playing would do, and it's more on the character design side, where I try to design a character that is either something in line with something I would do or like purposely not what I would do. So I can have fun with that and that usually ends up being the thing that does make the story more interesting anyway.
Amanda: Yeah me too I tried to design the character I know I've said before, uh like different to Inara, just for sort of interest and like me growing as a player. But I also thought it would be useful to have a character in terms of like party composition and storyline who is really committed to the way things are because many plots in superhero media and also in D&D, is about people trying to bring about change and I thought that would be kind of a good tension um to negotiate.
Brandon: Yeah I think like real people in real life like try to solve problems honestly and quickly and efficiently and with the least amount of harm, whereas like characters in D&D in order to make interesting characters need to have some sort of personality flaw right? Or like something that drives them or whatever it is so they make mistakes more than like a normal human might.
Amanda: Anthony over on the patreon would like to know Eric you sometimes ask your players for info and direction in your stories, how do you give them what they want but also keep the surprises coming?
Eric: Ah that's a really good question, I think I keep the surprises, and I let them do everything else. Like there are as I've explained I think on specific episodes like when I asked about rooms in Dr. Morrow's secret cabin in the woods, it's like I would love it if you could help me populate the world so I will let you there's also when you make perception checks or inside checks I have a lot of information that I want to tell you, but if you were doing this in real life, I want you to ask me a question that I will then answer truthfully. Because you rolled well on a perception or an insider investigation. So it's not just like what hey what's in the room? It's like I'm looking for secrets, I'm looking for clues, I'm looking for footsteps, or it's like how is this person dealing with this situation. Is a question better than lying? So I want to hear that so that I can populate the thing that you want or looking for that's about driving the plot forward. The other stuff is that everything about a world so much happens that you as a person don't know about, and when that's revealed to you is a surprise, and realizing so much about dungeons and dragons is cause and effect. It's like I do this thing, and then these are the consequences so I do this thing and these are the consequences, all that stuff is really happening outside of the world I don't think dungeon dragons does a very good job as a game system about explaining that, but in Blades in the Dark which is about heists which you all check out it's an incredibly good RPG. They have like a circle system where when you want to do a project, or where someone off screen is doing a project, you divide a circle into a certain number of of pieces, and then if over time or because of actions that triggers those pieces to get filled in, and then when that whole circle is filled in then the thing happens. But you can be doing something that you don't know is related to the circles off-screen, it's like oh I do all these things but you're actually secretly furthering this cabal that wanted you to steal this thing to fight this person to cause a lot of chaos. So that's something I'm really trying to keep in mind although I don't have these these Blades in the Dark circles, it is stuff they think about in between episodes like alright this happened so I wonder if there are people off screen that are thinking about this stuff or people on screen who are doing stuff y'all don't see, because we spend so much time one-on-one with the characters, which is why I like doing one-on-one scenes and individual stuff where y'all and go explore the thing that you want to go explore. Like what is happening off screen so that I can surprise them later.
Amanda: My favorite part about that mechanic is that the circles advance with time, and if you don't stop somebody, or like try to arrest their project the project inches toward being done. So I had that in mind just knowing about Blades in the Dark, as we were talking about the Nephews at first because I was like even if they're not heisting another bank this episode they are working on something, and that is what I think drove me and drove Aggie to you know. Like dampness in your ceiling—
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Amanda: It's advancing if you don't see it you gotta you— gotta get to it, you gotta address it you gotta find it a better place to live uh before it it caves in your bathroom.
Eric: Actually that's an incredible point, now that we've wrapped up what the Nephews are doing right now. I feel like I can kind of reveal some stuff that you did that changed the course of what the Nephews were doing you foiled the Nephews in various places. So remember that initially the bank thing happened they tried to steal that sign, which was important to them but also they were trying to steal other stuff to fund the cash, which you now realize might have had something to do with keeping Ma in bio freeze-stasis right? The other thing when you and Emily Slaughter were deciding what you were going to do if you were going to watch the jail, or stake out in historic Laketown, they were trying to break the other Nephews out of jail so then that would have been two different diverging paths you would have tried to catch them while they were doing it, and then there would have been a big chase scene. Or you caught them like you did the secret spy thing which is hit them while they were away, and hit their home base and because you scrambled out of that stuff and let the mountain lobster out of the garage, that also changed some stuff.
Amanda: My bad, my bad.
Julia: I got to— sorry that's one more thing I have to add to my list of things we haven't followed up on yet.
Eric: So you you all did all these things that now. You defeated a lot of them the Knight of Mirrors brought in the guy who was supposedly at the top below Ma. The one who was trying to run Va lover with an ice cream truck.
Julia: Asshole.
Eric: So they were really depleted so when you went in and broke into the secret secret home base, there were only like three guys down there because the rest of them were in jail! So a lot of things that you did were stymying the Nephews but if you had done different things or not done them as well, their clock would have been a lot farther there, would have maybe there would have been a lot more people in the secret base, maybe they would have had a weapon, or they would have been a lot more put together, they would have had a lot more ice cream trucks like that was another thing I was trying to push. That like there were ice cream trucks roaming around that could have hurt you in different ways because they knew that you were trying to fuck with their shit. So like there was a lot of things that you could have done but because you kept rolling so well, and because I kept rolling like dog shit was that you really had one over on the Nephews and this is how it kind of shook out, and you were able to spend a lot of time with Dr. Morrow that their plot and scheme and whatever they're doing with the people's river, and whatever happened with Ma only went as far as what happened.
Brandon: Nice!
Julia: Well it's good to know we made our lives easier by doing well!
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: Now I wouldn't have told you that but now that the threads are put together it's like you all did a very good job!
Brandon: We are good superheroes is what I’m hearing!
Eric: I mean Val knocked over an ice cream truck like they—
Julia: They! Did!
Eric: They were— they also I don't think that they were very aware of the powered element because the Nephews are kind of just like they were a lot more on them if you're on a scale of super villain to like crime boss they're a lot more on the crime side, they just had some like super some super science tech.
Julia: That we don't know where it came from.
Amanda: And it's funny like all of these episodes for the most part were recorded before quarantine, I think the last handful were the first ones that we had recorded remotely, and even in that time you know our attitudes toward the police, and toward crime are so different, and I feel like now redoing the beginning of that arc you know it would— like my instincts would be different. And it would be more asking like what is— what is wrong that you are doing this unless you know let's you know figure out a way to like change your behavior.
Eric: Yeah definitely about my view of the use of police and media, I just think it's an interesting— they were a really easy stand-in for government, because there were people out there which is absolutely the way that the police are and for very bad reasons that are hurting people are not actually the people's actual interests. But the tension between, I was really caught up in like police procedurals and superhero media that is just like yeah Jim Gordon's theremand he's like the regular human side to the superhero side. And it's like that's just not fucking what it is and I saw Officer Roper just kind of has a bumbling incompetent cop, which comes up so much like in Brooklyn 99 that's what Jake Peralta is but now it would have been something totally different and I don't think Aggie wouldn't have gone to Officer Roper for help and Officer Roper if you did would probably would have been like “fuck it, deal with it yourself.” So that wouldn't have even happened.
Amanda: We got an email full of very good questions from Megan, so let's have a little Megan corner.
Eric: We can spread them out like they're sprinkles, use them like sprinkles! You can’t just dump all of the sprinkles all at once.
Julia: You can though and then it's delicious.
Amanda: Let's uh let's sprinkle these jim-jams over the ice cream sundae. Brandon, Eric and Julia can the three of you name Aggie siblings as fast as possible?
[Eric laughing]
Julia: No!
Brandon: I can't wait—
Julia: Hold on I'm going to try.
Brandon: Okay.
Julia: Do you want to go first Brandon?
Amanda: You can do it at the same time.
Eric: Can we do this collaboratively?
Julia: Okay so it's Aggie first,
Eric: And then Danny,
Julia: Danny.
Brandon: Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Callie,
Julia: Kelly, no Kelly.
Brandon: Kelly, Quinn
Julia: Regan, Ryan, Quinn.
Eric: Regan, Ry— no Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn is how it is.
Julia: Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn. Okay.
Amanda: There you go, want to put them all together?
Eric: Aggie, Danny,
Julia: Cassie,
Eric: Kelly, Cassie?
Julia: No Cassie, Reagan, Cassie,
Eric: Reagan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn.
Julia: Reagan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn.
Eric: Oh okay yes.
Amanda: Ryan and Regan are twins so I flip them sometimes but yes you got them all. Good job!
Julia: Okay great! Good job!
Eric: It was a group— it was a group project!
[Brandon laughs]Amanda: Like families! This one isn't a Megan question, but I think it is in spirit um Ella would like to know if each of the players would transplant their campaign one pc into Lake Town City, uh what kind of role in the story could they play? And Eric the for the NPC of your choosing.
Brandon: Uh I think Tracey would freak the hell out of everyone out, so.
Julia: Really in our very technologically advanced city?
Brandon: I think it would be bad.
Amanda: I think Tracey would be January's pal and they would pal around.
Brandon: Definitely.
Eric: Tracey would be something that Dr. Morrow invented, 100%.
Brandon: I think so yeah.
Eric: An anxious robot? Yeah! 100% that fits in our world very well!
Amanda: I think Inara would be a student at GAGA, and get very interested in the docks and what is going on over there, shout out to the mushroom syndicate mentioned in the world building episodes, um and uh and and get her nose into trouble down there.
Julia: I feel like Kohl would be a low level Morrowcorp employee.
Amanda: Ooo yeah!
Julia: Who also runs a wrestling promotion like a small indie one on the side.
Eric: I love that. We have established that there is roller derby in Lake Town City so I feel like Kohl would scrap in there.
Julia: Oh yeah for sure.
Eric: Um here's the thing I think I'm bringing some really similar Stoneface energy like split in between January and Sour Anthony.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: It's like two NPCs need to do the power of one powerful NPC, so those two it's like if you smoosh January and Sour Anthony together you get Stoneface.
Julia: I think that's uh that's really hurting Stoneface in a lot of ways associating him with Sour Anthony.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Stoneface is like Sour Anthony's uncle and he's like “he'll grew into himself”
Eric: This is like— it's a real dark spider like a real Spider-Man Venom situation like January is all the good parts of Stoneface and Sour Anthony is all the bad parts of Stoneface.
Julia: Okay that's fair.
Amanda: To close out our Megan corner of this episode, is the Crime Jam family related to Jim from Jim Jams? I also have the best idea for a treat in like Lake Town City ready? Jim Jam Tim Tams. That's a Megan original that's tm Megan.
Julia: Jim jam Timbly tomblies.
Brandon: Yes! That’s I was gonna say too!
Amanda: Yeah, yeah.
Brandon: Jimmbily Jomblies!
Julia: Jimbily Jombilies!
Amanda: It was— it was Jim's effort at rebranding but they didn't really take off.
Julia: They tasted bad, no one wants a licorice flavored doughnut hole.
Eric: Oh god.
Brandon: That's true!
Eric: Yeah but it does acid damage so it's fine!
Julia (as Val): Yeah but to your stomach!
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Oh no!
Eric: Uuugh!
Amanda: Alright is everybody ready for a spoily corner?
Julia: [Singing] Spoily corner! Who can say?
Brandon: [Laughing] That's so good!
Eric: Do do do!
Amanda: Alright from Joey what or who is the people's river, and then four eyes emojis.
Julia: Who can say? I wish I knew!
Brandon: Who. Can. Say.
Amanda: I would love to know but I can't because—
Brandon: It's just a river.
Eric: What— okay here's— this is I would love to ask you this question, so that I know what you know about the people's river, what do you know about the people's river right now?
Julia: They have technologically advanced like weaponry, and stuff that it they have been supplying to the Nephews.
Brandon: Yeah I'm assuming based on world building episode that they are the sort of like environmentalists eco-terrorism group but I don't—
Julia: Like the mushroom syndicate people?
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Maybe.
Amanda: That's all we got.
Eric: Cool. No good that's— that's what I was hoping, this is wonderful!
Amanda: I feel like I failed a quiz somehow.
Julia: Hate that, I don't like it one bit.
Eric: Who can say really?
Julia: Who can say.
Eric: Did you all see the graphic I made for myself?
Everyone: Yes.
Eric: I'm like “I make graphics for all my friends I want to make one for myself!”
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Blake Brinkley asks how much of a heel turn can we expect from Slaughter? She has not sat right with me since she fan splained Milo's collector's item to him.
Brandon: [Laughing] Fan-splained.
Julia: I am suspicious of Emily Slaughter 100% so suspicious!
Brandon: I've never heard fansplain before, and that's very good!
Amanda: It's very demonstrative.
Eric: Now Julia are you mad that she was written up in an article, and you weren't?
Julia: No, Val doesn’t give a fuck!
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda: Marmooo19 Caitlyn asks what were the other options on the spirit search table for when Brandon rolled and Milo ended up on fire, what was the option that was most hilarious for Eric to come up with?
Julia: [Whispering] Who can say?
Brandon: Who can say.
Julia: Is it a who can say?
Eric: That is who can say! The spirit surge, like I said like the spirit surge, I refresh so I can't tell you because it might come up.
Brandon: Oh a note on that by the way we did not miss a couple spirit surges in the like vignettes, they just like—they're vignettes.
Julia: They didn't count.
Brandon: We don't do that, uh if I ever miss one it's probably just because I edited out on accident or some reason, but we are very diligent I promise.
Eric: That's fine yes! I was thinking about that I'm like I wouldn't have done a spirit surge in a vignette because sometimes they don't match up.
Amanda: And like time passes and it could have you know happened—
Julia: You could have spirit surged off-screen.
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: You're not gonna spirit surge every time, that might be interest— oh that's actually very interesting about okay. I'll think about it never mind.
[Amanda and Julia laugh]
Amanda: And finally from SmokingMusket on Twitter: convince me that the voice that talked Milo isn't the Council of Bright breaking through the multiverse. Hint you can't.
[Brandon and Julia laugh]
Amanda: Who could say!
Brandon: Um, I think I could say! It's not that.
Julia: Alright that's fair!
Eric: Who can say, really?
Amanda: Who can say?!
Eric: Who can say! It is funny that you've given me two opportunities with your PCs to have them have direct links to a great and powerful unknown. I find that very funny.
Brandon: I don't think— I don't like this is not like a critique this is just a statement that I didn't think about, like I was not thinking about that at all I was not thinking of like a deity for Milo or anything. So it's interesting that you went that way.
Eric: Not even a deity, it's more like it's more just like we've established ghosts exist so—
Julia: Hmmm.
Eric: We need to reckon with that you know?
Julia: Listen I'm not saying warlock Milo shouldn't be a thing, but I'm also not saying it should be a thing.
Brandon: Milo's just a druid so—
Julia: Okay… Okay.
Eric: Don't worry Julia's already sent me—
Julia: Ideas for multi-class!
Eric: And I've already given her a bananas one and she's like “oh yeah I really love it how in superhero stories like when something gets taken away from the hero their like powers change and then become really like more powerful” and I'm like huh!
[Amanda and Brandon laughing]
Eric: It’s not coming away from them now huh…
Julia: That's not what I said!
[Eric laughing]
Julia: I said I agreed that if there was going to be a change of some sort, that is the only reason that Val would probably multi-class is because it would be in reaction to a major emotional thing.
Amanda: I'm hearing that that is an option for the dm now.
[Eric cackling]
Julia: It was an option for the dm to begin with!
Amanda: Yeah I just I'll never get over Eric asking me at like midnight one night “hey uh which sibling is Aggie closest to?” and I was like NOO.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Julia: What was the answer Amanda?
Amanda: You'll see! Who can say okay?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Now that you know that you level up twice after every arc if you do want to multi-class, I would say think about it and it needs to make narrative sense, however feel free to pull from the shit that happens in the arc and then use that as justification. Like it because this is an experience it's a milestone version of leveling up, but now you know the milestone always happens, so it's not just like oh you leveled up congratulations! So feel free if you do want a multi-class or you do want to change something like you want to change your subclass or something or you want to change your class altogether, use the down time to do that 100%!
Amanda: Fascinating! Well everybody thanks for joining me here on a very rainy Thursday morning for this Afterparty, and everyone listening thank you for your great questions for your engagement, for your fan art of our superhero personas, and costumes I just putting it into the universe! Yeah you know!
Brandon: Thank you for hosting us with all the pina coladas, Amanda, was very delightful!
Amanda: No problem I have to find out what to do with this frozen drink maker now!
Julia: Ooo make more frozen drinks!
Eric: Now Amanda uh would you say that we are the single most popular podcast in the entire world right now?
Amanda: Uh… No.
Eric: Well I think that would be a really good opportunity for people to tell people to listen to Join the Party.
Amanda: That’s so true!!
Eric: Share with your friends!
Amanda: Yeah! The end of the first arc is a wonderful time to get someone else into the show!
Eric: I know that we're like the fifth most popular podcast in the entire world!
Brandon: There's still ways to go up!
Eric: We’ll get up there, but seriously the best way for the Join the Party family and fandom to grow, is by you sharing the podcast with people you know. So we think we're really neat, and we know you think we're really neat, but please tell a friend, tell your game person you play games with, tell your cousin who just recently got into dungeon and dragons now that they're in college this would be a great time to do it because we have 10 hot fire episodes and we promise 9 and 10 are very good!
Julia: Pew pew pew!
Brandon: Tell your sentient rabbits.
Amanda: And you don't even know what's happening in the next arc, like this is—
Julia: I’m so excited!!!
Amanda: This is bordering on rude, but it's very good, I'm very excited!
Julia: It’s very good!
Amanda: Alright everybody! Thanks again for listening!
Brandon: Bye!
Julia: Later!
Eric: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Unless you bring me a pina colada, and then it's fine actually pina coladas are made with the devil's fruit! Coconut is nasty, no one should ever drink coconut or eat coconut ever!
Brandon: Cutting you off.
Amanda: We like a daiquiri, we like a marg—
Eric: If god wanted us to eat coconut why—
[Theme music]
Julia: Uh sorry guys jake has called me like three times in a row, I'm just gonna give him a call back sorry.
[Beat of silence]
Julia: Hold on I have to go pull dough out of the fridge
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda: For a calzone?
Julia: Yes for a calzone!
[Everyone cheering]
Eric: I want a calzone so bad!"

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party…
Eric: Did you know there was a secret hideout below historic laketown? No one did, not even Aggie. The party broke into the Nephews’ base of operations, cracking their password of BOOBS, making a big ruckus, and punching some doofuses. They pushed their way into the back room, which was as cold as a walk in freezer. Inside were pints and pints of ice cream, and Ma herself, held in a biofreeze containment chamber. Ma cryptically explained her situation and her and her children’s devotion to something called the People’s River, before busting through the ceiling as her biofreeze containment chamber turned into a mech. Man, this game is fun. Let’s get the party started.
[Theme music]
Eric: At that moment then you hear the mechanical running of the the Ma mech did you hear [buzzing noises] and The Knight of Mirrors uh is holding a hand out to you three.
[Suspenseful ominous music]
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): What's the plan? Are we going after it?
Julia (as Val): I mean we gotta, alright.
Julia: And Val just grabs Milo by the shirt
[Brandon yelps]
Julia: Oh you don't even have a shirt on! By the back of the jumpsuit, just throws him up to the Knight of Mirrors.
Amanda: Yeah I’ll grab on to his ankle and Val onto mine.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sorry brian see you later!
Julia (as Val): Take care of Yabby!
Eric (as Brian): Uh what?! What is happening?!
Eric: Yeah Yabby tries to make a break for it and Officer Roper moves after them. The Knight of Mirrors pulls over to I guess someone just has like a dirt bike that they left out like
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Hey who's riding with me? The other two can grab this.
Amanda (as Aggie): That's my truck across the street, anyone who wants you can come with me.
Eric: Alright so how do you want to split up?
Julia: I think I'm gonna go with the Knight of Mirrors.
Amanda (as Aggie): Milo with me.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah yeah!
Brandon: And Milo's gonna follow Aggie and hop in the bed of the truck.
Amanda (as Aggie): I have a seat belt up here.
Brandon (as Milo): [Frantically] I'm already down!
Amanda (as Aggie): Alright.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Alright let's go!
[Eric makes a vroom sound]
Eric: Alright so Ma’s just trucking down the highway out of town. Because historic lake town is the northernmost part of Lake Town City this is like a road that goes up north towards Canada.
Brandon: Oh yeah Old Canada Road.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Yeah! The highway that just leads out north. So she's just like trucking down this road, and now with the Knight of Mirrors with Val on their tron bike, and Aggie driving and Milo the bed, you just pull behind them. They're fast and they're gaining, so the way this is gonna work is you all get like a team action together, so you all do something together, and then Ma’s gonna do something, and then you're gonna roll to see the difference of how the chase goes.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So this is your opportunity to do something.
Julia: I think Val is just gonna like
Julia (as Val): If you get me close enough, I can handle this.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I can try, we can— we'll spend all of our time trying to go as fast as we can.
Julia (as Val): Yes please.
Brandon: I can also do spike growth which will make the terrain in front of Ma difficult terrain.
Julia: That'll be useful, you remember when you used that on us?
Brandon: No what are you talking about?
Julia: You're the worst
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: Alright so during the chase I'm gonna give the Knight of Mirrors advantage on trying to catch up, because you spend your whole time going fast, and Milo do that spike growth.
Brandon: So Milo’s going to cast spike growth and that gives a 20 foot radius circle around the point, any creature that moves into that area takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet of travels, and you have to make a wisdom check against my spell safety to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it. So what happens is Milo feels the energy sort of collected the center of his body, and then a disc of shadow energy radiates from his chest, and lands on the road and you sort of see it sort of melts like tar onto the pavement. But then it just becomes normal looking asphalt.
Eric: Awesome alright I'm gonna make a wisdom saving throw.
[Suspenseful music]
Eric: Yep I definitely do not pass!
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Alright so Ma just does not see this, and tries to run through it and takes a bunch of damage.
Brandon: It's 2d4 piercing for every five feet.
Eric: So the Ma runs forward 10 feet and realize that it's all stuck, and then whatever is controlling the mech is like
Eric (as Mech): [Robotic voice] Danger danger! Tough terrain ahead! Turn around!
Eric: And the mech turns around, and then runs back so that's 20 feet, and then runs right at Aggie and Milo and the truck. So it's going to do a bludgeoning ram with one of its arms against Aggie's truck.
Amanda: Yeah but my truck's a good truck.
Eric: I rolled. It is a good truck but, I rolled it on natural 20.
Julia: Oh boy.
Eric: So it hits and I'm doing ram, so it gets an extra 1d10 for each 10 feet it runs.
Amanda: Poor truck.
Eric: So I'm not going to do damage to the truck, I'm gonna just do it to you two to make it easier, so both of you take 20 points of damage.
Amanda: So now I have 2 HP!
Eric: Alright.
Julia: Oh boy.
Brandon: And uh… Milo fainted, so I'm down.
Julia: Seriously?
Brandon: Yeah…
Julia: Dang. Okay oh boy.
Eric: Alright so Ma did also travel back, so in the catching up to her portion it's gonna be pretty even. So Aggie you're still driving and The Knight of Mirrors is still driving, Milo is down so all of us are gonna roll dexterity roles to see how far or close Ma is going to run away.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: I got five but I'm spending my final luck point.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Nat 20.
Eric: [Laughing] What!
[Dice rolling]
Julia: 17.
Eric: Alright so—
Amanda: Can I tell you what I want to happen?
Eric: Yeah you are almost catching up to Ma, you are now neck and neck.
Amanda: Well I would like to when I saw the mech start to double back, I would have slammed on the brakes so I didn't completely run into it, and I would like for the truck to kind of like skid around a little bit and for the mech to get kind of clotheslined, and land on its back in the bed of my truck.
Eric: I didn't roll high enough for me to be able to dispute this at all, so yeah that's 100% what happens.
Julia: Eat those dice, Eric!
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: I'm gonna—so they land right next to Milo, who is now passed out which I did not notice,
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: I am going to haul Milo out to put him in the cab, and use the bungee cords that I obviously have in the back of my truck at all times to bungee the mech down using the like holds in the bed of my truck.
Eric: Yeah— um yeah I'm gonna try to resist the bungee cords, and try to get away. Yeah make a an attack roll to grapple it with the bungee cords.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: For anyone that's curious my boxers did protect that region very well.
[Eric and Amanda laughing]
Amanda: They landed next to you, with a nat 20. They were next to you, not on you.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: I only got a 7.
Eric: Alright well I rolled a 3, so yeah I this thing is just like super top heavy because of—
Amanda: Because of the water and the body?
Eric: Yeah like it's also melting, because it doesn't have great coolant, as it's also running, and it's hot so it's super top heavy, so as soon as you push it over you're able to restrain the mech arms, yeah. You did it you you caught the Ma mech.
Julia: Sorry that was way easier than you were probably planning on it being.
Brandon: Aggie is really efficient.
Amanda (as Aggie): We need to get to Dr. Morrow's right now.
Julia (as Val): Let's go!
[Music ends]
[Traffic noises]
Amanda: I'm gonna strap Milo in with the seat belt, [emphasising] where he should have been in the first place! To the cab of the truck, and Val you can fit in the middle seat if you want to.
Julia: I do fit in the middle seat.
Eric: The Knight of Mirrors pulls up and says
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Do you— do you need me to do anything?
Amanda (as Aggie): You actually came in very handy, thank you.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I told you I'm one of the good guys!
Eric: Yeah Aggie you slam on the gas ,and the truck like a fish tails a little bit in the mud, and you are driving into Lake Town City with your first big capture.
[Suspenseful techno music fades in]
Eric: Milo while you're passed out, you're laying on the ground and it's so soft and you look around and you're on orange shag carpet, and there's this orange shag carpet as far as the eye can see, and everything else is just white nothingness and standing in front of you in it's almost a robe but also like it could be a kimono with a hood up shadowing the face. You see that an arm is reaching out to you and it's the same ghostly arm that keeps messing with you during your spirit surge. You hear in a voice only from 1960s and 1970s horror movies say
Eric (as voice): [Voice reverbs as he speaks] We’re gonna spend a lot more time here.
Eric: And you wake up to Tuna on your chest being like
Eric (as Tuna): [Excitedly] So how'd it go?
[Julia and Amanda laughing]
[Music fades]
Eric: Wow we're now finally on the beach and January is hopping around with those frozen pina coladas on a little tray because we made it to the downtime portion! Our first one of campaign two!
Amanda: Ooo.
Julia: Can we go to a hot springs?
Eric: It's a metaphorical hot spring, it's like in your mind. Wonderful alright well we're at our first down time I'm very excited to do this because I have a lot of fun things planned for all of you. But the way that we're going to do this I really wanted to separate each arc into seasons, so this would happen during the fall this was happening during like the peak of fall I think in September when we first met in the first episode so—
Amanda: Oh yeah a field trip so early in the year? Those kids were so lucky in episode one.
Julia: Nice.
Eric: Like you gotta just get it out of the way early, it's mandatory. So we're going to move through the rest of the months of fall, and we're eventually gonna end up in winter. But I think first thing’s first: hey you all leveled up!
Brandon: Yay we did!
Eric: Everyone is level 5 so why don't all of you tell me the new hot shit that you have that make you stand out, let's start with Amanda!
Amanda: Yes so in addition to some ability score modifiers, I no longer have -1 charisma I’m now at 0 modifier.
Eric: Ayy.
Amanda: I got a couple of cool new things, I got 2 more ki points because you have a number equal to your level, so I now have 5. I got extra attack so in addition to being able to like use my martial arts thing to make an unarmed strike as a bonus action I can just fully do attacks without using up my bonus action which is sick!
Brandon: God that's badass!
Amanda: And I get slow fall so I can use a reaction when falling to reduce any falling damage I take by my monk level times five.
Eric: That’s amazing. So it's just gonna be a lot of Aggie jumping off of buildings in the next—
Brandon: I’m into that.
Julia: I’m so for it.
Amanda: I’m in.
Eric: Let's do Ghoulia!
Julia: Cool um so I took both of my ability score points, and put them into charisma so I have +2 charisma now! That's fun.
Eric: Ayy.
Julia: Ayyy the most charismatic little punk there's ever been!
Eric: Just a lot of intimidation happening.
Julia: There is! I have +5 to intimidation now!
Eric: Good!
Amanda: That’s awesome.
Julia: I also got an extra attack just like Aggie did, and I have fast movement which my speed is increased to 40. Boom boom.
Eric: Hell yeah!
Brandon: Nice!
Eric: And then Milo, what you got?
Brandon: I got all the normal stuff, I put my ability to score modifiers into wisdom so now my spell casting is a +7.
Eric: Dangerous.
Brandon: And my big thing is I get two new spells from my class, which are the first one is gaseous form which I transform a willing creature when I touch everything it's wearing and carrying into a misty cloud for the duration which is very cool so basically I get to turn people into a ghost! And then my second spell is animate dead which is fucking wild! I get to basically make a skeleton or a zombie and have it be my buddy for a little bit.
Julia: Yikes.
Eric: From what I understand of Milo, I'm sure he's going to deal with that responsibly.
Julia: Definitely.
Brandon: Yeah 100%
Julia: Definitely not going to be terrified of his own creation.
Brandon: Of course not! And he's definitely not going to use this guy to just antagonize Tuna the whole time.
Eric: Oh god yeah, there's definitely the time where you're messing around, and then you're like walking around in a park and all of a sudden like a skeleton like climbs out because it was like buried on an old graveyard, and Tuna is just like “AHHHHHHH!”
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: Yep!
Eric: But it's fall and it's beautiful. Alright! Well we did discuss that you three are taking on a super heroic bent to how you are dealing with the rest of this story, so I think first things first and I am not privy to this, at one point I think Dr. Morrow calls a whiteboard meeting for everybody. She rolls out like a giant whiteboard that like fills an entire wall of a room she's like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright well we can just go— let's discuss your code names, what you might want to look like, maybe I can bring in a brand consultant if you'd like, just how do you want to look as you reveal yourself to the public? We're not gonna have a press conference or anything because this is still a secret government experiment, but I think you could look cool we could try to make you look groovy.
Brandon (as Milo): Do I have to look “groovy”
Julia (as Val): Yes, you specifically have to look groovy.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Whatever the kids are saying you know if you're looking lit and fizzy. I don't know are the kids saying.
Julia (as Val): What is fizzy?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I heard fizzy, I heard one of the interns say fizzy. Like you're popping.
Brandon (as Milo): I prefer floofy.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No that sounds like something that's not true. I wouldn't know—
Eric: I like the thing that this is in Dr. Morrow's study, so this is the one that's like a park an artificial park, so like you're sitting in a park and there's just like a giant whiteboard. And all of you are like sitting on really nice like outdoor chairs while someone else is giving a presentation. It's like you're in a really holistic high school.
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): So um a little bit uncertain about this one, I never wore halloween costumes as a kid, because I'm nervous it'll be wrong. So my idea you know, if I didn't end up being the caretaker here I was gonna enroll in the national park service, so you know that that cut out of Smokey the Bear in in the road leading Tupper lake? I think—I think I want to be like The Preserver. Preserver if you want to get direct to it—
Brandon (as Milo): Ohh, that’s good!
Amanda (as Aggie): And um be here for making sure that our land, and our people are preserved from harm. I don't know, I was thinking like maybe like a jumpsuit, something like that maybe like forest green, some some kind of I don't know cool hat help you know on my my face shadowing a little bit, and um yeah I don't— I don't know that was just um that was just my idea so uh I just… Thanks.
Julia (as Val): Well I love it, I think that like it's great because you preserve us, because you do that anti-punch thing—
Brandon (as Milo): OH I GET IT!
Julia (as Val): But also preserve because you punch the people who are doing bad stuff, I love it! It's great!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah okay thanks, Val, that's great.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You know when you said Smokey the Bear I was worried because Smokey the Bear usually has no shirt canonically, just pants and hats.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm also not a bear, so I thought we were going a little bit like artistic with these references. But yeah, like a mechanic meets Smokey the Bear is kind of what I'm going for.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I do like the hat. It is interesting, we could turn that into a I can work on a sort of uh James Bond odd job situation where they could have a blade on it that could be interesting.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh that could be very cool, that could sort of be like my version of darts and kind of throwing it and boomeranging or something like that, yeah.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I think that would be really interesting. Would you like a Smokey the Bear style hat? Where it's like rounded on all sides so because that might give you the most amount of uh being able to throw it and then coming back and you being able to catch it as if it was a boomerang.
Amanda (as Aggie): I thought the wide brim would be good for kind of obscuring my face a little bit I could have one of those you know things over my eyes as well to to obscure that part of my face, but yeah I think the the wide brim it's it's important you get sun damage out every single day unless you put on your spf moisturizer, and most people don't!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah—
Julia (as Val): Would you like to add like a flannel aspect to this too? Because I think it goes with your whole look. I don't know.
Amanda (as Aggie): Maybe in like the the colder months, we can have like a flannel, you know external jacket or like a flannel lined overcoat maybe the jumpsuit is lined in flannel, and then we have a cotton version for the summer, with a little accent on the sleeves, and the the collar.
Eric: Listen that's just thinking ahead, that's just smart.
Amanda: It gets cold! Got to have your layers, long underwear!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright yeah Preserver! Let's put it on the board!
Eric: And she writes Preserver up at the top.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright uh who wants to go next? Val you're already standing.
Julia (as Val): Oh yeah, okay I wasn't sure, I wanted to be polite to Milo in case he was very excited about his superhero gig.
Brandon (as Milo): I appreciate that you know presentations in front of people just aren't—like when it's not you know at a museum with an exhibit behind me that I've studied. It's not my thing.
Julia (as Val): I was gonna ask, because you literally had— like that is your job but it's fine.
Eric: Dr. Morrow is like looking down at a an iPad that she's switching through and she’s like
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yes I've seen that according to my notes, you have a negative one to charisma.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia (as Val): So here's the thing, I do like leather jackets. I know that is like a surprise to everyone here. But I think that you know we could make a superhero that also has a leather jacket, I think that is like an appropriate thing, maybe we could have some sort of emblem on the front or whatever, and then I really like the idea— you know I have the little spikes on this one. But what if I had big spikes like big—
Amanda (as Aggie): I like that idea.
Julia (as Val): Big spikes on the shoulders!
Brandon ( as Milo): I love it!
Julia (as Val): Very cool right?
Amanda (as Aggie): No pigeons are gonna sit on your shoulders.
[Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): Exactly!
Brandon (as Milo): no skateboarders are gonna grind on your shoulders!
Julia (as Val): Exactly! No one can mess with my shoulders! And also I can use them as weapons!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): So Val what I'm understanding here is you want to look a lot like what you're wearing now, and also there's some sort of mask situation [laughing] happening.
Julia (as Val): I like that maybe like a utility belt? I don't know if I need a utility belt, that might be more of a Milo thing, he seems like he would have gadgets and gizmos, I don't know.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: [Singing] I got gadgets and gizmos of plenty!
Brandon (as Milo): That is my middle name, Milo Gadget Gizmo Lane.
Eric: Milo's rooting through his bag and he's like “thingamabobs? I have 20!”
[Brandon laughing]
Julia (as Val): But like yes I i would like to look the way that I currently look, but like more badass so bigger spikes maybe we'll do red instead of black for the leather jacket, and you know just some pants I could go for leather pants too, my ass looks good. But I also don't want them to be super tight on me you know what I mean?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You can provide your own leather pants.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia (as Val): I wasn't sure if that's like a tactical thing that you could give me, like a cool tactical leather pants.
[Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): You're laughing Dr. Morrow but that's a thing!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No you're— it will be harder to put pockets on them as opposed to Aggies situation but I think that there is something there.
Brandon (as Milo): You can make science space gadgets but you can't put pockets on other pants?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Milo you know as much as I do that physics only goes so far.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia (as Val): Anyway I like this look, and then I was thinking because like I explode sometimes with anger, and also like things happen, I was thinking something like Vulcani
[Everyone ooo’s] Eric (as Dr. Morrow): As the name Vulcani.
Brandon (as Milo): No like you don't explode in anger.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Nooo.
Amanda (as Aggie): But within you is the potential to level a city. If that's okay to say. I mean as a compliment.
Julia (as Val): Yes, I also all I have right now are my fists, and sometimes I have brass knuckles so if I could do something with that that would be very cool, but currently I am fine with just punching as I am.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Interesting yeah these are all definitely things we can work on in the future. I did see you had a note did you like draw any of these up just from—
Julia (as Val): Yes!
Julia: There's like a sketchbook that Val presents like
Julia (as Val): Here's my ideas— they're terrible drawings! They're awful drawings.
Eric: Dr. Morrow’s flipping through and there's just like a stick figure with sunglasses on, and it says like”disguise face?”
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well what we could do is you could wear some sort of fake some sort of eyewear that would do a similar thing to a traditional domino mask which I think would fit more for Aggie who would have the hats in a basket combo there, I bet we can I'm sure we can put some eyewear together to disguise your your identity.
Julia (as Val): Very cool okay.
Eric: She writes all this down, she rips out your drawings and puts it in her pocket.
Julia: Very good.
Eric: And uh she writes Volcani I like that. Alright Milo! What do you have?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Now Milo you have been sending me images every day, but you've really been bouncing all over the place. So I really just want you to you narrow this down, I'm not really sure which one I should refer to.
Brandon (as Milo): You didn't—I mean you shot down the Wolverine thing, so I had—
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well that was just Wolverine.
Julia (as Val): You can't just be Wolverine.
Brandon (as Milo): Why not?!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): That is that is copyrighted, and we would have a problem.
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): Um yeah so I was thinking like maybe I could you know hide my face a lot and body a lot.
[Eric cackles]
Eric: [Laughing] All three of you are my favorite.
Brandon: [Bashfully] So I—I just I just texted you some images that I think might work, there's um Morpheus from the Sandman series, he's got a big cool cape that I like a lot with a big hood, and then I forgot this guy's name and he looks kind of like a roman centurion with a little like logo like an Iron Man logo on his chest maybe that's I mean where you could I could control where my my ghost friend comes from. And then like Wiccan, he kind of looks more like me, I'm not really like these big tall powerful guys so maybe you know this like futuristic suit, but with like big cape and hood? You know Wiccan’s pretty cool.
Julia (as Val): He also has like that space thing going on that you're all about too, so that's kind of cool.
Brandon: Yeah thanks— [realizes he’s been complimented] hey thanks!
Amanda (as Aggie): Those like ombre gloves, I'm really into it, I like it.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Interesting, so I think we have two major things here for Milo: one is face covered, but two: chest portal exposed.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I think so, I like that.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Interesting the vibes I'm getting from all three of these are very different like one looks like you said a roman centurion, and the other ones are more are very flowy and chill, and some of these are a little bit gothic and I know you you do deal with— well I personally don't believe in ghosts, but spirits.
Brandon (as Milo): Wh—what? You've seen them, I've showed you them!
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Doesn't mean I—i there has to be a better explanation. What kind of vibe are you going for?
Brandon (as Milo): Definitely not the roman centurion vibe, I just like his like chest plate thing more than I liked a terrible billionaire playboy asshole Iron Man capitalist his dumb chest thing.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): [Laughing] It's fair. Milo I've read your Twitter. I under— I know how you feel about Iron Man.
Brandon (as Milo): So I'm definitely more of like the the Wiccan vibe just with a bigger cape.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): With a bigger cape and face, and full face coverage?
Brandon (as Milo): I think the hood's big enough, I don't have to cover my face exactly you know?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah we could do that have a big cowl yeah, that could be interesting yeah alright.
Brandon (as Milo): And I think if I have the big chest thing like it's gonna direct attention away from the face and towards the chest you know?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): For sure.
Julia (as Val): That's true if you had a glowing chest I would look at that instead of your face.
Brandon (as Milo): Exactly.
Amanda: I wear green shirts for the same reason, I am told they bring out my eyes.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia (as Val): That’s adorable.
Brandon (as Milo): And then as for like a name, I mean like I'm just like spitballing here so please jump in. I was thinking something sciencey you know, like there's like a dark matter or like charmonium, or like I liked killanova a lot.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oooo.
Julia (as Val): Oh I like that one! That one! Yes.
Amanda (as Aggie): It sounds kind of like killer which is great.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah!
Julia (as Val): And also like stars and stuff because you like the space.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah you know it's a trend to an astronomical event that occurs in a compact binary system when two neutron stars or—
Julia (as Val): Yeah mhm.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yep.
Brandon (as Milo): [Still rambling] neutron star and black hole merge into each you know? And they emit short gamma—
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yes Milo, we know what a kilonova is.
Julia (as Val): We definitely do.
Amanda: Val and Aggie make direct eye contact.
Julia: Just make faces at each other.
Brandon (as Milo): [Has not stopped talking] they emit gamma ray bursts like I burst things out of my chest you know.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Kilanova—
Brandon (as Milo): Kilonova was also they were just also just discovered after the ligo experiment so they're like you know a recent astrological phenomenon that we just discovered so like it's new and it's fresh you know.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yes Milo we all know what a kilonova is, I said—
Amanda (as Aggie): I also bet you could get that handle on Instagram.
Julia (as Val): Yeah that would probably be pretty easy.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yes the only thing I was going to ask if Val please check into your database where you keep all of your band names, just make sure that's not taken. But other than that a—
Julia (as Val): Kilanova no cause I don't listen to fucking nerd bands.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright wonderful I love it.
Eric: So we have Preserver, Vulcani, and Kilonova. Oh those—
Julia: Oh that is a dope team name, I gotta say.
Eric: It is a dope team name.
Brandon: Oh do we need a team name?
Julia: No.
Eric: We could—yeah if you would like a team name, I don't know if we necessarily need one.
Brandon: The Y-Men!
Julia: No.
Eric: Well we can see—
Brandon: The Z-Men!
Eric: Terrible. We can see as people respond to you, you know we are not like I said we're not going to do like a formal thing last year yeah because this is going to be a little bit more under the radar, so I don't feel like you need to— we have to come up with all this ourselves.
Brandon: That's cool it'll also stick better when other people say it.
Amanda: I feel like making one might invite more speculation as to our origins and who we are, so I think just going out with our our personas would be a good idea.
Eric: Yeah wonderful I really like that.
[Transition note]
Eric: Hey it's Eric, it's August so you know what that means, It's heirloom tomato season! Just get those wrinkly boys they're green, or yellow, or red, and they look like your grandfather and you chop into them, and you salt them or you put them on a piece of crispy toast with like a thin layer of mayo, or you put it on a cheese sandwich, or put it on your eggs or any sandwich I just also love sandwiches and heirloom tomatoes, so just do that. Listen, August is usually terrible all therapists disappear, it's so hot and so muggy but at least we have heirloom tomatoes! Welcome to the midroll, just like salt them and the water comes out and it's just so good.

If you listen to Join the Party I bet you love serialized fiction that brings something fresh to a beloved genre. So if you haven’t listened to Arden, a comedy-mystery podcast loosely based on a different Shakespeare play every season. The first season followed a journalist and a detective as they worked together to solve the 10-year-old disappearance of a Hollywood starlet. Season two, which just wrapped up this week, takes the duo to Montana, where they get too close to the mystery surrounding the unresolved death of a rancher.

And now, back to the show![Transition note]
Eric: After a few days Dr. Morrow like takes photos of all the notes, and writes some more stuff down, and I think that you all get packages that show up at your door a few days later. Aggie you open up your package I don't know how she got everyone's measurements but Dr. Morrow has them.
Amanda: Oh I'm sure she's got like a biometric scanner when you cross the threshold.
Brandon: Yeah that's creepy AF! Eric: But like in a nice way, it's for good things Aggie I think that you get pretty much exactly what you asked for, there was a tailored forest green jumpsuit with like secret pockets everywhere, like there are a few you can see but then there's like very small ones that lay flat on the fabric and these like black they're like somewhere in between an army boot and a working boot like it's a very sleek sturdy boot, and you get a a very small domino mask and there is a park rangers hat it might be even more a little bit more angular, like in the in my head of a park rangers hat is like really like puffy and like rounded but this one is like has like edges almost. It looks like if someone tried to render it in a video game, so it looked like sleeker and cooler.
Amanda: Cool!
Eric: And as you pick up the park rangers hat you nick your thumb on the brim, and as you look at it there's just like a razor's edge.
Amanda: Aggie whispers
Amanda (as Aggie): Fashion.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: I wonder if the edge can be almost serrated so that like parking spikes, like if you go around it counterclockwise your fingers are just smooth over the burrs and then if you go the other way they cut.
Eric: Oh yeah!
Amanda: So if I throw it and it's going clockwise as I throw, then there you go but if it I like drop it and Sushi licks it like it's okay.
Eric: Yeah no that's great I love that yeah. Val you take it out and you're like “did my dad drop this off again? Like he's always just buying me stuff from New York City” and then you realize you're looking at this like a blood red oxblood leather jacket, there's just like really defined spikes on them.
Julia: Oh I'm so happy!
Eric: And it's like a new pair of leather pants with a note in like a pocket that says “feel free to wear your own, but here are some new ones if you want to break them in!”
Julia (as Val): Tight, thank you.
Eric: And looking around in the bottom there's a black glasses case and you pop them open and they're like if there was a way to make Oakley's look cool, this would be the way to do it.
Julia: Hooo, sick burn on Oakley's and everything in the late 2000’s.
Brandon: Got em!
Eric: Well we're in 202X, so they're definitely out of style. It's like it has the reflective lenses and you can whatever color you'd like—
Julia: Yeah I was thinking red to yellow to purple.
Eric: Yes!
Brandon: Nice.
Eric: It was like when you are on PowerPoint when you do the sunrise color gradients.
Amanda: [Laughing] I know exactly what you mean!
Eric: Bang bang yeah Amanda! There are a bunch of people that's like “oh fuck yeah dude!” Alright and then Milo you open up your package. And Milo wears t-shirts, and he wears jeans, and converse, and this is just like this is something else this is a new choice for you.
Brandon: Oh no.
Eric: There's—it's very flowy I think that there's there's an opportunity for you again to wear your own clothes underneath, but the things that you pick up are just this heavy midnight blue almost black, like when you look up into the stars and you see that you know there's the presence of no light but you catch like little glimpses of color of like really dark dark purples, and blues, and like there's even like bruised green in there. So what you really have is this cowl that gives you a very like deep hood for you to put your head in and then reaches all the way down to your waist and like dangles a little bit below that and there's also like there's a tactical shirt underneath, it kind of just looks like what could be an under armour athletic shirt, but you can tell you there's like actually some weight to it and there's a hole right in the center for where your ghost portal might go. You look at the cowl you can see that like on the hood there's also some fabric ,and even like some like glass or some sort of reflective bits in it so as you put it on and you look at yourself in the mirror it's like it's refracting some sort of light so your entire face is just covered in shadow.
Brandon: Sick.
Julia: It's very cool.
Eric: And in every single one of your packages, there is a very like ornate place card. Like you might find for yourself at a wedding, there's these incredibly gaudy like loops and calligraphy swooshes to it, with your names on it with Preserver in dark green, with Vulani in dark red, and in dark blue Kilonova. And then as you open it you'd be like January made these he really wanted to try out some new calligraphy pens. I think it came out pretty good.
Amanda: January!
Julia: Yeees!
Brandon: January is the hero of this entire story.
Eric: Alright hell yeah! Well you are now unleashed onto the city to go fight some crime, so I want to give you some chances to build out some people to rough and tumble with!
Brandon: Eric, I do want to say just for everyone who is curious in the listening audience, the first thing that Milo did was put on his hood, turn into a ghost, and scare Tuna.
Julia: Excellent
Eric: Very good, thank you for canotically hitting that. I appreciate it. Alright, wonderful so we're going to do something that I’ve come up with that I think I want to do every single down time, which is called the Enemy Entanglement Chart, where you're going to get a chance to go fight some crimes! So they're going to be some very quick interactions with some villains that are coming down onto Lake Town City, so everyone is gonna get a chance to lead one of these, but all three of you are gonna be together during one of these entanglement conflicts. So the way that it works is that I have a table here, and the person who's the leader is going to roll a d10 three times, and then I'm going to set up the entanglement and I'm going to roll on behalf of the villain, and you three are going to swoop in with your leader, and then do an action to fight that villain. Depending on who wins this contested roll, you're gonna have narrative control of what happens. So basically depending on like what happens if it's like a 1 to a 2, the winner narrowly wins if it's like a 4 to a to an 8 it's gonna be a successful win, and like 9 or above it's gonna be like a runaway win, you really get clobbered and whoever wins like wins cool.Amanda: Gotcha.
Eric: Okay so is everybody ready? Yeah alright who wants to go first?
Julia: I'll go first alright so the order here is the first roll is going to be the villain, the second role is going to be the place, and the third role is going to be the scheme they are doing.
Brandon: This is very cool!
Julia: I'm weirdly nervous rolling this.
[Upbeat arcade music fades in]
Julia: Okay first roll 4.
Eric: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: 5, and another 5.
Amanda: Colonel Mustard, in the library.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Amazing.
Julia: Oh god I'm so nervous.
Eric: It is October, and the NHL schedule is in full swing, the Mountain Lobsters are playing the Nashville Predators and the Mountain Lobsters look real good this year, they're already up to a 2-0 lead, and it is the intermission in between the first and second period. Usually— I wonder what song they play, I guess it's just like top 40 hits, like people are off like getting food they're going to the bathroom. But then it all goes silent and the the arena goes dark—
Amanda: And you can hear each other peeing in the bathroom.
Julia: Oh no!
Brandon: The truest evil!
Eric: And a giant spotlight points down right in the center of the ice, which is strange because there is no giant spotlight that would be in there, and then another spotlight points down and another one, and there's just like now 10 spotlights are pointing down into the center of the ice. And there's a man with goggles and a white coat holding a what looks like a qualcomm tablet, and is holding like an oversized glowing stylus pen. He draws on the stylus which then creates a microphone, and then he draws more and there's just like sketches of speakers behind him, and he that grabs the microphone he's just drawn and says
Eric (as man in goggles): [Voice echoes through the arena] Everyone bow to the power of Professor Transform! No one has taken me seriously before, but I will destroy this to demonstrate my own power! Everyone cower at the sketching ability of Dr. Transform and his magical photoshop program!
Brandon (as Milo): Maybe it's because your name is Dr. Transform…
Julia (as Val): I was gonna say that's a terrible name, of course no one took you seriously.
Brandon (as Milo): A terrible name.
Amanda (as Aggie): Maybe we should become superhero persona consultants, it could be a good side income! I don't know, supplement your pension!
Eric: So Julia how do you how do you all three run in and burst in?
Julia: Dom Five is the biggest Mountain Lobsters fan of all time so Val heard about the thing over like the radio or whatever because he was listening to the game at the the pizzeria.
Eric: Yeah!
Julia: So we come running in, and oh god the ice is so slippery but—
[Amanda and Brandon laughing]
Julia: The ice is just so slippery and Val's just like “how am I gonna how am I gonna fight on ice that's gonna be terrible” and then um Val uses the charger feat, so just zips forward and like slides directly past this dude, but ends up like bouncing off of the walls of the rink, and then like whacking him from behind. Because I'm going so fast he can't follow.
Eric: I love that. Alright so Julia, Professor Transform has a tablet that can warp the fabric of space and time, so he has a +5 to this roll, but since you're using the charger feat I want you to make an attack roll, and can use your proficiency bonus.
Julia: Great.
Eric: Remember you have +3 now to your proficiency bonus.
Julia: Yeah I do!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: That's a 24.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Oooh baby.
Eric: Alright well I rolled a six so I got an 11, and you got a 24. So tell me how you thrash this dude.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: I—[starts laughing] I think I just like kind of push him to the ground like a bully,
[Brandon and Amanda laugh]
Julia: And then I stomp on his tablet—
Amanda: Oohh no.
Eric (as Professor Transform): OH NO, I’M NOTHING WITHOUT MY TABLET!
Julia: And then I and then I kind of like grab him by the coat, and spin him around, and slide him into the goal.
Amanda: Yay!
Julia: And then the goal alarm goes off.
Eric: And the alarm goes off [makes weew weew weew noises] because it's just programmed whenever there's a goal, it goes [singing] “we are the champions my friends”
Julia: And then Val just kind of jams to that.
Eric: And the entire crowd is just like “you suck, you suck!”
Brandon: And then maybe the zamboni comes out and just pushes the guy across the ice.
Amanda: The next day the newspaper headline “Score One for the Home Team!”
Eric: Oh yeah there's like a local tv station like a channel seven and a half that's just like
Eric (as news anchor): [Muffled through a tv] The Mountain Lobsters home team got an assist from another masked hero!
Amanda: Good good.
Julia: I need to know his name.
Eric (as news anchor): I'm Marjoram Sweet!
[Julia laughing]
Brandon: Oh jesus christ.
Eric: His name is Marjoram Sweet, everyone just covers a Marge. Who wants to go next?
Amanda: I'll go next!
Eric: Alright Amanda, roll 3d 10!
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 6, 7, and a 3!
Eric: This is on Halloween, and unfortunately it's a Wednesday, so everyone is going to work in their costumes. Even the Skytram it’s just like a constant costume party, including former Vice President Al Gore who is going as—
Amanda: Oh no…
Eric: Who is going as Captain Planet.
Julia: Oh my god I'm so happy right now.
Eric: He still goes to work on the Skytram because he is a—
Amanda: Man of the people!
Eric: Man of the people, and he goes from his house to downtown, as he gets on the Skytram he says
Eric (as Al Gore): Wow it's lucky for me nobody's on this one!
Eric: And he walks onto the Skytram.
[Everyone starts saying no]
Eric: Five tall men run in after him and all of them are wearing white basketball jerseys, and shorts and as former Vice President Al Gore looks up, they all have ski masks on. So one of them pushes him up against the wall and is like
Eric (as Masked Man): Vice president Al Gore, I didn't vote for you. I'm not a hanging chad, and we're kidnapping you. Cause we're the Crime Jam Family!
[Everyone laughing]
Brandon: What?!
Eric: And what and one of them gives former Vice President Al Gore a basketball that has like a comically oversized wick on it, so it's just like one of those like cartoonish bombs that are is painted like a basketball.
Julia: Oh my god.
Brandon: That's very good.
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric: So you three you're going up against Crime Jam. [Singing] Come on and slam! And do a crime and jam! Amanda how do you find out about this? How do you bust in?
Amanda: I think either us, or Dr. Morrow has some social media alerts set up, and so when we see the kids exclaiming about like— Skytram's one of the search words, and there are a lot of complaints that we feed to the appropriate offices and make sure that all the stops are served properly. Yeah but we get wind of this happening, and it is a short emergency skytram ride away, so all of us hop on the tram— it's so efficient why doesn't every city in America have this? And we get to the stop that the tram is going toward fairly quickly.
Eric: Absolutely I think that at this point like Vice President Al Gore is tied up and now they're trying to record a ransom video like
Eric (as Crime Jam thug): If you don't put up points, and by points I mean money, right now Vice President Al Gore is gonna get slammed into the ground. Aggie what do you and the team do?
Amanda: So this is the order of operations, all of us are at the stop that the skytram is coming towards, so it's like you know a few feet away, it's coming in to the station, and Milo is down by like the access point to the tracks like right closest to where the tram will start to pass them by. Milo turns former Vice President Al Gore into a gaseous cloud so he is less vulnerable to damage, and busts out the bonds. And I yell at these hooligans and make fun of their jerseys, so they throw more smaller baseball painted bombs at me, and being a monk I use my deflect missiles to stop them by holding my hand out they freeze in midair, and then turn right around and fly back into the skytram where they all kind of like hit them in the heads and then poof to the ground.
Eric: Wonderful alright so I'm gonna roll on behalf of Crime Jam, who are just some tall dudes who have access to bombs so they're not that great. Please do a ranged attack roll to throw the bombs back at them.
Julia: Val turns to Milo and is like
Julia (as Val): Did you know that Aggie’s got like telekinesis? That's pretty cool.
Brandon (as Milo): I had no idea.
Julia (as Val): It’s extremely cool, right?
Brandon: Eric is there an average height guy who's just extremely accurate with the bombs?
Eric: Yeah there's one guy there this guy who's who's five six with the name Mugsy written on his jersey who's uh pointing everyone in the directions it seems like.
Amanda: That's only a 12.
Eric: Okay I rolled an 11, so you succeed but narrowly. So how does this go down?
Amanda: I think I got all but one of the bombs and one of them does explode near my feet and kind of knocks me sideways, and Al Gore is understandably surprised and sort of like isn't sure where to go, and the guys are stunned, and the cloud is there and eventually we get them sorted out where Val and I are able to go in there tackle them to the ground, tie him up and Milo takes care of making corporeal again the former vice president but it's a narrow thing and there was a real chance that the skytram could have fallen off the tracks, or that some of the bombs would have killed either the attackers or me.
Eric: Yeah this was pretty dangerous, and skytrain is shut down for like a week, and it's really bad. People are kinda pissed. On News 7 ½ Marjoram Sweet says
Eric (as Marjoram Sweet): The skyway to the highway is blocked for now, because of some basketball bombs, and we're not talking about the NBA here, we're talking about crime!
Eric: I think this one is not even credited towards you, I think they focus more on Vice President Al Gore being safe, and the destruction and backup of skytram.
Brandon: I mean that's the real story Al Gore turns into ghost, that's the story.
Eric: Al Gore magically gets out of bonds.
Amanda: I think it really gave him incredibly even more compassion for global warming, and the plight of the oceans, yeah being a cloud really understands the whole water cycle in a way he didn’t before.
Julia: I’m proud of Al Gore!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Alright Brando! Roll them d10s!
Brandon: Okay!
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 2, 2, and 9!
Eric: This is now like mid-November, we're coming up on Thanksgiving, and it's another day in downtown LTC, and we see a armored van going to First National and then driving out to another bank to deliver some cash theoretically, and there's just like a retired police sergeant who is like 70 and working for the armored truck company, and it's early, he's drinking a coffee but he's done this run like 15 times before. So he comes up on an intersection there's a pedestrians that walk by and he takes a sip, and he looks up and there's one particularly strange looking man who's just like seems to be made out of dirt or clay, and he was “eh, weird things happen downtown.”
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: And then he has a buddy and there are two of them, and then he takes another sip of his coffee, and he looks up and there's four, and now ten and they're not clay, it seems to be like terra cotta. Like they're terracotta warriors, and then surround the armored car, one throws open the door and throws them out on the street, and they bust open the back, and you see that there is like in traditional shogun armor with a mask and a katana walks up between the army of terracotta warriors, and throws open the back door and he takes off his mask and it's just like a 35 year old white guy.
[Julia groans]
Amanda: Not again.
Eric (as katana guy): The Emperor has always known there are secrets here, secrets that have been buried in First National Bank! But I, The Emperor, with my traditional chinese knowledge—
Amanda: Oh that's not— oh those don't even go together.
Julia: Oh boy…
Eric (as The Emperor): I'm gonna learn it!
Eric: And he roots around in there, and he like throws there's like piles of money that he'll just like throws off to the side, and then he picks up a manila folder, and he kisses it, and he’s like
Eric (as The Emperor): Ah yes, the crown jewel. I knew it was here.
Eric: Milo how do you three bust in?
Brandon: So the three of us are planning our Friendsgiving, and we're at the grocery store next to First National, picking out the heritage breed turkey that we're going to have.
Eric: Yeah you called ahead—
Julia (as Val): Milo you have an antipasto platter, I don't know what to tell you! You have to have one!
Brandon (as Milo): They’re out of buffalo mozzarella! What do you want me to do!?
Julia (as Val): Then do like the pre-order or get the burrata!
Amanda: Aggie's there eating like a green olive for the first time like
Amanda (as Aggie): This is pretty good! It's pretty good!
Brandon: And then we hear the like vague threats of a horrible white man from across the street, cause those can be heard at any distance, and we're gonna run over there to help, and I think
[Brandon starts laughing]
[Everyone goes oh no]
Brandon: Milo sees this situation where there's like these tons of little like uh terracotta warrior guys, and Milo's like
Brandon (as Milo): Oh there's so many of them!
Brandon: And he's gonna cast animate dead on all of the meat carcasses in the grocery store.
Julia: Oh my god.
Amanda: What the fuck?!
Julia: Oh my god?!
Brandon: [Laughing] And he's gonna call Tuna and have Tuna be the general for this army of the undead meat products,
Eric: Amazing alright Milo what is your arcana?
Brandon: +4.
Eric: Okay cool yeah, I think [laughs] for this up for this yeah, I'm gonna roll +4 because The Emperor is pretty has a lot of terracotta warriors, so you're going to roll your arcana. So we're going to go up against each other.
Brandon: Cool.
[Dice rolling]Brandon: I got a 12 +4 for 16.
Amanda: Okay!
Julia: Pretty good, it's pretty good.
Eric: Yeah, I rolled a nat20.
Julia: Fuck!
Amanda: Oh shit.
Julia: This is the one guy we didn't want to win!
Amanda: I know we could have made nice with Professor Transformer! Or whatever he was called.
Julia: I could have not bullied Professor Transformer.
Eric: Yeah so the entire I think like the entire meat aisle just like comes stomping through the grocery store.
Julia: Just thinking about those turkeys waddling, ohh.
Brandon: Yeah and I think there's a cow or two, too.
Eric: Yeah and I think that the terracotta warriors like are scrapping, with like the turkeys and the chickens, and there's like they had a bunch of pigs that they ordered like full pigs that they ordered just in case people wanted them for Thanksgiving to do something non-traditional. And like there's a pig just running through like barreling through a terracotta warrior, and I guess you're watching Tuna lead the charge.
Brandon: It's glorious!
Eric: But you don't see The Emperor slip behind the battle line, and get you one-on-one, and he has his katana, and you know for someone who probably bought it at an anime convention, he's pretty good with it, and it's deadly. So he moves quicker than you anticipate, and slashes you across the chest. Before you get a chance to react from this incredibly quick sword slash he's disappeared and eventually the terracotta warriors just kind of fall over and crumble.
Amanda: And the animal spirits go free to live a happy, and peaceful life in the fields forever.
Eric: And the animal spirits go free.
Brandon: Of course, that's the next order we give them. So Milo plops on the ground and sort of like heaving and is like
Brandon (as Milo): Oh I was gonna entangle, we were gonna lecture him about his choices.
Julia (as Val): Yeah we probably should have.
Amanda: Aggie does some healing hands on you and shakes her head.
Eric: That night on 7 ½ News, Marjoram Sweet is about to report on the story, and then there's a man in a suit like comes on screen and taps him on the shoulder, and whispers into his ear and Marjoram Sweet says
Eric (as Marjoram Sweet): No news today! Strange!
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: What!?
Eric: I said Julia I said it was government secrets.
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: Very funny, alright.
Eric: So we are done with the entanglements, congratulations! You have three new enemies, you put away Professor Transform, Crime Jam they did get away but Vice President Al Gore thanks you, and The Emperor is still at large.
[Upbeat arcade music fades out]
Eric: Let's move a little bit forward. It is now Thanksgiving. It is the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and I think all of you can all be at your friendsgiving.
[Background party noises]
[Everyone yays!]
Brandon: Milo brought a pack of peanut butter chocolate stouts to share.
Julia: I'm assuming this is at Aggie's house because I have a studio apartment.
Amanda: Yeah totally
Eric: It's a really nice studio apartment though.
Julia: It is!
Amanda: And Tuna and Sushi are touching noses on my couch, as we prepare the food.
Brandon: Awww!
Julia: Extremely cute.
Eric: Just some cleaning up questions, so we haven't really touched on it but Ma and the Nephews, I think Dr. Morrow just said we'll take care of it from here as you drove up in Aggie's truck. Did you guys ever follow up with Emily?
Amanda: So I think—
Eric: You have to be honest but, I do I do want to know.
Amanda: Yeah I think Aggie the day after they met with Dr. Morrow, texted Emily and said like “listen, appreciate you getting us all together, I don't think we can work together, but I'm happy to stay in touch and I'm glad you texted me”
Eric: Emily texts you back and says “oh wow that's kind of surprising, I don't really see it the same way that you do. But I respect your opinion. smiley face”
Amanda: I think Aggie would have left it at that and just reported to the group thread what happened.
Brandon: At some point Milo ran into Emily at the grocery store and she confronted Milo and Milo was just like
Brandon (as Milo): Oh yeah, I dropped my— I broke my phone in a in a battle thing, and I had to get a new number…
Brandon: And then he turned into a gaseous cloud and runs away.
Eric: That’s fine.
Julia: [Laughing] You’re in a grocery store! What are you doing?! Mr. “The Ghost Didn’t Come Out of My Chest!”
Brandon: [Laughing] He like turns into like steam coming off of the hot bar.
Eric: Make a stealth roll for me bud.
Amanda: And then he smelled like broccoli for four weeks afterward.
Brandon: I got a nat 20!
Julia: Yay!
Amanda: Brandon, NOW?!
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Honestly, it’s fine, I get it.
Brandon: Whenever I have to get it out of an awkward situation, that's when I stopped.
Eric: I like that Emily's like: Milo disappears and she's like
Eric (as Emily): I really respect that guy.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Alright so Aggie I assume, how do you and your siblings keep in touch? We have a group Whatsapp because some of them live in different countries, and every permutation of siblings in their own group chats. So like I have one with each of them, and there's all three of us in all the combinations, there's like dozens, and dozens of group chats, and then one with our parents as well.
Eric: Cool I think that the main sibling group chat has just been blown up about like plans. I assume all of you are trying to meet up for Thanksgiving, yeah because it's a friendsgiving so this is before so you guys can do yeah you all have familial obligations, so I assume you were all going to do that. Also Hank deep fries a turkey so you're not going to want to miss that.
Brandon: He's only lit the lawn on fire once.
Eric: Aggie, the O'Hare sibling group chat blows up uh which quinn has renamed to “Bunnies” a few days ago and no one has had the heart to change it and Regan—
Amanda: Oh you mean my siblings Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn?
Eric: Yes, those. Regan posts a link to an Average Bear Reports article.
Julia: Uh-oh.
Eric: And the the headline is Lake Town City Super for More Ways Than One, and it's written by Tegan Murphy.
Brandon and Amanda: Oh no.
Julia: Val is just oblivious eating some manigot at the table.
[Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): Milo you want some? It's real good I made it myself!
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, hell yes! Fill me up! It's not Thanksgiving without manigot.
Amanda: I think Aggie looks at the message and then freezes, and puts her phone on the table for them to look at.
[Ethereal music fades in]
Eric (as Tegan): It's early November in Lake Town City when the compelling smells of hot apple cider, and a cold snap stalking down from Canada are perfumed throughout the city. The smell was everywhere in your clothes, your hair, your truck, but it could also linger in your cape, if you had one. I know this first hand as the cape of a Fly Boy tossed gently like a flag on a pole during a private conference in the auditorium of Lake Town City's tallest building. The Thornhill building flyboy hovered his feet constantly a few inches above the ground alongside a team of masked defenders.
Julia (as Val): Oh my— oh my god this is fucking Sour Anthony named himself Fly Boy?!
Brandon (as Milo): Fucking Sour Anthony.
Brandon and Julia (as Milo and Val): FLY BOY?!
Amanda (as Aggie):: That is the worst name I've ever heard.
Brandon (as Milo): Sour Anthony's a better name than that.
Eric (as Tegan): The leader, Emily Slaughter, leaned against the podium with her full weight and delivered a speech that it seemed she had practiced in the mirror for years.
Brandon (as Milo): Sounds right.
Eric (as Tegan): She touched on justice, peace, honor, and power but everyone's eyes were locked on the katana strapped to her back, radiating a soft purple glow, or maybe it was the perfectly trained moose, who she had introduced as Taxonomy—
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): What?!
Julia (as Val): Oh my god. That’s a better fucking name than Fly Boy though.
Eric (as Tegan): That belched a “right you are!” a in a Canadian accent—
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: This Milo laughing out loud.
Eric (as Tegan): When Slaughter hit a particularly prescient point, or once again it was the smell of leather from Fly Boy's bomber jacket and his fluttering cape.
Julia (as Val): Oh fucking—fucking Sour Anthony stealing my leather jacket! That's bullshit!
Amanda (as Aggie): Capes are so impractical! They are a risk!
Brandon (as Milo): Another jacket and a cape is tacky!
Eric (as Emily Slaughter): And that's why I've gathered you all here to formally introduce us: The Up Country Keepers anyone else of the powered variety who is here for the cause is welcome to join the Keepers and our cause.
Eric: Teagan then summarizes the rest of the conference, and there are some quotes from Emily the origin story of the Up County Keepers when they stopped a breakout attempt of the Nephews from jail and there's a quote of commendation from the Lake Town City chief of police, the mayor's office also gave a quote that said “we're not in the powered business we're in the city running business” but there was an emphasis Tegan notes to refer to the mayor as mayor Dr. Morrow.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Tegan): The writing continues: there must be something in the water up near Lake Town City what was once a sleepy summering town only a few short decades ago, is now a bustling metropolis.
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean they're not wrong.
Eric: Yeah Lake Town City pride! Go mountain lobsters!
Brandon: We have the cleanest water in all of the United states!
Amanda (as Aggie): We provide New York City its water. They really ought to respect that more.
Eric (as Tegan): And it seems to be constantly churning out a number of famous residents. Doctor Mayor Cassandra Morrow, of course hometown hero Fritz Brightstone of the NHL team the Mountain Lobsters, and let's not forget the O’Hare siblings.
Julia (as Val): Oh it's you!
Brandon (as Milo): Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice!
Eric (as Tegan): Photographer and local resident Danny is a guggenheim genius, Cassie has over a hundred thousand followers on her Instagram devoted to impossibly realistic tattoo designs, twins Regan and Ryan have two number one hits, and two gold medals between them in country music, olympic swimming, and the X Games if you're counting, Kelly is a working model and frequent RuPaul Drag Race judge, and Quinn is finishing her run as Vola in the Twelfth Night in Shakespeare in the Park. And of course there is Aggie, oldest sibling and official representative of the Historic Laketon district in the northern corner of Lake Town City. It was said that this was the place that Dr. Morrow discovered diaphram, the element that is the basis of so much technology we see today. But does diaphragm just make better people? “All I know is it's very fortunate to grow up in a place like this” Aggie said with a size she drove me around in an old school pickup truck “my siblings are really fortunate to have found stuff, and that they're good at that makes them proud a lot of olympic athletes by the way come from this town, lots of famous artists there are a lot of people who've gone on to academic careers, I found something I'm good at that makes me happy.”
Julia (as Val): Did you say all that?
Brandon (as Milo): Aggie, you don't even sound like that.
Amanda (as Aggie): I— no I they they showed up at my truck and I wasn't gonna just let them stand there on Main Street, I just took them around, and I didn't know. That was months ago!
Eric (as Tegan): Some of her siblings had a different idea “yeah man I ran around in a zero degree winter cold when I was five!” Said Ryan as I caught him for a few minutes in between laps. “I got in a sled when I was two and a half that's why I'm the way that I am, not some Lake Town City stuff” at this point he popped his shirt off and turned towards the pool he would soon do 10 rounds in hitting a new personal best.
Amanda (as Aggie): That's Ryan.
Eric (as Tegan): “The swimming you know, maybe it was from the water either way, I'm a specimen. Whether it's radiation or whatever, I'm crushing it. It's good for the sport, good for the world, someone's gotta crush it.”
Julia (as Val): Aggie, no offense, but your brother kinda sounds hot.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia (as Val): Just wanna put that out there
Amanda (as Aggie): He— Val, he’s a tool. I don't know if you wanna go there, but we can have a discussion.
Julia (as Val): Listen, so are like half the people that I've dated. But what do you know?
Eric (as Tegan): “uh you should ask Aggie about all this.” Quinn replied via email “she's the best at explaining it, and ask her how I should fix my toilet it's running again. She hasn't texted me back” when I replied that she hasn't texted me back either she said and I quote “lol”
[Everyone laughing]
Eric (as Tegan): But it's not all good things climbing out of the water, crime is on the rise, unnatural creatures have been seen in Lake Champlain and the woods beyond, and it's not all of these powered individuals are taking Emily Slaughter's side, coupled with the government site that up and vanished right before Lake Town City's boom, and the years of persistent rumors in Little Italy of a resurgence of organized crime make for some mysteries that are still waiting for an unmasking.
Eric: Teagan then points to the rise and falls of the docks in terms of organized crime, and the mount when the mountain lobster started being preserved, and how that changed the recent bank robberies including the First National Bank auction hit, and how they were stopped by the Upcountry Leepers and now we're at the final paragraph:
Eric (as Tegan): Questions still remain: is there a connection between the new masked fighters and the tradition of excellence in the city? Are the heroes meeting the new villains, or are the villains meeting the new heroic demand? and is this what Mayor Dr. Morrow always wanted as a new tomorrow? Or is it just another experiment that got out of hand?
Tegan Murphy is a New York City writer who has written for Esquire, GQ, and Teen Vogue they live in New York City with their three cats and five hedgehogs.
Brandon (as Milo): Before I get intense about this, Teagan's a good writer.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Tegan is a very good writer, and this is extremely damaging, but I want to read it again, because it was good.
Julia (as Val): Aggie have you tried the manigot yet? It's extremely good.
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't know what that is.
Brandon (as Milo): The potatoes au gratin are also my dad's recipe, and he's real proud of them.
Julia (as Val): Okay I'll try some of those!
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't have to know what it is to enjoy how it tastes I guess.
Eric: Nice and you have your wonderful weird blended friendsgiving. If this was a comic book, it's like you get one panel like looking out from the street into Aggie's house of just you three chowing down on this food, and then we look up at the tree which still has a few like fall leaves on it, and they finally all fall and it's truly starting to become winter. On upstate New York, you don't ask if it's going to snow, you ask how much, you ask how long. It is inevitable like time and taxes, and the cowboy and black being the bad guy. It doesn't matter what you want, what you're planning on or what you have already, you are going to get this snow. Because it's for your own good like nature intended. It's winter so you get a metric ton of snow, happy December the weather knows better, we are just humans with our limited capacity and only five fingers, the snow freezes the fall decay into place which makes the environment so much greener and sweeter when the spring breaks through. It is a break nature has a bigger plan in mind, even if it looks bad now it's mandatory. I'm sure there is a metaphor here for being a hero people think and they get distracted with love, and parking tickets, and hunger, and board games, and justice, and which superhero would be the best dancer. As E. E. Cummings once wrote probably while wearing two scarves and those crackly little heat pockets in both gloves and boots: the snow doesn't give a soft white damn whom it touches so stop asking it for empathy, and maybe this year you can receive it with open arms, and a ready written thank you card. And this year this winter for Lake Town City that big white everywhere there is a second present there is a big mouth growl a footprint to match and a splotch of sticky red on white.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party…
Eric: Val, Aggie and Milo talk out their options with Dr. Morrow. Will they be a secret strike force or full-fledged superheroes with masks and capes? Dr. Morrow tries to ease their fears, ensuring that regardless of what avenue they choose, their private identities will be as protected as possible and they’ll have her support. She introduces the party to Dez, gravel-voiced Research and Development engineer on staff, who introduces some wild items to compliment their choice. As each character looked into their own past: Milo receiving a comic book by his dad around the time he was adopted, one of the many times Aggie saves her younger siblings from danger, and teenage Val fighting bullies on the streets of New York, they decide to pull on the mask and be crime-fighting superheroes. So, who needs to be crime-fought? Do you? Let’s get the party started
[Theme music]
Eric: The three of you are standing around a tree in the Historic Lake Town district, it kind of looks like a regular tree, it's lost all of its leaves blowing away in the harsh upstate New York wind October is finally bearing down, and you're gonna have to wear like a jacket over your sweater if you're going to go outside now. There might be snow, who knows? But it's you almost feel like it's coming, it's like inside of your teeth, and your bones now and it's 11:00 P.M. and you're standing in front of a tree, and you do not understand what you have to do next. We flashed back 24 hours ago in Dr. Morrow's cabin where she has laid out blueprints of Laketon with the Nephews super secret underground lair, pretty much underneath everything.
Amanda (as Aggie): I know ice cream money can't pay for a lair like this what was this?
Julia (as Val): Sure you know the ice cream money?
Amanda (as Aggie): It's—it's dirty money, it's all sticky I don't know what to tell you.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): That is definitely what they mean by dirty money, you sweet sweet summer child.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh is that what they mean by money laundering too?
Julia (as Val): Yes, that's cleaning the money, exactly right!
Amanda (as Aggie): They're actually made of cotton. I don't know if you knew that but the currency is really fiber based and not paper based so.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Aggie there's an incredible point everyone knows this isn't butter pecan or it's some kind of genetically modified butter pecan.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't get the joke…
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You're right, it's not ice cream money. I was thinking about putting a bunch of money in a washing machine and I got distracted but let's we ought to—let's pull back
Eric (as Dez): Uh if you guys are gonna get distracted like this should like set up a whiteboard or something?
Julia (as Val): I would love a whiteboard, thank you for always thinking ahead.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah that'd be great!
Eric: Dez presses a button on their metal prosthesis, and it's just like it's a purple like hard light white board it's like a like a smart board you could draw on it.
Julia: I love Dez so much.
Eric: So Dr. Morrow continues:
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): This wasn't here recently, Aggie you make a good point, I don't know it wasn't there during the last land survey that we've done throughout the city. This was built recently, and we don't know how, and we don't know why we just know that it's bad.
Eric: Aggie can you make a history check?
Amanda: Yeah.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: An 8.
Eric: Um yeah, there's been some construction in historic Laketon, but nothing major usually it was just like to fix like a lighting pole. or put in uh the first stop sign.
Brandon: The first stop sign?!
Julia: Only one stop sign.
Eric: Yeah it was a really big deal. Ordinarily you wouldn't need stop signs, but then the city lobbied, and then it was putting the first stop sign, and it was a huge deal.
Brandon: That's wild!
Eric: There was a clambake to celebrate it.
Julia: I'm so proud.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): As you can see that we don't have an entrance, or an exit but we do have an idea that there could be a hidden one somewhere maybe just take a look around see if you see anything strange. What I need you three to do before we can give you tights, and a domino mask, and even cooler weapons for you to fight crime with. We need to clean up the goon element here we can't have Nephews running around when we're— I don't know trying to capture a snow ape running around in the tundra of the woods or something.
Brandon (as Milo): Is that a thing we're gonna have to do?
Julia (as Val): It is concerning that you know, your first thought goes to snow ape and not, I don't know robbers or something.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No we're going above and beyond that. Listen, I don't want to speculate on super villains, I'm not the great comic book publisher Action Stories.
[Amanda laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): Nailed it.
Julia (as Julia): So close to copyright infringement there but alright.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Listen don't tell them that I talked about them, they they're very litigious, but I just go off what I know. I'm sure there's a snow ape running around somewhere. So you three get in there figure out what's going on, how this is made, and clean up the mess, and don't worry I'm sure that you won't have a rocky road.
Brandon (as Milo): Wow… wowza…
[Julia groans]
Amanda (as Aggie): Gonna move right past that one, what do we do when we apprehend them?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): That's a good question, I don't know what do you what do you guys want to do?
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean turn them over to the police ideally.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's a good idea! Yeah!
Brandon (as Milo): Was that not your first instinct?!
Amanda (as Aggie): Do we have to explain anything? We put a note on their chest like a lost child?
[Eric and Brandon laugh]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No that's good! Yeah, yeah, if you tie them up, call 9-1-1 and then write a little note, they'll love that.
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't think they will love that but I will take your word for it.
Brandon (as Milo): You don't have like a secret like like red phone that goes directly to the chief police or anything?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): People have red phones to call me. I don't have red phones to call them.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay…
Amanda: Aggie’s a little starstruck, that's a really good line.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: It's very good, no question.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Milo I could give you a red phone to call me whenever you'd like.
Brandon (as Milo): I would love it!
Julia (as Val): Don't, don't do that.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It's not an actual red phone I guess you could just in your phone you can put a contact that says “red phone.”
Brandon (as Milo): Well if you're not going to give me a red phone, then I don't want a phone.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): On your actual phone. I'm not going to buy you a samsung and then I'm the only contact in it.
Brandon (as Milo): My phone's not red, so I don't know what we're doing here.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): But if the contact said “Red Phone” you would know what it is, and then it would be like a secret.
Julia (as Val): We could just get him like a red case for his phone, just a thought.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh that'd be cool! Yeah! Oh I like that I could mail— ooo yeah!
Brandon (as Milo): But then I would call other people it wouldn't be a phone directly to you, so what's the point?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Alright [Eric laughs] I can get you a burn— there could be a burn— alright here's what we're gonna do, Milo I will buy you a Cricket Wireless burner, I will paint it red, I will give it to you, and now then when I give it to you I'll say “only use this for emergencies” but then i'll wink how's that?
Brandon (as Milo): I would love that, yeah.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay remind me in like two weeks. Just give me— in two weeks remind me about this.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay!
Brandon: And Milo takes out his phone, and types a note in.
Eric: [Laughing] Brandon I expect you to write this down as a note so you remind me in two weeks.
Brandon: Oh I already am.
Eric: Okay good.
Amanda: Can I take a look at the plans before we leave and investigate them?
Eric: Yeah absolutely! All of you can do an investigation check on the plans.
Julia: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Ooh! That's a good roll.
Amanda: That is a 14 for me.
Brandon: I got a 15 plus one for a 16.
Eric: Nice.
Amanda: If you’ll recall Eric, with my superpower I do get more details when I inspect floor plans, or the exteriors of buildings.
Eric: That's right that's a good point.
Brandon: That is the best power of all time.
Amanda: Thank you Brandon!
Julia: I rolled an 18 but -1 so it's a 17.
Eric: Okay so 17 and Milo got a 16 but Aggie you got your 14. Yeah okay let's start with Aggie, and then you two I will give you details as you go through so you will not be surprised about what's happening. But Aggie you can ask one question while you're still in front of Dr. Morrow in the flashback.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah where's the best place to enter this maze?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Great question, we have a run on a tree. Aggie have you noticed any strange-looking trees? Like you know when they take cell phone towers and they put branches on them to make it seem like it's a tree?
Amanda (as Aggie): Sure it's on it's on I-90, yeah.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah, yeah you know the one um have you seen anything like this around?
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean there's the tree that's definitely dead and no one's chopped down there's that one.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah start with that.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay it's right outside the library so let's uh let's meet there tomorrow night?
Julia (as Val): Sure.
Brandon (as Milo): [Hesitantly] I've never been to the library can you give me directions how?
Julia (as Val): You are the nerdiest person I have ever met in my entire life. How have you never been to a library?!
Brandon (as Milo): I'm a fandom nerd! Not like—
Eric: I thought Brandon meant that specific library, I'm like “okay well he goes to the Industry City one obviously”
Amanda (as Aggie): Do you know where Ma's is? It's like four doors down.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay cool, thank you.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay—
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh no they took down the sign of Ma’s so he might not recognize that…
Brandon (as Milo): I know where I know where Ma’s is.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay it looks different now it just kind of looks like a building. Just want to make everybody aware!
Eric: Alright so before we hop back to the present, is there anything that you explicitly want to do immediately after leaving Dr. Morrows before you all go home go to sleep or whatever?
Brandon: Hmm, I would like to try to find out more about Dr. Morrow in terms of how trustworthy they are, and if they're legit.
Eric: That's a good question, so I'm giving all of you a flashback for you to use during this mission. So whenever there is an opportunity like you wanted to prepare something or you wish that you had done something during the day before this mission, I'll give you the opportunity to like do one skills check, set up a situation, and you have to use like a certain expend a certain amount of your HP depending on how involved it is or not. We're pulling this from Blades in the Dark, game nerds out there.
Amanda: It's like “oh no Brad Pitt's trapped in the casino! How ever will he get out? Oh wait, earlier today George Clooney paid off a guy.”
Eric: Exactly so that's how you do it like a heist, but this could be like oh I bought this thing, or oh I talked to this guy, or I intimidated this person. Something you would do the day before. So Brandon, for this specific thing, if you are in a situation where you need to know this, you can set up you talking to the spirit who you met in the museum. But now as you're leaving if you just like want to talk to someone or I'll just let you do an insight check
Brandon: Yeah it totally makes sense, and I think I will save the big one for later if I need it. But I think on the way out yeah I'll talk to January and ask them like
Brandon (as Milo): Hey January do you like your job? :ike are you treated well? Is this a good place—is this a good workplace do I need to call OSHA?
Eric: [Laughing] Alright roll an inside check.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: AHH! That one went off my table...
Julia: Go get it.
Brandon: Weeell!
Amanda: Oh no.
Julia: That's not good.
Brandon: I do have a +5 to insight and that still gives me a 9.
Julia: Oh buddy.
Eric: Okay so remember insight is just how well you are seeing into their soul, like you have to just believe what they tell you or not you know whatever you know whatI'm saying so with a 9, I think January would say:
Eric (as January): Yeah! I love Dr. Morrow! I don't know who else would hire a rabbit, and then bring them to consciousness, and then treat them like they were a partner, and a peer uh you know I don't it's hard you know– it's strange but you know my people, we're really endangered in this area, especially just the way the climate change goes you know? My fur doesn't change if it is snowy, or not snowy and I'm still brown or white you know they could really get attacked by predators, and Dr. Morrow brought me in gave me a purpose.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah.
Eric (as January): She's great! I know you think she's great too!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I'm a huge fan I mean I got that t-shirt from her tour in ‘89 handed down to me.
Eric (as January): Oh yeah that's vintage that's when she did like an old style like World's Fair road show, and showed off all of her stuff. It was called the World's Fair Too: But This Time I'm Doing It by Dr. Morrow.
[Everyone laughing]
Brandon: Yeah it was— I heard it was wild. I wish I could have been old enough to see it for myself, but um that's great to hear, yeah! I'm glad that you know, that you like living here.
Eric (as January): Hey, I'm glad. I know that she can be pushy sometimes and it's just really cerebral, but I'm glad that you're doing what you can to make the world better.
Brandon (as Milo): Thanks, I—
Eric: And he like hops over to you and like nuzzles you a little bit—
[Amanda and Julia gasp and awww]
Brandon: How soft is January?
Eric: Pretty freaking soft. But I will say it's like fur is soft, but also that's a good suit!
Brandon: Yeah, yeah it's like supple, it's really supple fabric.
Brandon: Yes an italian wool?
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Only the best. I also like the implication of what you just said there is Dr. Morrow hired a rabbit, and then awoke it.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: She's like “you know what I need? I need someone to help around the house, let me just get this rabbit. Oh the rabbit kind of needs a little bit of intelligence, huh? Alright well it's awakened now, and now I have a man servant a he’s a bunny servant!”
Eric: She was choosing the rabbit first, and then she like “I'm going to awaken this thing but first need to pick the rabbit I'm going to do.”
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: There's like a year of cutscenes where she's just like January get me tea, and it's just a cuts to a rabbit.
Eric: Okay so now we're back to the present and the three of you are standing around this dead tree and Aggie you notice that there's one branch on the dead tree that looks still alive.
Amanda (as Aggie): So do we think we should pull this branch?
Julia: Val's already pulling it.
Amanda (as Aggie): Great!
Eric: Alright so you pull the branch, and from the middle of the trunk is a keypad, and it says “password” and there are five digits it's like a 1980s laptop just like folds out of the trunk and it says “password” and then the five digits, the green on green screen.
Julia (as Val): The likelihood of it being ice cream is very low right?
Brandon (as Milo): Probably.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): It would only be ice cr, but I thought of that too.
Julia (as Val): But like I was saying you know if you take out the e's and the a's and the whatnot, then you could probably spell ice cream right?
Brandon (as Milo): Is it like a flavor of ice cream do you think?
Julia (as Val): No mint mint needs another one…
Amanda: Aggie counts on her fingers a lot of flavors.
Brandon (as Milo): We are also dealing with like teenage boys, so it could be 4 20 69, who knows?
Julia (as Val): It could just be penis, you are correct.
Amanda (as Aggie): It could just be boobs.
[Eric bursts out laughing]
Julia (as Val): [Nonchalantly] Can we try penis? How do we feel about using penis?
Amanda (as Aggie): I feel like boobs first is a better bet yeah I let's uh let's try it.
Julia: Do we have an indication that if we put the wrong password and some alarm is going to go off somewhere?
Amanda: Yeah can I investigate the keypad to see if any of the letters are more worn than others?
Eric: That's very good, do an investigation check.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 16.
Eric: The eights and the zeros are very worn.
Julia (as Val): It's boobs! You got it right! I can't believe it, good job guys!
Amanda: I type in eight zero zero eight five.
Brandon: That was the most pain I've ever seen you in, Eric.
Amanda: Eric looks like he had a really bad meal.
Eric: It's not— it's not even that, it's just like here's a little peek behind the screen here, sometimes you make puzzles and you see what your players do, and then you say like oh that's such a good idea, I really like that! So you guys were suggesting I had like ice cream ideas and I had really sweet things for Ma's but Brandon made a very good point that they're idiot boys. So I rolled to see if it was going to be a lewd password or a not lewd password and I rolled an 8. And then I rolled against Amanda's intelligence checks to see if they could disguise the fact that they were putting that in, and I rolled a 4. So I'm just like yes it boobs.
Julia: There we go! I love the background, thank you for that.
Eric: Like you knew originally it was like Ma's or something, and then someone reprogrammed it because they couldn't remember it and it became boobs.
Amanda: Like w-f-f-l-e.
Eric: Yeah I couldn't wait to the afterparty. I had to tell you that.
Amanda: Alright so I type it in.
Eric: Yeah! [Laughing]
Brandon: Classic Yabby move!
Julia: Yabby.
Brandon: Really Jimmed it up.
Amanda and Julia: [In sync] Really Jimmed it up!
Eric: He really jimmed it up. He was a real Jim jam, like I assume this is all just in character. I find that very funny. But as you're talking about that yeah the trunk of this dead tree just kind of descends into the ground, and then it goes [noises that allude to stairs appearing] as stairs just like pop out of the spiral that the platform lowering down has created.
Amanda: So we're basically stepping into a tree trunk that contains now a spiral staircase.
Eric: Yes.
Julia: Extremely cool.
Amanda: I've always wanted to do this.
Brandon (as Milo): What do you think the likelihood of Keebler Elves in here is?
Julia (as Val): I would say very low it okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay, so we definitely have to do the crime thing then?
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): If anyone's hungry we should deal with that now.
Julia (as Val): Did everyone not eat a full trail lasagna before they came here? Or was that just me?
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): I really need to get on your like meal your dinner distribution.
Julia (as Val): Listen I burn a lot of calories you know vibrating and stuff, and sometimes you just need to eat you have to you have to carb up.
Amanda (as Aggie): No Ii'm jealous, that sounds great!
Eric: Val seems like the kind of person who like forgets to eat, and they’re just like “oh I haven't eaten in 26 hours!” and then eats an entire lasagna.
Julia: Yeah!
[Amanda and Eric laughing]
Eric: Amazing.
Brandon: Eric as we go down the stairs, can I roll a stealth check to see if either of the other two see me put on my batman mask?
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Yeah, roll a stealth check.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Can I roll perception, I guess?
Brandon: I did get a 17.
Julia: Oh I'm gonna roll perception, I have a 0 to perception, so this will be fun.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: I did get a natural 20 though!
[Everyone cheers]
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: So—
Eric: [Laughing] Oh my god.
Brandon: You like know the make and model of this mask, and where I got it from like—
Julia (as Val): The fucking George Clooney mask, are you serious? Get out of here with that shit! We're heisting!
Brandon (as Milo): I thought we might— I didn't want to be on the internet again, you understand.
Julia (as Val): Oh oh oh, so if there's pictures they're just gonna be like “look at this ghost batman who came and broke into a tree underground!”
[Eric laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): That's a good point…
Julia (as Val): You're already gonna already be on the internet, my bud.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah…
Brandon: And Milo slides the mask off.
Julia: There we go. Thank you. We’ll get cooler masks eventually, if we do this job well.
Amanda (as Aggie): So—
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t think there's any cooler masks than Batman’s but whatever.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): So I have a flashlight I can go first, and if we see any danger coming just I don't know make a make a low noise. Because I feel like element of surprise is the important thing for us here.
Julia: Can I do a flashback?
Eric: Yeah Julia what would Val like to do during the day I would like to contact River Greens.
Amanda: Ooooh!
Eric: Amazing okay, how would you like to contact him?
Julia: I have his phone number I think, I took his student ID that's what I did.
Amanda: Oh yeah, that’s right.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: I'm gonna just show up to his dorm then.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Okay yes if you want to show up to his dorm, you will have to give up 20 percent of your HP.
Julia: Yeah it's fine, I could do that.
Eric: Alright cool how many uh HP is that for you?
Julia: So I have 32.
Eric: Yeah so just give up 7.
Julia: Okay cool so that means I'm down to 25.
Eric: Wonderful, okay‚—
Amanda: Still more than me.
Brandon: Yeah still more than me!
Eric: So yeah you go to SUNY LTC and I feel like you you're at his dorm, you're rapping on his door.
Julia: Just pounding on it,.
Eric (as River Greens): [Muffled] Oh, oh shit! Hold up, cop, cop, cop!
Eric: And there's like a bunch of rummaging, and there's just like the smell of kush is really just coming through.
Julia (as Val): Listen you gotta share if you got weed in there.
Eric (as River Greens): [Hesitantly] N-no?
Julia (as Val): Yes, open the door open. Open the door.
Eric (as River Greens): Oh who is it?
Julia (as Val): Open the door.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric (as River Greens): Okay…
Eric: You see River Greens opens the door, he's wearing like a bucket hat right now, and a Dave Matthews t-shirt yeah that’s tie-dyed.
Amanda: Yes!
Eric: It's from the Crash Into Me tour.
Amanda: Wait can we can we do a little round robin here as to the posters on the wall?
Eric: Oh yeah absolutely Amanda you go first.
Amanda: It's definitely the pink soap fight club poster.
Eric: Perfect.
Julia: Ahh you took mine. Uhh Bob Marley.
Brandon: I mean there's gotta be that Godfather or Scarface poster in every college store.
Eric: There's that poster that's always that one of those two women kissing?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Do you know what I'm talking about?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: There's one really specific one that's yeah
Julia: It's in like black and white, I know.
Eric: Yeah, a hundred percent. Thank you, yeah River Greens has opened the door and behind him is the two other college students who were with him in the woods, and they both just— everyone just freezes.
Julia: Val just looks like
Julia (as Val): Are you two useful?
[Amanda laughs]
Julia (as Val): Are you two useful?
Eric: One of them puts a bong down, and the other one is holding their breath perceptively.
Julia (as Val): That is not an answer to my question, you can exhale the smoke now.
[Eric exhales loudly into the mic]
[Brandon laughing]
Eric (as college student): No!
Julia (as Val): You're not useful?
Eric (as college student): Noo…
Julia (as Val): Okay you can leave then, goodbye.
Eric (as college student): Okay, bye River!
Eric: Two of them run out.
[Brandon and Amanda laughing]
Amanda: Incredible.
Eric (as River Greens): Oh yeah hey, um person from the woods. What's up?
Julia (as Val): Alright, you seem like a nerd, you seem like you have some technological understanding of things.
Eric (as River Greens): Oh yeah? I guess so, yeah.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Amanda: [Mockingly as River] I did make a bong from an apple once.
Julia (as Val): That is not the kind of quality of work I'm looking for, not the craftsmanship I am looking for but I appreciate it nonetheless.
Brandon: I didn't hear that clearly I definitely thought you said “I bought my bong from Apple”
[Amanda and Julia laughing]
Julia (as Val): I need to know if there are people in a certain vicinity of me, sometime in the near future, and because you know everyone's got a cell phone nowadays, and everyone always has it on their person, I think you're the kind of person who could you know be able to tell if there are other cell phones in the immediate area, you understand what I'm saying?
Eric: Oh interesting alright so Val, what do you want?
Julia: Val wants to create like like be able to track phones within the vicinity so they know if they're coming upon a person underground.
Eric: Wonderful okay that's interesting, this is a tall order for a college student. Make a I wish there was like a technology role.
Julia: We can do arcana?
Eric: Yeah I was gonna say do an arcana roll, with the DC 15 you'll get something that helps you with the DC 20 you'll get the thing you're looking for.
Julia: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: I got an 18.
Amanda: Oooh!
Julia: Damn that’s close.
Eric: With an 18, he’ll be like
Eric (as River Greens): You know, I'm not that smart, but I have something that might be able to help you out.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric: And he takes out walkie-talkies. They look like they're modified from— it's like someone got them surplus from a construction site, but then like spray painted them like party colors, and it's just like “Party Talky!” on it.
Julia: Oh boy…
Brandon: What do you use that for?!
Julia (as Val): Do I want to know what you have been using these for?
Eric (as River Greens): It's to talk to each other in loud parties, if you're separated then you can all meet up and do sick things together.
Julia (as Val): Oh okay because you know people sometimes get social anxiety at parties because it gets too loud and overstimulating, got it, alright, let's do it!
Eric (as River Greens): Um well the thing is, is that if you're not on the right channel, you can hear other people's conversations.
Eric: So he switches the channel, and it's picking up like the campus security and they're like
Eric (as Campus Security): [Over the radio] Yeah, I got them, they're running down to the dining hall. I can catch them there.
Amanda: [Laughing] What's happening?
Eric (as Campus Security): They all smell like super duper smell like weed, I got them.
Julia: Val's gonna take them out of his hands, and be like
Julia (as Val): Thank you for your service, I will return them in a fortnight.
Eric (as River Greens): No it's fine you could just keep them, just don’t come back.
Julia (as Val): Okay, I can't promise I won't come back though. You gotta fucking behave yourself.
Eric (as River Greens): No please don't come back.
Brandon: Was that Val trying to connect with the kids by saying fortnight?
Julia: No.
Brandon: Okay.
Julia: Not even a little bit.
Eric: Amazing, alright so Val, you have these walkie-talkies I would say that he gave you two.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So they are just regular walkie-talkies, and also I'll let you do another arcana check for you to pick up like the radio frequencies that they might be using.
Julia: I'm gonna give it to someone else who might have a higher intelligence than me then.
Brandon: I have plus three to arcana.
Julia: Oh hell yeah I'm gonna hand one of them to Milo, and explain what they do as much as I can.
Brandon (as Milo): Why is it painted and say Party Talky on it?
Julia (as Val): Because it's for parties did you not go to college? I think you probably get to college?
Brandon (as Milo): I did! I—I didn’t go out much— uhh…
Julia (as Val): Okay!
[Transition note]
Amanda: Hey it's Amanda, I feel like you're either the kind of person who when you find an item of clothing that works for you buys it in every color or you're a person who has yet to hear the wisdom that when you find an item of clothing you really like you should definitely buy it in every color, this midroll is brought to you by t-shirt dresses.

And now, let’s get back to the show!
Eric: For both Val and Milo you know where you are. So this is like this entrance hallway and there's like a main hallway that leads to the rest of the underground area, and there are a few different just general larger rooms branching off from there.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: It's more of a bunker than it is like a hideout there's not like a garage in one area, it's just like there's one big room, and there's another big room and there's one end secret entrance from the tree.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh man this is just like GoldenEye.
Julia (as Val): That— that's a James Bond movie... yes?
Brandon (as Milo): Well yeah, I meant the video game, but yeah.
Julia (as Val): Okay.
Eric: So yeah you need to go down one hallway, and then there you take a left, and then it kind of branches off into two larger rooms.
Julia: Alright do we want to use the walkie-talkies real quick just to check to see who's around?
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Okay cool.
Eric: Both of you make arcana checks.
Julia: I rolled a 14 -1 so it's a 13.
Eric: Okay cool.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: I rolled a 13 +3 for 16.
Julia: Hell yeah I'm glad I gave it to you.
Eric: Ooo, hell yeah. Okay yeah so Val you're switching around on all the channels, and you can't really hear anything. Bu Milo you are switching around, and you hear one channel you get to the the back end of a conversation, and you hear what a guy go
Eric (as Goon 1): [Over the walkie-talkie] I don't know why do we still need to stand here? Over.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Goon 2): [Over the walkie-talkie] You don't have to—you don't have to say “over” every time, it's a walkie-talkie I know that. Yes you do just stand there, it's you— we're on high alert so you three stand in the hallway, I'm gonna be back, I'm gonna be in the back.
Brandon: Okay I relay all that information to my teammates.
Julia (as Val): Well there's a back part, that is good to know.
Amanda (as Aggie): and if we don't see anybody in this hallway, there must be another hallway.
Julia (as Val): Hmmm okay.
Amanda: When we were looking at the plans, did we get a sense of how extensive this is? Does it seem like it's just the two rooms in one hall, or did we see more evidence of a bigger footprint?
Eric: So there's there's like an L shape which is the entrance coming down, and there's a hallway and then you take a left and there's another hallway, and then there are theoretically two rooms on the end there.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): I guess let's head toward the back then.
Eric: Okay you guys poke around the corner, and you see that there are three guys just standing there in various states of alert. It's like they've been standing there for a while, and they're like looking down their shoes, and like messing with each other and like pushing each other a little bit. So there's just three guys standing there.
Brandon: Is there like a door that we have to get through?
Eric: Make a perception check, everyone make a perception check.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Okay well I got a 7 so...
Amanda: 9.
Julia: Also a 9.
Eric: Yeah at the end of the hallway there is a—
Amanda: You know what can I use luck point?
Eric: Yeah use luck point!
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 12.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Yeah at the end of a hallway, at the end of this hallway it just takes a right so you cannot see where it leads.
Amanda (as Aggie): What if we put one of the walkie-talkies back by the entrance, and use the other one and turn it up really loud, and then use the other one to sound like we are someone at the entrance?
Julia (as Val): Oh like I like that.
Amanda (as Aggie): They’ll run past us we can try to get them as they pass.
Julia (as Val): Yeah, I like that or we don't even have to get them, if we can sneak past them, if Milo makes us all into shadow people like he did at the bank.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, yeah we can—
Amanda (as Aggie): Sorry Milo was that not you? Am I getting you confused with somebody else?
Julia (as Val): I'm sorry was that was that another shadow person with a panther?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah that’s a good point. I definitely can't do that…
Julia: Wink!
Brandon: And then uh Milo starts getting prepared to cast the spell okay.
[Julia laughing]
Eric: Cool so you want to cast pass without a trace first?
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: I think we see that first, yeah.
Eric: Okay cool, so yeah Milo you can cast pass without trace and please roll in your spirit surge.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Holy shit I got a 1.
Julia: Seriously?!
Amanda: Ayyy!
Eric: Oh my god.
Amanda: I mean it's bad, but also it's fun.
Julia: Well it could be good, we don't know!
Brandon: So pass without a trace will give you a +10 bonus to stealth checks, by the way.
Julia: Great.
Brandon: And uh we leave no tracks or other traces of our paths.
Amanda and Julia: Excellent.
Eric: [Laughing] Oh my god.
Julia: Oh god, I'm so nervous.
Eric: Please roll a d10.
Julia: Oh sweet baby jesus give us a good one.
Amanda: Big money.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 8.
[Eric chuckles]
Amanda: Oh no, Eric's laughing.
Julia: I don't like that. T
Amanda: I hate when he laughs.
[Amanda laughs nervously]
Eric: Alright! [he bursts out laughing]
Julia: Jesus.
Eric: [High pitched] Okay! [Laughing] So Milo you cast pass without trace you connect with the spirit realm, you put your two hands on Val—
Brandon: I get consent first.
Julia (as Val): Yes you may touch me, it is okay.
Eric: You put your hands on them, and all of and you look down and all of you just look like shadowy to you. It's like your opacity got turned down, and now you can pass without trace. And both of you, you start smelling smoke and where Milo is touching you is getting very hot.
Amanda: I step back.
Eric: Milo, you look down and everything on your body your all of your clothes are smoking, and you see that little embers are popping up around like a campfire is starting. Brandon for the next minute everything you're touching is just on fire—
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: And you see that like the hand that comes out of the portal in your chest, it makes the motion like it's turning on a zippo lighter it like flips it open and sparks it, and then you just go fwoom and everything you're touching is a flame.
Brandon (as Milo): Uuuuhhhh this has never happened before!
Julia (as Val): You are… on fire.
Amanda (as Aggie): New plan, just run toward the back.
Julia (as Val): You are on fire, and that is very intimidating slash distracting, so let's do that.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah run in circles tire them out!
Brandon (as Milo): They can't see me so I’m gonna stand here, and they're gonna think it's a fire, and you guys go.
Julia (as Val): How about you also light them on fire, just a great suggestion by me.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah yeah yeah! Just their clothes, there's a fire extinguisher outside, you'll be fine yeah!
Julia (as Val): It'll be fine! Stop, drop, and roll, it's all good!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah sure I'll do that…
Julia (as Val): You don't have to stop drop and roll, you are not in pain correct? Just to clarify?
Brandon (as Milo): No it's just weird.
Julia (as Val): Great! Let's make sure those guys catch on fire then.
Amanda: It's the appearance of fire but not actually burning them right?
Eric: Milo you're not getting hurt. However, those men would. These are actually on fire.
Brandon: Yeah. So I'm gonna gingerly walk towards a space where there's nothing flammable, and then I'm gonna place a walkie-talkie down and I'm saying
Brandon (as Milo): Alright someone yell “fire” in the walkie talkie, and then we'll go!
Julia: Val just goes “FIRE!” and then runs.
Eric: You look down at the walkie-talkie and it is now melted. So when Val says fire it's like
Eric (as Walkie Talkie): [Low volume and muffled] Ire!
Brandon (as Milo): That's enough right?
Julia (as Val): Yeah it's probably fine.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh let's just run!
Julia (as Val): Okay!
Amanda: What a good idea.
[Eric laughing]
Eric: Oh amazing, okay you hear one of the guys around the corner goes
Eric (as Goon): Hey do you go do you smell something?
Eric: And they’re like
Eric (as other Goon): Yeah! Oh there's fire!!!
Eric: And they run towards Milo, they’re like
Eric (as Goons): Oh it's a fire we have to go get oh what do we do why is there a fire down there?!
Eric: And they're just yelling, I need the two of you to make stealth checks.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: I got a nat 20.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Fuck that's a 26?
Julia: I got a 31 technically.
Eric: Amazing, so yeah they don't notice you two at all. Val and Aggie, they just run past you they're running and they're like
Eric (as Goons): Oh what what did you have me— tell us what we were supposed to do?! Do we stop drop and roll if we see fire was there fire?!
Brandon: And I'm gonna start doing like jumping jacks to make the fire seem like it's getting bigger.
Eric (as Goon): No it's growing!! It's growing!
Eric: Okay so I'm gonna roll, this is important Val and Aggie are down the hallway.
Amanda: I'm gonna yell over my shoulder trying to replicate the goon I fought earlier
Amanda (as Aggie trying to mimic Goon 2): [Higher pitched voice] Oh get out of here guys!
Eric: Oh make a charisma roll.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: No, guys!!
[Dice rolling]
Amadna: A 19, uhh plus…
Julia: No plus, minus.
Amanda: 18.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Alright 18 does it! So I need to roll about whether or not these guys follow directions enough that they're going to leave, but with an 18 I'm gonna make the dc 15. So they need to make charisma checks, and they all have 0 for charisma they need to roll above a 15 to stay with Milo. Because Milo I'm telling this to you as Brandon. Brandon this is only happening for a minute, and then eventually it's just going to be you.
Amanda: Yeah well that gives us what? Five turns? I think we can get it done.
Julia: Yeah!
[Dice rolling]
[Eric laughs]
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Or 10 turns because each turn is six seconds?
[Dice rolling]
Eric: Alright, yeah so I rolled a 4, an 11, and a natural 20.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: Ooooh, oh no.
Eric: So two of the guys book it, they're like
Eric (as Goons): Oh we're gonna go, we have to go get the water from outside! We're getting the water from the lake!
Eric: And they run out, they're looking for like a bucket and then one of the guys like
Eric (as Goon): I know! I can just smother it!
Julia: [Laughing] Oh no.
Brandon: I'm gonna do a flashback.
Eric: Okay.
[Eric and Julia laughing]
Brandon: So my flashback is gonna be a planning session between me and Tuna in the night before.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: So we're going to make plans for every possible contingency we can think of. Because the only two people in the world that we can count on is each other!
Amanda: And even Tuna's 50/50 on that one.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: So a couple of the moves we came up with is like Tuna sits behind someone's ankles and I push them over, and they trip. Or um—
Amanda: This is an adorable.
Brandon: |Yeah some other ones that I can't think of right now, but that's the one that Tuna is going to remember what to do. So I'm going to use my wow companion and call on Tuna.
Eric: Okay give me— first of all give me 10 percent of your HP. I think like trying to get Tuna to pay attention is enough for 10 percent of your HP.
Brandon: Yeah it's fair, it is 21, so we'll take 2 or 3 away, I guess?
Eric: That's pretty close, yeah. Just do 2, 2 HP.
Brandon: Okay, so the idea is that I don't have to tell Tuna what to do. I just call in Tuna and they assess the situation, and they like to go to plan F for fire or whatever.
Eric: Got it. Okay so now make an animal handling check to see if Tuna was paying attention.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Because this is in the flashback, like Tuna is like stalking around your room, and like you don't know if Tuna– like cats you don't know if they're actually listening to you, or not listening to you.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: I got 14 +5 for 19.
Eric: Nice! alright, so 19 Tuna’s like
Eric (as Tuna): Okay when would there be fire? That doesn't—
[Eric laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): I don't know Tuna but if there's a fire underground, we're all going to be screwed! So why don't you listen?
Eric (as Tuna): Mmmm the only fire I care about is the fire that warms up milk. Mrrow.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: But Tuna was paying attention, so where we flashback so now you do the do the wild shape, and uh this goon is about to smother you so I'm gonna do a grappling check they're gonna grapple against each other about whether or not Tuna can distract this guy.
Brandon: Great yeah, and I kind of want Tuna like try to push them over so they hit their head and like go unconscious.
Julia: Conk ‘em out.
Eric: Best case scenario yeah. Okay
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Tuna head butts him in the butt.
Eric: What's Tuna's dex?
Brandon: +2.
Eric: Okay so yeah you see Tuna poofs behind the guy, and he's trying to like sneak up on him and jumps on and goes RAAAR! and he goes AAHH! And he falls over all three of you are now just in a dog pile, pardon the joke. He is now trying to smother you like with his—
Brandon: Like with a fire blanket?
Eric: Yeah like a fire blanket, he's trying to put you out just with his whole body, also Tuna did push him into the fire so Milo you take three points of damage. But this goon takes five points of damage.
Julia: Nice
Eric: And Tuna is now distracting, he's now like confused. So let's go to Aggie and Val.
Julia: She's running.
Eric: You're running down so you take a right, and you're at the end of this hallway, and there are three rooms.
Julia: Are the doors open to any of these rooms?
Amanda: Yes is there light? Is there noise that we can sense?
Eric: Both of you make a perception check.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 17
Julia: 16
Eric: Okay in all three of them, it doesn't seem like anybody is in there. On the one on the left, which is like a storeroom that has lights on, you know that there is actually nobody in there.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: The other two, you're not sure if you just can't hear anything, or there isn't someone in there but you know that the guy on the on the walkie talkie is in one of these rooms. That's all I can give you from standing if you don't want to approach the two doors.
Amanda (as Aggie): Split them up?
Julia (as Val): One second do you— how do you feel about stealing stuff from bad people?
Amanda (as Aggie): Great, that's my favorite thing to do.
Julia (as Val): Awesome, let's go right their storage real quick because they had some cool goo guns and stuff before, and I think that would be fun.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah let's run in there.
Eric: Amazing okay this is a very nice looking storeroom, I don't know which of them is like a Marie Condo aficionado, or just really loves Ikea but like everything is on pegboards.
Amanda: Incredible, I want to live here.
Eric: There's like a lot of nefarious things there's like rope, and like the shields, and some of the stuff that you saw from like the bank robbery. Is there something specific that you two are looking for?
Julia: I feel like one of those shields would be kind of cool we could use it as like a battering ram style that could be fun.
Amanda: Yeah and I think any kind of detection equipment, night vision goggles, sonar like sensory radar type thing.
Eric: Okay both of you make investigation checks.
Amanda: Like thermal imaging.
Eric: Yeah.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: I got a 15!
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: A non-natural 20.
Julia: Nice!
Eric: Wonderful! Okay Val, you see that they also have some of those ray guns that you saw from the bank robbery, and Aggie as you are looking around and I don't think that they would have like thermal detection, or like night vision because they're kind of just like goons. Like they're not that sophisticated, they only need the things they need. But you do see that like there's a lot of scientific stuff in here, like weapons like you're looking at you see that there's the ray gun that Val was talking about, and they have the shield, and there was that jet pack, and you don't really understand and then you see on the shield on the inside there's instructions. It seems like it's just like a rod iron shield that you're supposed to just hold it up. But then you look at the instructions, and it's like “To the idiots: one: hold up the shield. Two: don't get hurt, duh” and then below it where there would be like a name it's like there are three lines that look like a river.
Julia (as Val): It's fucking River, I know it! River Greens.
Amanda: I'll grab the shield.
Eric: If you hold the shield you get +2 to your AC!
Amanda: Alright!
Eric: The instructions, there's like a thing below it that says “if you don't want to carry the shield: One: jam it in the ground. Two: don't get hurt.” So you can like jam it into the ground, and use it as cover, which gives people a disadvantage on attacks against you if you jam it on the ground. It's surprisingly lightweight for something that's supposed to be like rot iron type.
Julia: Can I have one of those sick ray guns then? Eric, please?
Eric: Yeah you can grab a ray gun!
Julia: I would like a ray gun.
Eric: Yeah it's surprisingly heavy, but there's another set of instructions that it says “one: pull trigger. Two poof.”
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Is this the same kind of ray gun that was in the briefcase that I carried to the First National?
Eric: Oh that's a good question because I did talk about the weight. Roll an investigation check.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Okay it's a 16 -1 for 15.
Eric: The weight seems similar.
Julia: Okay interesting.
Julia (as Val): I’m gonna hold onto this.
Eric: You can't say for sure, but you've felt this before. Alright let's go back to the man on fire, and Milo so the man is on fire—
Amanda: Can I do a quick flash back?
Eric: Oh Aggie, do a flashback.
Amanda: So I would like to flash back to that morning. Aggie got up a little bit earlier than usual and got double her usual order at Mountain News—
Brandon: Two newspapers!
Amanda: And went over to— exactly! And went over to the police station and she walks in to see Brian Roper on duty and sort of was like
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh hey like you got five minutes? Come outside, they gave me double coffee so I thought I’d bring one over for you.
Eric: He mimes adjusting his suspenders with his thumbs as he stands something like
Eric (as Brian Roper): [With a gruff voice] Uh Aggie!
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen, Brian I am going to be doing an inspection tonight, and I might flush out accidentally some ne’er do wells so I don't know if you would find it appropriate to park outside the library, I don't know about 11-10? And you see some kids running at you, well just ask them one question and I think they'll admit to some criminal activity pretty quickly.
Eric: Amazing, roll charisma with advantage.
Julia: Dumb teens.
Eric: You can do uh persuasion as well.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Ugh, it's only 11.
Eric: Okay with 11. Yeah Officer Roper takes the coffee, and the bagel and the Aggie blotter from you he looks at it and is like
Eric (as Brian Roper): You know Aggie this seems a lot more like your beat, you're picking up uh just ne'er do wells running around, I see— I read the Aggie blotter every week—
Amanda (as Aggie): You don't want easy callers that's that's on you. I'm just I'm just giving you a heads up man.
Eric (as Brian Roper): Alright uh what time?
Amanda (as Aggie): Alright, let's say 11:05.
Eric (as Brian Roper): [Smacks his lips] Huh okay.
Eric: Alright so Milo you're dealing with this guy just on top of you, and Tuna is on top, you're like struggling.
Brandon: A Tuna sandwich you might say.
Julia: Jesus.
[Amanda groans]
Brandon: Yeah! Thank you, thank you!
Eric: You hear “Freeze! LTCPD!” And then you hear “oof” as someone shoulder checks the guy off of you.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: And you see there's this cop—
Amanda: Brian! This is not what we talked about!
Eric: This cop just standing over you like
Eric (as Brian Roper): What-what is happening?
Eric: And Milo you look down, and you are naked except for uh your underwear.
[Brandon laughing]
Brandon: Am I visible though? I still have pass without trace on.
Eric: Oh that's right! Roll stealth!
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Well I got a 17 +2 is 19, +10 is 29.
[Everyone cheering]
Eric: Oh wow, he's just like staring down at you and—
Brandon: I freeze because I don't know if he can see me or not.
Eric: This cop is like
Eric (as Brian): I—was there a cat here? He's like looking around and Milo, he does not see you but Milo, you are nearly naked that is confirmed.
Amanda: I bet there's some clothes in the store room!
Brandon: And cold. I'm a little chilly.
Eric: Officer Roper is dealing with the goon who is on top of you, so yeah you can uh you can do whatever you want.
Brandon: Yeah I mean I'm gonna slip back past them, and and go back to join my friends.
Eric: Yeah so you see the two—
Brandon: Sans clothes.
Eric: Yeah you run over there and then Milo is standing there just in his underwear.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think I saw a jumpsuit in there.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Julia (as Val): What is your underwear made out of that it was the only thing that didn't burn off your body?
Brandon (as Milo): It's—it's uh… Batman inspired underwear, it's bulletproof… it's flame proof.
Julia (as Val): Jesus, my man, my dude.
Eric: [Laughing] Kevlar underwear!
Amanda: That's very cool.
Brandon (as Milo): It’s kevlar underwear.
Eric: Amazing, okay yeah there is a jumpsuit in the storeroom if you want to pop that on.
Brandon: Yeah I immediately quickly and shamefully put the jumpsuit on.
Eric: Amazing.
Brandon: What’s it look like?
Eric: It's just like a mechanic's jumpsuit. You can see that like there's some rudimentary costumes in here, but it's just like sweatshirts with big hoods, and like and this is a mechanics outfit that just says Steve's on it.
Brandon: Gotcha.
Julia (as Val): Alright so uh the other two doors?
Amanda (as Aggie): We can just kick them down?
Julia (as Val) We can just open them up and see what happens. Alright cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah so I'll take the far right one, Val you wanna take the middle one?
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay and we'll kick it down on three.
Eric: Yeah alright, both of you make an attack roll against these doors.
Julia: Sure I'd like to go into a rage before I enter if that's cool.
Eric: Smart.
Julia: Cool.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Uh I got a three so I'm going to reroll with a luck point.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Why amIrolling so many nat 20s?! What is happening?
Amanda: Dang!
Eric: Damn!
Amanda: I got a 19.
Eric: Alright Val, you kick open the middle door, and it just like poofs it's like you're in a karate movie, it just like opens up and then you hear “OOOH” and a body crumpling the floor, and you look around and it's Yabby from the bank heist. Yeah he's like
Eric (as Yabby): Oh what why would you do this to me?
Amanda (as Aggie): Eat dirt, Yabby.
Julia: So dumb.
Brandon: Don't make sexist passwords.
Eric (as Yabby): I didn’t— how did you know I put boobs?
Julia (as Val): Who else would it have been?
Eric (as Yabby): Any of us! We all thought it— was we all thought it was funny!
Julia: Can I just put him immediately into like a sleeper hold or something?
Eric: Yeah grapple them.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: We'll just do a grapple check.
Julia: It's just a strength check right?
Eric: Yeah and I can use dex cool.
Julia: And I get an advantage on that.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Jesus what is happening?!
Brandon: Did you get another nat 20?
Julia: YES!
Amanda: Dang!
Eric: I rolled a natural 1. You immediately just get him in a hold. I don't know— describe what this looks like to me!
Julia: It's just like I got him up in a like a full nelson, like my arms are under his armpits, and then holding him around the neck.
Amanda: With a Val backpack, how adorable.
Eric: Yeah and Val you can just easily carry them around if you'd like.
Julia: Yeah that's fine.
Eric: Okay I think immediately, he's just like
Eric (as Yabby): Don't! Don't I'll give you whatever you want! Just don't go in there!
Julia (as Val): Oh well we're going in there guys!
Eric (as Yabby): No I told you not to! Please don't go in there, please I told you not to please!
Julia (as Val): Yeah he gave us the perfect place to go, so we're going in there!
[Brandon laughing]
Eric (as Yabby): Please don't!
Amanda: Was there anything in my room?
Eric: Yeah with a 19 you kick open the door, so yeah the the rest of the hideout down there seems to be like it was dug out, there is like rudimentary trying to put like an underground base together. But this is really like it seems new, it's shining it's like chrome everywhere, and it's freezing in there. It's like someone built a walk-in freezer just attached to the rest of the this underground bunker. And Yabby is like thrashing against Val like
Eric (as Yabby): Don't—don't go in there! Please don't go in there!
Eric: When you walk into an underground freezer you would think you would see like hanging stakes, like meat like in a Rocky movie but there's only one thing in here. At the far side of the room in a large cylindrical— I guess container is the only way to describe it, with her hands pressed up against the glass, and peacefully laying there is what looks to be a 65 year old woman, with gray hair tied up in a bandana, and Aggie his is Ma of Ma's Ice Cream shop.
[Everyone gasps]
Amanda: No!
Eric (as Yabby): No don't! It looks a lot worse, we're trying to help her it looks a lot worse than you think it looks like!
Brandon (as Milo): It looks real bad!
Amanda (as Aggie): Is she sick what are you doing?!
Eric (as Yabby): Of course she's sick! We don't know what to! Oh yes she's sick!
Amanda (as Aggie): You didn't think to go to the foremost scientist in the world with this problem?
Eric (as Yabby): Yeah because Dr. Morrow's gonna listen to the Nephews, just like it's always been!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah she would!
Eric (as Yabby): No she wouldn't! I know that she wouldn't!
Amanda (as Aggie): You wanna bet?
Eric (as Yabby): Yes! No don't—no don't contact no!
Eric: You see that he like he's he realizes that he's yelling and he like catches himself, and you look over to the cylindrical container, and Ma's eyes open.
Julia: Creepy!
Eric: And she says
Eric (as Ma): What? I how—I didn't mean just I didn't mean to sleep this long, I thought I was just I was just trying to nap. What's—what's happening? Is this… Did I get stuck in the— in the walk-in freezer again?
Amanda (as Aggie): Ma'am, I believe your nephews were trying to help you, and preserve your life. Would you like us to seek medical attention for you?
Eric (as Ma): Aggie! Aggie, it's so good to see you I haven't— you've grown, you're— you're so I don't know, you look good you look so good!
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean, I miss your chocolate chip cookie dough.
Eric (as Ma): Yeah I meant yeah we haven't I even got a chance to really get my hands into the bakery in a while, can you tell your friend to put him down? Please?
Julia (as Val): No.
Eric (as Ma): Yabby just he doesn't— he talks he even I know, I think he just talks too much.
Amanda (as Aggie): Ma, I believe that they've kept you here against your will. We're here to rescue you and I want to ask you before I do something rash. But we are working with Dr. Morrow on some revitalization projects, and I think she could help.
Eric (as Ma): Ahhh, that stuck-up asshole.
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean if it's a stuck-up asshole who will save your life then you know?
Eric (as Ma): The boys were just trying to help, I know that they were. It's fine, it's it looks bad but, it's really fine. Can you let him go?
Julia (as Val): First off, apologies ma'am, but no. Because he is very loud and I'm worried he's going to run off, and make things worse.
Eric (as Ma): Yabby will you stay where you are?
Eric: And Yabby just very like he's just looking down at his shoes, and he's just like
Eric (as Yabby): Yeah, yeah Ma, I will.
Eric (as Ma): See he said he was gonna stay.
Julia: Val just whispers in his ear
Julia (as Val): I will destroy you if you do anything bad,
Eric (as Yabby): I’m not—
Julia (as Val): I will destroy you. Okay great I'm letting you go now.
Eric: I like the idea that like you're not that much taller than him would you have like six inches off the ground.
Julia: I'm probably shorter than him to be honest.
Eric: Yeah definitely, and he just like he lands on the ground, and then goes like stands over in the corner.
Julia: and Val continues like
Julia (as Val): Ma'am I don't want to speak out of turn or anything, but I also know that selling ice cream cannot usually afford this level of technology that's hanging out in here.
Eric (as Ma): This isn't— it's not ice cream money I can tell you.
Julia (as Val): Yes, I can see that, I know how much money an ice cream person makes. Where did all of this come from?
Eric (as Ma): I have a question for you, if you’ll indulge an old woman who's seen a lot. This is honestly wonderful, I love this. What are you three doing here?
Julia (as Val): Usually I don't prefer for my questions to be answered with a question.
Eric (as Ma): Fair, but alsoI'm the woman in an ice tray so I think maybe you'll afford me the kindness.
Julia (as Val): I'm not about to afford kindness to people who have you know, in the past tried to run me over with ice cream trucks, or um—
Brandon (as Milo): Rob a bank.
Julia (as Val): Rob banks while I was there trying to buy a chair. In general not feeling super generous right now to kind of sum it up for youI'm sure you're a very nice lady ma'am and I respect that, and I respect your age, and what you you know bring to our community but I would like answers.
Eric (as Ma): Well, that's fair. You seem like we would make a great pair, you and I. Ice cream and pizza.
Julia (as Val): Concerning that– okay.
Eric (as Ma): I just got— I got the are you not of an Italian descent?
Julia (as Val): So that means I have to make pizza? Okay.
Eric (as Ma): I have family from Sicily right from the time they were from Sicily.
Amanda: Tip of the boot.
Eric (as Ma): They’re right on the tip of the boot. Obviously my boys can't afford this. They've done their best, quite a lot, but they had help that's true.
Eric (as Yabby): Ma! Don’t tell ‘em! Don’t tell ‘em!
Julia (as Val): What did I say about you speaking again huh?
Eric: Yeah he looks directly down at the floor.
Eric (as Ma): Okay I know the jig is up Yabby. Most of you are in jail, it's–they're here for a reason. My boys got help from the only ones who would help them out.
[Ominous sci-fi music fades in]
Eric (as Ma): When you're down, when no one else will help you, the tide [voice distorts gradually] regardless rushes in, the water flows down from upstate from upland, and down, and the people's river [voice sounds entirely robotic] is here to wash everything away.
Eric: Val make a dexterity check for me.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Oh yeah well there there's the opposite spectrum of the rolls I've been rolling. That's a 1.
Eric: Oh Val thank you! You feel a Yabby move like move out of your range, and he like slaps something on the wall, and he takes his hand away, and there's a blue button with the case pulled up, and it goes “WAAH WAH WAH!” A voice comes over just like a PA system and it says “Ma escape plan activated” and there's a [whirring sound] as the the cylindrical container it hydraulics up, and then you see that from the ground the cylindrical container had metal legs attached.
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric: And two compartments like bust out of the cylindrical body, and there are two arms.
Brandon: Oh my god.
Julia: God damn it.
Eric: And like they power up, [hydraulics whirring] and then there's a countdown that says
Eric (as Countdown): Five, four, three,
Eric: And the mech that Ma is in turns towards the wall of the freezer she turns around and waves to you three and says
Eric (as Ma): [Robotic voice] I'm sure we'll talk again soon, don't be too hard on the boys.
Eric (as Countdown): Three, two.
Eric: And then Officer Brian Roper just runs into the room he says
Eric (as Brian Roper): [Frazzled] Lake Town— Lake Town City PD— what?! What is that?!
Eric (as Countdown): ONE.
Eric: And the mech just busts through the ceiling like Super Mario just like leading with the fist, and it jumps through the ceiling of the walk-in freezer. There's just like a big hole leading up into the beautiful October night sky.
Julia (as Val): Why does ice cream keep fucking me what the hell!?
[Ominous music fades out]

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to a triple-strength Afterparty! It's not just afterparty for episode 7 and 8, but also for Issue #1 of SLaM.
Julia: Salaam!
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: JTP XXX!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Hold on.
[A beat passes]
Eric: Brandon explain that.
Brandon: So you know like with cartoons where they have like a alcohol bottle that has like three X's on it cause it's triple strength?
Julia: Well that's a much lighter joke.
Brandon: Yeah, it’s nothing nasty—
Amanda: I was going more a “girls girls girls” direction.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: I'm—I'm recording this completely nude, you're just gonna have to trust me.
Julia: Oh god we have to turn the cameras off.
Eric: Oh turn them back on! I thought that was the point!
Amanda: Why don't we move to a giant rabbit, or a small rabbit? Let's talk about January please!
Eric: A regular-sized rabbit!
Amanda: So smol!
Eric: The snowshoe hare is only fifty centimeters long, so he is only that tall. So he's like a foot and a half, two feet tall. He's just very adorable.
Julia: Adorable!
Brandon: That's still tall enough to like reach doorknobs and stuff right?
Eric: Oh yeah, I mean he can jump as well he's been doing this for a while so he definitely knows how to use his little rabbit paws. His little beans to open doors and stuff yeah of course.
Julia: So cute.
Brandon: Little rabbit beans!
Amanda: So sweet.
Eric: I still remember the first time that I unveiled this to you, and I'm so glad that this happened on microphone because something that I wish happened more was you guys reacting to the wild shit that happens here. Even when I revealed Chad back in campaign one you're like “okay so so what do we do next? How do we get out of the mansion?” and I'm like there is an Ooze talking to you guys!! So I very much appreciate that you're all like “Ex-squeeze me?!”
Julia: Pardon?
Brandon: You've learned that we react best to cute things as opposed to giant oozes, and so now you know how—
Eric: Are you saying that Chad is not cute?
Amanda: I mean I didn't exclaim at just the introduction of another regular human NPC?
Brandon: [Laughing] That's a good point!
Julia: I think part of it too, is like you know this is a very modern campaign, and we're in the real world, and not a fantasy setting. So I expect to come across an Ooze in a fantasy setting, I don't expect to come across a talking rabbit butler in a superhero setting.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: True.
Eric: I mean you should—talking rabbit butler. You're just making it sound cool back to me. I'm like man I wish I had a talking rabbit butler that sounds great.
Brandon: Eric, there are two very important questions one, what color suit?
Eric: As I said in the episode January, wears like a blue blue suit.
Brandon: Love it.
Eric: With the gold bow tie and little white rabbit shirt.
Julia: So cute, so cute!
Brandon: Second important question is gold bow tie patterned or just solid gold?
Eric: I think there's like a—
Amanda: Subtle polka dots
Amanda and Brandon: subtle polka dot, subtle polka dot!
Eric: I do like the gold on gold polka dot. I was thinking I guess the word escapes me it's like the the wide checkerboard, it's not a checkerboard—
Amanda: Like a gingham?
Eric: Yeah like maybe—
Amanda: Or plaid?
Eric: Or just like has the paneling in it like it looks like a tile floor, do you know what I'm talking about?
Amanda: Sure like a buffalo check type thing?
Eric: No it's not like a check it's like— this doesn't matter!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Basically, there is a subtle pattern on the bowtie.
[Julia laughing]
Brandon: [in an announcer voice] It's up to your imagination which pattern!
Eric: You can get in the comments, and tell me what pattern it is! But no January is fine, everyone don't worry, I was doing a lot of upstate New York research and I actually started looking at the flora and fauna up there. Especially as you know we're gonna be dealing with the different seasons and we've talked about that a little bit and I saw that snowshoe hares are like mildly endangered in upstate New York, and definitely they're one of the animals that changes their fur color depending on what season it is.
So snowshoe hares are brown during the summer and white during the winter for you know camouflage reasons. So I thought it was interesting because you know this is an upstate sort of game and everyone who lives there has been here for a while. I did like the idea that Dr. Morrow takes things into her own hands and be like “what if endangered rabbit butler?”
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: But what if?
Eric: But what if I did that? And now January is a part of her crew. I mean I love January. I think January is incredibly self-aware, and I just had so much fun being January. Also listening back to it and hearing the initial hair joke I made when Amanda said Aggie O'Hare I was just like I'm so glad I prepared. I knew it was going to happen, it was delightful for me.
Brandon: That was very good.
Julia: It was very very good.
Eric: I think all of you have taken a shine to January though I really—
Julia: Oh yes we love January.
Brandon: Yeah if I could play this campaign as January from now on, I would Eric.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: Backup character.
Brandon: Yeah, Milo on rails the rest of the campaign.
Julia: I meant more like when Milo dies, you know inevitably.
Eric: Well now I have to kill Milo so Brandon can be January. Just to get in my head also for eight as well I think I didn't do a great job setting up the infrastructure of campaign one as a nice place to be. The Speaker was knowledgeable and cold well like hold in a very like ethereal sort of way, and because of like Greg was there and all the people I just really wanted there to be some sort of relationship building here. And Dr. Morrow has followed a similar vein, I think there are large differences between the Speaker and Dr. Morrow as we'll see, and hopefully we'll explore. But I did want to kind of build out the world around her a little bit more so I think that Dez and January mean a lot to me as people for you to bounce off with, and are also like obviously not governmentally and in the in the larger world but like of equal stature and can help you in this hub of using the mansion as a hub and something that you'll end up needing and using and hopefully working with.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: That makes a lot of sense it's easier to see somebody as a person, and to trust them when you see the people that they trust and vice versa.
Julia: Mhm.
Amanda: Well that is a good lead-in to our other January questions, Joey asks this January know I'll die for him?
[Julia laughs]
Eric: I think he does know.
Amanda: Cotton asks—
Eric (as January): Can you just like not be weird for a second? I know it’s on the Internet, and you're not doing it in front of me but can you just not?
Amanda: Cotton asks what is January's favorite pastime?
Eric: Bocce.
[Brandon laughs}
Julia: That’s adorable!
Amanda: So cute! Pan asks does January like his job, or does he just figure it will be hard to get a job elsewhere? Is January legally a person?
[Everyone oooo’s]
Eric: Can we go back to those other questions like what January's favorite things to do is? Um I think it's complicated. We haven't really explored a lot of what happened and why January is the way that they are. But you know like what I always think that Dr. Morrow when she does something, she thinks that she's doing the best thing possible. Sometimes you look at an animal and you're like “I wish you could just talk to me, and I could give you what you want” I think Dr. Morrow was like “I could do that!” And that's what happened. I think January does feel very close to Dr. Morrow, and I feel like I don't know how the awakening the complications of giving life to a creature, and intelligence to a creature is a little complicated, but I feel like they do have a good relationship, and Dr. Morrow trusts January to be their assistant. And as we know from so many movies, and television shows the assistant is just important as the person that they're working for. So January— it's a real like Alfred situation here, except instead of being British they're uh snowshoe hare Michael Caine— imagine Michael Caine as a rabbit.
Brandon: Yeah that's what I was imagining.
Julia: Great.
Eric: No that's good! That means you were ahead of me, I'm so glad we're synced like that.
Brandon: Okay cool.
Julia: I mean from a mechanics perspective January was what like an animal companion that was awakened?
Eric: Yeah like to really kind of do that yeah.
Brandon: Do they have like— I guess you probably can't tell us this yet, but like I assume they have like stats and stuff?
Eric: Yeah I don't have the stats on hand but they are a full NPC. Like they're not just a rabbit in the way that Tuna’s not just the cat you know.
Julia: Mhm.
Brandon: In the way that I am just a druid.
Eric: Yes, Milo is a druid.
Amanda: Speaking of Batcaves Hamilton Otto would like to know how far down does Dr. Morrow's house go and where is the lab?
Brandon: [chanting] Me too, me too!
Eric: It just goes down forever guys.
Julia: Journey to the Center of the Earth style.
Eric: It just keeps going down, you know.
Amanda: I mean it is located in the mountains, so there is a good you know two thousand feet of elevation under Lake Town City.
Eric: In my head there's like five or six floors, but don't quote me on that, but I mean we did go is like one was the receiving floor, and two is the sleeping quarters, and three is where the study and all that stuff is, and then the kitchen is somewhere in there. You know just use your imagination it's as deep as you want. All the floors are there.
Julia: You mean you're not gonna build us out a detailed blueprint of Dr. Morrow’s house?
Eric: Well then I don't get to ask you all what a random things in Dr. Morrow’s house are.
Julia: True.
Eric: Which was truly my favorite part of episode eight when I'm just like hey what's in the kitchen.
Brandon: Yeah I love that, like is that something you picked up just DMing for a while or something like an idea you picked up from online or something? Like bringing your characters to help build the immediate surroundings like that?
Eric: I'm not really sure where I picked it up. I just kind of liked doing it. There are a lot of things that I feel attached to some characters usually, and I do feel attached of like making sure that the NPC's talk in a way that you all can respond to, which is why some of my favorite episodes are ones where we just kind of talk and we make decisions, more so than actually like having conflicts, but like I can't just populate a room 100% like I do want your input especially because this is a fantastical place. I mean we're talking about a kitchen. The thing that the four of us talk about all the time is food and alcohol, like all the time. The amount of food shows all of us watch the entirety of Food Network so I think like this particularly, I want to know your opinion. I personally don't know the world that your characters are inhibiting, so I want you to tell me what that is because it is just like if you had the opportunity to create the community that you were in, you would do it in your own image so as we come up and as you all do your favorite things, I want to do that. I mean a really good example of that was the bowling place right cause it's like you want Brandon you wanted that and then Milo had a bowling place and I'm like some Brandon what does this look like? That's something that I don't I don't feel like I need to put in there, and I obviously your opinion.
Brandon: Yeah I love it, it's just like a really great DM trick I think to make the players feel like they have a lot of input, and say in the world without necessarily changing the scope of the plot and stuff. It's smart.
Eric: Thanks! I tried.
Amanda: And I think that's a good segue into the way we closed out episode eight with everybody's memories, and I know that was something that a lot of the audience in the discord really enjoyed, and I loved it too as players so Julia, Brandon, how did you guys feel about that? I know that for me being prompted by that question, it just sort of came to me you know like I didn't have to ponder for a long time it felt very easy for me to kind of play out that scenario. But what was it like for you two?
Brandon: I think it's super fun! Yeah again going back to that to what I was just saying, like I really that was all my favorite things that we did in the first season, and I remember specifically when because it was fairly early on the first season when Eric asked us that question that was that was one of the times I was like “oh fuck like you can this is how you can DM?” Like this is what DMing could be? Yeah it's one of my favorite things and especially I really like the sort of like feedback mechanism that we go through with Eric where it's like here's a nugget or especially with me because I'm my one of my like weaker points is coming up with like detailed worlds, I can get sort of like the overarching stuff but like I can feed a little nugget of like oh maybe you know maybe his dad had a conversation when he was a kid and he likes comic books. But then Eric can flush out that little nugget and turn it into something really poignant, and meaningful and I really love that. It’s one of my favorite things to do on the show.
Julia: Yeah I really like being prompted for questions about my character’s past I always feel really nervous about it in the moment because, I feel like on the spot and I'm like “oh what I've suddenly forgotten everything that I've established about this character” but the moment that like you finally get to the point where you can start telling that story, I absolutely love that and I love being prompted to do so.
Eric: I will say after playing for a while, I'm starting to understand the way that all of you like to play and how I get the best stuff out of you. Brandon I just ask you questions outside of the recording session, and then you tell me them and then you forget you did it. I'm surprising you with your own answer.
Julia: I love that.
Brandon: [laughing] That’s real. Memento disease!
Eric: There’s nothing I love more especially because now you're on the west coast, when I have a random thing in the middle of the night it's like an actual fine time to DM you. So it’s midnight my time, it's 9:00 P.M. your time, and it's like “So like what does Milo like to eat in the morning?” and you're like this is this and you just totally forget, and then I'm like oh so you know when you go to a diner, and you order your omelet and you're like “how did you know that?!” I'm like well! With Julia it is just about a lot of prompts, and it's about just putting something in front of you because you always just take the thing in front of you, you can't ignore it and I love that.
Julia: Nope! I just pick impulsive characters which I think is my problem, because I'm not a particularly impulsive person so when my characters are impulsive, it's like I'm living that kind of weird fantasy where it's like “oh what if I did just act on everything and the consequences were only in-game and not in real life!”
Eric: It's so good though because it's always reasonable, I think it’s very interesting, and then for Amanda I feel like you and I always take a lot of time and talk about your character a lot. I feel like I know the most about Aggie than I do about any of my characters, or Val, or Milo.
Brandon: Or myself!
Eric: Or me! Or Deric, my DMPC. Deric’s been here the whole time you just haven't seen him yet.
Amanda: DMPC is a very good abbreviation.
Brandon: Oh that's very good, I like it a lot.
Eric: That's like bopping around RPG Internet, I did not come up with that. But I feel like I know a ton about Aggie, like I all I know all of your siblings, I know what they do I know their jobs, I know your parents, I probably know how everyone interacts. Yeah I just keep asking you questions and I mean it helps that we live together, so I can just ask you a question and then write it down. But I think it also this is prompting but then you kind of like fanfiction it out, but because it's a DND podcast, you're doing the actual thing. So it's good.
Amanda: I also think Aggie is a way closer to me than Inara was in terms of my biography, and instincts, and stuff. So it's it's very easy for me to think of how she would react, and to give you details on like endless numbers of Irish Catholic siblings, like I got that.
Eric: Oh what are the names of all of your siblings?
Amanda: [without missing a beat] Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn.
Brandon: Sorry I think the internet broke up what was it Amanda?
Amanda: Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn.
Julia: The emphasis again really really important.
Eric: To that point, I do think that your family is very similar to Aggie’s family so that's incredibly helpful for me playing the siblings.
Amanda: Just leading me to filth in our every interaction.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: I guess I just know the people in your life who are Aggie’s family so it's just very helpful and very fleshed out so to that end I mean I have a lot to work with honestly, and as much, I actually didn't know that was gonna happen, and I would love to talk about episode eight a little bit. I had set this up and the entire time, during the first eight nine-ten episodes of this campaign, I was like this is always gonna be the central question here: are they going to be like spies and is it going to be a this type of campaign maybe something more not Suicide Squad necessarily, but something that's like I'm going to keep my superpowers on the low and when I'm called to a mission I'm gonna do it. Much like I guess a spy movie like you're 007, when you're not actually doing the spy stuff, or we're going to have like an actual capital S Marvel superhero campaign, and I was always waiting for this, and I really hope that I didn't push you one way or another, and Dr. Morrow I think is very much like a know-it-all truly, and it's my ability to convey the mechanics of the world and what she wants, and what might happen in one way or another. But I would really love to know like how did that conversation go both when I laid that out in seven and then as we actually did it in eight, and I think that this was very nicely cut down because we talked about— I answered a lot of questions that I had a lot of like things I wanted to tell you that didn't end up in eight, that really kind of cemented what we were going to do.
Julia: Yeah I feel like Brandon can speak more to like the conversation that got cut, versus what actually ended up in the audio, but I think we I think we established on mic pretty well like I mean for me at least, I was I really thought that Val would not be interested whatsoever in the costume superhero thing.
Amanda: Yeah me too, I walked in thinking that I definitely wanted to do the stealth a superhero situation, and just in conversation with Dr. Morrow like I think Brandon made it flow very well, but I felt like in in the session, I was genuinely wrestling with it like genuinely asking those questions.
Brandon: Yeah me too, I actually I didn't cut a whole ton. I cut because there was a lot of us genuinely like thinking silently to ourselves about what we wanted to do, and then there were a lot of just repeated like “hey can you explain the expand on this more on that?” I cut, but the the meat of the thing was still there and I think I tried to give everyone a chunk of statement about like how they were feeling, and how they were feeling about their character. And yeah like I don't think in the moment I quite understood the quite the quandary that was there of like stealth versus non stealth. But there's also the superhero that's like X-Men where it's like just your face in public versus a mask.
Eric: Yes that was really the big question you were all wrestling with I remember because Val said “I don't want someone to think I'm a superhero while walking a dog” and I'm like buck Dr. Morrow was like “put on a mask?” Like what do you mean?
Amanda: And there's a little bit of like superhero universe hand waving in that like I was thinking this as a person, you know as like a six-foot tall burly lady with red hair, how many of those could there be running around Lake Town City but like A: it's a very big city and B: you know we're having— I think it's fair to say, a tiny bit of hand waving in that we as superheroes won't necessarily like need to do a stealth check every time we're outside the house in costume for somebody to tie it back to our real identities.
Eric: Yeah I think that we need that for the genre, I will say that the three of you are decidedly not like public figures, I know that Agee is, but we've established that historic Lake Town is not actually that big or important in the larger scheme of the city. I know Milo is technically a public figure. but like you work at a museum what would people recognize you and put two and two together, and like Val you literally just do odd jobs. So it's I do think that there is an ability — I don't think people would be able to put two and two together, what I was seating and I think was actually really interesting the three the three of you responding to the bank problem was that if you were not covered up, that is a hundred percent what would happen but I think that once you put the persona on top of it it's like we can't do what happened at the bank again, like we're not doing that again the people can just like take a photo, or it's like on a bank security footage, or all of that like we're not doing that again. But how are you gonna do it are you going to literally hide, are you just going to hide your actual self behind a mask?
Julia: Right.
Brandon: Right. I mean Milo could cause you know he was able to not show himself on the tape—
[Eric and Julia laughing]
Brandon: Like he's shown that he's capable of that but for the other two sake, I think it's important to wear masks.
Amanda: Shout out to Pen of Smiting for the incredible art, particularly of the moment where Aggie’s being confronted by the newspaper salesperson, and just like wow I didn't know anything about the city I guess.
Brandon: I've been loving those comics, those cartoons, those drawing so much!
Julia: They’re so good.
Brandon: They're incredible!
Eric: I think my favorite thing is that they're capturing all of your style so much. I'm like yes that is what Val looks like that is how Aggie dresses, and Mickey yeah Mickey the one who works at Hudson news, in my head is the Hudson news is my favorite NPC, one of my favorites. Just like being able to obviously bust your balls because they have control of bagels and coffee.
Amanda: And we— Eric and I were in in upstate New York last week and we took pictures of all the places that had inspired locations in Laketown City so we took a picture of the actual newsstand where where I get my rolls in coffee when I'm in that town which we can we can post well just slightly edit the picture to display what it really should say on the sign.
Eric: What are you talking about? Lake Town City's real, I saw a street sign and I put it up.
Amanda: Let's check out Instagram @jointhepartypod.
Eric: So I definitely want to know how did you feel— did you feel the weight of this changing? Because I had been anticipating this for so long, were you just making a decision for your character, or did you feel like this was cementing the campaign moving forward?
Julia: So I feel like I knew what I wanted to do going into the session but, I also knew that I would be swayed either way depending on whether or not Val was convinced, and I think at the end of the day that was convinced because Val thought that like “hey I have a gift I have something that's special about me” and being able to show that off, even if it's not being like hey I'm me who is also a superhero is something that I think really convinced them at the end of the day.
Amanda: Yeah I also felt that like I knew the like named superhero route would be more interesting for the podcast, but in setting up the world together we all had very open conversations in our session zeros about the fact that any version of powered people in a modern setting would be interesting to us. So I didn't feel as if like like you would have said if we had to do a certain route or in advance of the podcast we would have all agreed if it had to be named superheroes with personas, or nothing, and that wasn't the case so I felt a lot of freedom to choose what I thought was best for the character. And I didn't expect my mind being changed that way but I think that Dr. Morrow being — how do I put this? Optimistic? And having a lot of resources swayed it, and I don't know I feel like I wanted to make the more interesting choice and for Aggie that was a little out of character but for me that's what I want to do when presented with two equal options you know.
Brandon: Yeah totally the same for me, I think like I did know in the moment that this was sort of like one of the defining moments of the show, so I wanted to make sure we made them as interesting one as a player involved. But I also think like from Milo it was a genuine toss up because he wants to maintain anonymity because he is who he is, he likes you know showing people museum artifacts, but not necessarily being on the cover of People magazine. But at the same time like his heroes are all are on the cover of People magazine, so like I think it was genuinely a toss up for him as a character. So either way we would have gone, it would have been interesting for him as a character.
Eric: That’s true, you did just have your hero ask you if you wanted to put on tights and a cape, so I don't think that Milo was gonna say no at all.
Brandon: Exactly.
Julia: Gotta love the proposal.
Brandon: It's weird that we're married now.
Eric: [Laughing] This goes really nicely it do a new segment I want to introduce it's called: Remember When We Made These Good Jokes?
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: I like this segment, go ahead.
Eric: We’ve recorded so far in advance, and also just like I totally black out when I'm playing Dungeons & Dragons, I do not remember what we do. So listening back to these episodes is actually very funny in the beginning of seven, we talked about Dr. Morrow's memoir, where I do my favorite thing and actually make you name things. So I was like “Hey Brandon what's the name of Dr. Morrow's memoir” I wrote this down you said Tomorrow is Always Just a Day Away: the Life and Times of Dr. Morrow, and we said “what's another way of saying that?” you said “Tomorrow is Just Today But in the Future”
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Then we also said “Thinking About Tomorrow” and then “2 Morrow” with the twom and then “Days of Future Tomorrow” but that's the graphic novel version.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Mhm.
Eric: The other one that Amanda this was so funny in our recurring joke about Star Trek. You guys are Star Trek nerds, but not Dungeons & Dragons nerds. Aggie telling Milo that he's locked in the holodeck and he just needs to chill and wait for things to kinda deal.
[Everyone laughing]
Brandon: So good.
Amanda: Very good, it’s true!
Eric: It’s so funny, in episode eight we then say that canonically Richard Blais lives in Lake Town City.
Amanda: He does! He does, him in Al Gore have dinner parties all the time.
Brandon: That was difficult to cut around like the way we said it up was weird, and but I wanted to make sure so hard that it stayed in there.
Eric: It was around the plasma salamander too - which was very good. For those of you don't know who he is Richard Blais is like a Food Network Star. He's a very popular chef and he was on Top Chef for a while where he really hated himself, but then he got like a really strong glow up and now he's like very hip and looks incredibly good. Just from like a haircut in some glasses.
Amanda: Just from being rich.
Eric: Yeah and he also his thing is like gastronomy, so he's one of the person who like pours liquid nitrogen—
Julia: The molecular gastronomy stuff.
Eric: Yeah like he's very like molecular gastronomy guy, but he's also like he's like an attractive food scientist.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: He was so sad on Top Chef all the time, he was so down on himself.
Eric: Amanda and I send this to each other all the time, and we'll tweet this out but there is a moment in Top Chef in the final where he he’s talking to the camera and he's like “immediately when I make things I hate it and I hate everything I do”
Brandon: Wait that’s real?!
Eric: Yeah no it's Antonia Lofaso, who's in the finals with him is just like “what the hell is wrong with you?” and he just like deadpans.
Amanda: Yeah it's like a very sullen screencap and it's it's a little duo that I just have on hand in my favorites album, just for when I need it so we’ll be sure and put that on Twitter.
Brandon: That’s wild.
Eric: And then the final joke I liked how we just talked about Spy Kids a bunch with Dez.
Brandon: Okay I left the Froot Loops joke in there that Amanda made, I don't— what is— I haven't seen Spy Kids is there a Froot Loops reference?
Julia: Yeah there's like those creepy things, hold on, I’ll send—
Brandon: I also googled it you couldn't find it in that specific phrasing so.
Amanda: It's called Floop’s Fooglies.
Brandon: What the fuck?
Julia: Hold on Brandon I'm sending it to you right now.
Amanda: Yeah it's the villain in Spy Kids and he like makes people into like candy thumbs they're called Floop’s Fooglies.
Julia: Here it's in the chat now.
Amanda: Oh my god, Julia his name is Fegan Floop.
Julia: Yep, yes he is!
Eric: Is he played by Alan Cumming?
Amanda: Oh sure is!
Julia: Yes he is!
Amanda: Oh I wish I named one of Aggie siblings Fegan now.
Eric: That's very good.
Amanda: Damn!
Eric: I will say Spy Kids has a lot of really strong mediatized, because that's where Danny Trejo premiered the character of Machete.
Julia: Machete yes!
Eric: Which is wild to me.
Brandon: Oh my god this is incredible.
Amanda: 90's kids will know.
Eric: [Laughing] 90’s kids will know Floops Fooglies.
Brandon: Oh no I hate this! Oh no, oh no.
Eric: As Brandon is writhing in horror, I do want to clarify something about Dez, in my head Dez is a black man he's older and he has a gruff voice, but when I said he had really long hair in my head he has like gray dreadlocks that are tied up but it still goes all the way down his back, and to his butt. There was something someone tweeted at me that I did mention he was on a baton scholarship to Grambling. Grambling is a historically black college, with a very good football team, so in my head Dez is a black man. That’s just something I wanted to clarify.
Julia: I would like you to know that Val 100% would have been totally into Dez, hundred percent.
Amanda: Oh yeah,
Julia: Cause like he walked out and Val was like “excellent, you're great. Everything about this”
Amanda: I feel like Aggie doesn't like committing to friendships where you do regular activities but, Aggie with a thousand percent commit to like a regular bar night with Dez.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: 100%
Branond: So far we have our NPC ranking. First we have January, and then Dez, Dr. Morrow
Julia: Mhm.
Amanda: Yep.
Julia: And then all the way at the bottom Sour Anthony.
Amanda: Oh man now I really want to see Dez and Sour Anthony interact.
Eric: I don't know how it would actually exactly happen. When it does happen I'm gonna be very excited about doing those voices at each other.
Amanda: Incredible, cotton asks in discord what is Dez’s favorite invention that he's made?
Eric: Oh that's a good question, this was around the time that I was watching a lot of Full Metal Alchemist, so I think that Dez worked on their own prosthetic, and the fact that it is very articulated and very strong, and good. Like there's a lot of like pistons, and inner workings, and that thing to make it as fully articulated like who knows if there's other stuff in there. We haven't really talked about it I only saw it as a hand. So I think that Dez is very proud of that. That's probably like mark 5 of Dez's arm.
Brandon: That's cool, that's very cool.
Julia: I love it. Dez is very cool so.
Eric: Oh the person who asked me if January was a chimera like in Full Metal Alchemist, no that’s not what happened that's really messed up. January is a fine and happy rabbit lad! That’s not what happened! So I just wanted to clarify that January's just an awakened rabbit. Nothing terrible and untoward happened!
Julia: Not a chimera!
Amanda: and Thomas the DM on Twitter asks does Dr. Morrow have more animal companions? Is February a giant dove? is October a giant spider who makes all of her clothes? Is December a buff bipedal reindeer who screams in Christmas carols?
[Brandon and Eric laughing]
Juia: December’s my favorite out that list hot damn.
Amanda: Excellent world building.
Eric: October exists none of the other ones exist.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Yeah she she just like casually like seemingly all women in their 50s has an all silk wardrobe.
Julia: Obviously.
Amanda: I look forward to that.
Julia: All muumuus.
Amanda: Oh yeah.

[Transition note]
Amanda: Paul asks in the discord Eric why did you choose to focus on consumable and single-use items this time around as opposed to the longer-term items in the last campaign, and I'll add is that a focus right now, or is that something you want to continue forward in the rest of the arcs?
Eric: That's a good question! This was just the stuff that Dez had on hand and I think this is like to demonstrate that Dr. Morrow's crew could help you out in this particular way so I think that y'all can keep using this, and Dez and keep making them for you, but I would love to make some more stable items in the future. It didn't really come up this really felt like a real origin story sort of thing, in a way that I couldn't really get around and will kick this into high gear when we get to the next arc but really felt like I had to set a lot of stuff up, and be like use these, it is expendable but I will say that there aren’t a lot of resources in terms of consumable items, there's a lot of like “magic items that you're tuned to and it's a curse and you're always with it all the time!” So the fact that you can just like “oh I'm gonna pop this gum and breathe fire or ice” I think is something necessary and maybe can build and kind of the mystique of whatever as we get to what your actual super hero characters are. Really got to build your brand.
Amanda: Sammich239 in the discord asks Brandon as a fellow bowler what is Milo's handicap and what is his personal best?
Brandon: You can't see what I'm clenching my teeth right now.
Julia: Brandon starts googling that.
Eric: [laughing] My favorite thing about Brandon's characters is that he gives them interests that he doesn’t have and then he’s like uhhhhhh?
Julia: When Brandon was still recording in the studio with us I remember looking over and he had just like a bunch of Douglas Adams facts I'm like what? What’re you doing?!
Amanda: Hello fellow kids!
Brandon: Milo's handicap, well as we all know something around 200 is common, so probably like 204.
Amanda: Good lord. Okay I think it is whatever you need it to be Sammich, I think you are the authority here.
Brandon: I do really like bowling, I just don't know anything about it like as an actual sport.
Julia: Not competitive bowling.
Brandon: Yeah!
Julia: You're not in a league or anything.
Brandon: I wish I was, it would be fun I just would be embarrassed cause I'm so bad.
Eric: My dad was a competitive bowler.
Amanda: What?!
Julia: So was mine.
Eric: There’s nothing to do in Long Island/Erie Pennsylvania what are you supposed to do? So you go bowling.
Brandon: Do you guys think you’re siblings?
Julia: Yeah that'd be weird.
Eric: Listen, everyone in America is related to each other, so it's entirely possible.
Julia: That’s true.
Amanda: Julia, Lada asked on Twitter is there a question that Val would not answer with “fuck you”
Julia: I don't know, fuck you is so versatile, you know? You could say it lovingly, you can say it angrily, any question can be answered with fuck you if you try hard enough.
Amanda: And Iconocat also asked on Twitter if Val is religious. I fell maybe to a priest Val might not say fuck you, but maybe, maybe they would.
Julia: Yeah no, I don't think so you gotta respect the Priesthood. Every time I say that is fucking hilarious.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Yeah no I think Val is like a non-practicing Catholic, like someone who is raised in the church and definitely was something that was instilled in them, but Val is not at church every Sunday, probably goes for like the the High Holidays and stuff like that like Christmas Mass at midnight, that kind of thing but definitely not like there every Sunday.
Amanda: Eric, Jennifer asked via email is the Knight of Mirrors an Easter Egg for Don Quixote?
Eric: Yes it is! Good job! Books are good!
Amanda: I actually never read that in the course of my extremely long studies.
Julia: Yeah I was gonna say explain it please.
Eric: Yeah Don Quixote, I mean it's been a long time since I've read it, and I had to do a bunch of research and Wikipedia and shout out to Misha Stanton for reminding me that this existed! Thanks Misha!
Brandon: Misha!
Eric: The Knight of Mirrors, I mean everything in Don Quixote is like a metaphor for something else, so the Knight of Mirrors is like literally an who rides with shiny armor, and it's supposed to be like the armor is a reflection of society. So it's kind of like a person who was like misguided and takes it upon themselves to be the mirror of the evils, and ways and all that stuff so it was a reference to that. I mean what we know of the Knight of Mirrors took it upon himself to be a vigilante, and clean up something, I mean maybe they know more. They were going out there, and riding on their motorcycle, and doing stuff so it's very similar.
Julia: As we like to say: who can say?
Eric: Who can really say?
Amanda: Who can say. Sarah had something to say on Twitter about our sort of headcanon here: “I'm sorry but if you don't think Dr. Morrow doesn't have one of those ice makers that make teeny tiny ice cubes you're wrong”
Julia: Yes correct, correct wait crunchy ice.
Brandon: Wait, oh like crushed ice?
Julia: No crunch ice!
Eric: This is a funny thing I wanted to ask Brandon about so we go to Dr. Morrow's office, and you see the soda machine that gives you like whatever things and and you're like “oh I'm gonna try it I'm gonna get a refreshing cold drink” and then Milo immediately goes “I want a hot drink”
Julia: Yeah what was that a reference to?
Brandon: It's what Captain Picard always orders, and so that's why I what you didn't hear in the in the edit was that I had to do a retake cause I I swapped one of them and I was like “I'm gonna get so much shit for this” I had to retake it make sure I got it right. But Next Gen is the best Star Trek I've been watching Star Trek since I was like four or five, and Next Gen was—
Julia: Aw, hell yeah!
Brandon: I think was the one that was actually airing when we were growing up, that and the one with Janeway and so those are the two I started with and so like Piccard was like my father figure growing up. Cause he was cool and collected, and it's bald, and it was he was a cool guy.
Julia: Love that man.
Eric: This is actually secretly a Star Trek podcast, get used to it.
Amanda: In further worlds building questions AlIie asked via email in LTC with all the teens and kids being affected by the incident, did animals and pets also get affected as well? Is that why Milo can see Tuna and could Monty be a real thing that was caught in the incident?
[Everyone Oooo’s]
Brandon: This is a who can say.
Amanda: My headcanon totally, and that's why when we were talking about monsters in the building the town lore, that really struck me as a thing that could potentially be possible, like one of my touchstone series as a kid was The Simpsons and seeing the three-eyed fish blinking in the and the river always kind of stuck with me.
Brandon: I love that.
Eric: This is related to something Hamilton Otto asked in the discord, are there other people that are affected by the Delta radiation that weren't contained maybe people who've been hiking or some other passers through or people on their first or last vacation that were in part of the quarantine. So yeah I mean my touchstone for this particular incident was the first episode of Static Shock, the TV show where there's just like that big chemical explosion and then whoever was there got hit and then got powers from it. So I think that we don't necessarily know who has powers, and who don't because of how murky it is of parentage, and who was around. So I think to all of this end we don't necessarily know what the effect of Delta radiation is so all of these things are still on the table, what I can say is who can say it is something I've been thinking about.
Julia: Cool. Cool, cool, cool.
Amanda: Astha asked Golden Knight, Knight of Mirror any relation? Is there some kind of secret knights of the round table hero force coming up?
Julia: Ooh!
Brandon: Who can say!
Everyone: Who can say!
Eric: I think it is something to think about that people who see themselves as superheroes also see themselves as Knights and righting wrongs and running around. So that's what I was thinking, but I also was thinking about hockey teams so yeah. That was on me, I came up with that. I really wanted to fill that in for for Milo's history check on that and that did come from the top of my head. But it was something that to that end. We also don't know if the Golden Knight had powers because everything that I said there was mechanical, that they had like rocket boots and stuff so that's kind of up in the air.
Brandon: That was one of my favorite moments because one, because Eric totally improvised that, and then Julia and I, actually back and forth about the hockey team was it makes me laugh every time I hear it.
Julia: They named him what?!
Eric: They named him after a different hockey team in a different place that doesn't make any sense!
Brandon: Your delivery on the why Julia was just like ugh, perfection.
Amanda: Speaking of kind of process in improvisation, Kalista asks in the discord: Eric how do you create landscapes of improv scenes that you hadn't thought about or planned and for players? Where do your jokes come from?
Brandon: Well when I was growing up I had two siblings that were very mean, and I was the youngest I had to learn how to defend myself via jokes.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Mine's also a defense mechanism yoo!
Eric: Yo mine’s also defense mechanism yo!
Amanda: Me too! I cover up all my insecurities of humor!
Eric: Is that the answer y’all wanted to see?
Julia: I just learned to say funny things I dunno.
Eric: Here's a weird thing of how I see my creative process especially in the way that the world is terrible, and we're all kind of like in our own little bubbles here. When I play dungeon dragons, and also when we do a lot of like creative just like I do building of stuff whether it's like podcasts, or whatever I feel like my brain is like an engine, and I just kind of like turn it on, and then it just like starts the making of things you know? It's like this is the makeamatron, and it makes things and like a—
Brandon: That’s your new nickname Dr. Makeamatron.
Eric: Thank you. And I turn it on and it's just like the way that my brain functions, and then after I'm done I need to like go lay down, like in front of an air conditioning.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Like it's really that's just truly how I see my brain and how I create and make things. So it's just something that's embedded in me, I've always liked telling stories and I've gotten really aware especially from watching and listening to a lot of D&D media, and just like the way that people improvisationally create worlds. I'm just like alright gotta throw in details and then everything kind of builds on top of each other. Everything for my improv of D&D is just cause and effect, it's like if this happens then this has to happen, and then this has to happen, like these things need to exist whether we're talking about a fight, or a room, or a city, or the laws of physics, or the the story building laws that we have in place.
Brandon: Yeah my favorite— well one you could definitely see Eric go into Dr. Makeamatron mode which is just fun and interesting.
Eric: First of all it's makeamatron 3000 please.
Brandon: Sorry, Dr. Makeamatron 3000.
Julia: Of course.
Brandon: And like the thing that really impresses me most just to like brag on Eric for a little bit: is t's so incredibly difficult to improvise where what you're improvising is the perfect balance of like detailed, and specific, but those detail specifics have relevance to the larger world, or to the larger plot, or to the larger idea. Like I can only improv like huge overarching things, and some people can only improv details, and when you just have details it just like is like random, and random humor is not always funny, but Eric has this really innate ability just to like pull specific details that then have meaning to the larger whole which is very impressive.
Eric: Oh thank you I appreciate that. I think the best thing to know about Dungeons & Dragons and DMing and this kind of creative work that we do is just like knowing what your strengths are, and leaning in it so as long as you all don't get bored of me coming up with worlds, and you talking to characters and stuff like maybe I don't have the greatest accents, and voices but like I will be able to create people for you to talk to in front of you, so I just really try to lean into that.
Brandon: Dez's character voice by the way was new and really really interesting and engaging.
Amanda: Yeah me too! That's actually a good segue we could probably do a full after-party about SLaM, and I hope this is not our last visit to this universe because it was so much fun but how do you—
Eric: The good LBB!
Julia: Good ol’ Lagoon Burrough Burg!
Amanda: How did you go about world building for a one-shot versus for our campaign, just in brief kind of how was your prep different?
Eric: Honestly I left a lot up to you guys I think it was really really fun for me to just ask you all questions, and I'm like for a one-shot it doesn't matter like I don't feel as tied to it so I'm just like hey what does your office look like what does the city look like well how do you interact with each other. It was just like us messing around and having a good time, so the fact that I get to ask y'all questions, I mean the fact that the office was on top of a sushi place was incredibly funny and—
Brandon: Amanda that was perfect.
Amanda: Thank you.
Eric: And just like and then the you're the secretary which tied into the ending it's like when you give me those details that I don't have to do it, and then I can slot them in to the thing that I already want to happen, because of the one shot it's just like okay let's meet the characters, let's do some challenges let's take them to a different place, and then I knew that the twist at the end was going to happen. So I'm just like boom boom boom, and then we can have fun world building together. I mean DMing when you do it like this it's just asking questions, and you ask questions, and then you have to roll with it, and we're all very funny, and creative so it all kind of worked out.
Amanda: Cool and the only spoiler corners for this episode are whether Tegan/January/Dez are the Knight of Mirrors. So all we can say is who can say?
Julia: Who can say?
Brandon: If January is the Knight of Mirrors, I'm going to die.
Eric: I will say to this end the next episodes like nine going forward, are some of my favorite episodes and sessions on the Dragons I've ever played. This is what we were talking about nine going forward and then the one shot, I'm was so proud of me and all of us. Like this it's gonna be hot shit, I'm so fucking excited.
Amanda: I can't wait, I can't wait!
Brandon: Same.
Amanda: And yeah I'm so glad that we get the chance to do these afterparties much closer to their release date instead of recording them like right after the session, because we are probably three or four sessions ahead of what's airing at this point. So it's exciting for us that we know what's happening and to be able to put them out, but that also allows us to address more contemporaneous you know events, and things that are going on in the broader kind of RPG community. It's definitely been an eventful few weeks so we wanted to make sure just kind of touch on that because this afterparty isn't just about our show but it's about the environment that our show takes place in.
Eric: Yeah so you might have seen a little while ago that we made a statement from the Join the Party Twitter and Instagram about our relationship to Dungeons & Dragons and the company Wizards of the Coast that publishes and it kind of runs the official Dungeons & Dragons, like they're the people who makes the Monster Manual, and the DM’s guide and also all of like the campaign modules you might see out there. Recently they've kind of to say it lightly been stepping in it and have been doing a lot of stuff that have been really anathema to the work that we do here in Multitude. The way that we conduct ourselves like on a personal level, but also in society which is a big deal and a something that we need to do more than ever just the way the 2020 has been shaking out. To this this point Wizards the Coasts been doing a lot of things have really been bothering me personally, and I just wanted to quickly touch on a lot of this stuff, and like all this stuff has happened since the beginning of June, you saw that a lot of places were making statements when the George Floyd protests were beginning to demonstrate their support of Black Lives Matter. But a lot of places a lot of companies didn't mention black people at all, didn't mention the protests, and Wizards of the Coast was one of them. The protest happened that weekend, and they didn't make a statement until June 1st that was that Wednesday, nowhere in there where black people mentioned, the company talks about donating to black centric charities, but doesn't say how much, or why, and doesn't talk about police brutality, or George Floyd at all. Two weeks later they talked about steps they were going to make for diversity in Dungeons & Dragons. One of which is like the fantasy racism that we always talk about how like orcs and drow just because they're dark-skinned encoded like that in fantasy they're automatically bad, they were said they were going to take steps to doing that it felt like a lot of too little too late sort of things. And then some other stuff started piling on for example in the DM’s Guild, which is kind of like a marketplace that they run where people who aren't working for Wizards of the coast can sell stuff, they removed an adventure called Curse of Hearts which was kind of like sexually explicit but had monsters then were like definitely obviously queer coded, and Wizards of the Coast removed it. Just saying that like because of the sexuality of that, but of course there's a lot of stuff in Dungeons & Dragons in general that are also sexual but are heterosexual coded who's like we you can see this harpy has like the curve of boobs, and shows skin. So it's like are they selectively putting out the things that they think are sexually explicit or not?
Amanda: But they also decided to do that and not remove obviously racist material that others were selling, and that they themselves still publish.
Eric: Right we just tied to another thing which is they have a lot of legacy content you can still buy online, one of which was Oriental Adventures, which was as you might have guessed some Asian pastiche stuff put together by white people, although there is now a statement that they added on it didn't really tell people that it was happening kind of like the “well this is from a different time, this doesn't reflect how we feel now” they're still selling it, and they're still gonna take your money from doing it, and then notedly Orion Black also known as Dungeon Commander who made the game Plot Armor which we played in between the two campaigns. Orion Black worked for them, and had an incredibly terrible experience as a black person being a part of Wizards of the Coast. We’ll link to their statement, but there was a lot of just like things that I wouldn't be able to— no one should be able to deal with during their working time there. And then Wizards of the Coast tweeted out an apology to them, and never reached out to them, which was a whole other thing and like super messy. So there's the way that the company Wizards of the Coast is running their their business, and how many missteps they've been doing since just in June— only six weeks ago has really been frustrating, and is not something that we try to do in our own game, in the way then we conduct ourselves. Wizards of the Coast is not Dungeons & Dragons, I don't think about Wizards of the Coast a lot when I run our own games, we don't use the modules, and like yeah we use the Monster Manual sometimes, and things are straight. But like a company does not run the game that we run, and I think it was important for us not to condone the things out there and not recommend, and continually plug the stuff that Wizards of the Coast makes. It was a really important issue to me and I know that we're still gonna play Dungeons & Dragons, because this is our game, we just started this story and we want to teach people how to play this game. But I don't feel like I can be a party to promoting Wizards of the Coast material on Join the Party, after all these things they've done. Because this isn't just one, it was important for me to lay all this out these are like five or six things in a row that were reprehensible, and I can't get my head around why this is happening.
Amanda: Yeah it's it's important to recognize that the the game is not just limited to like the canon, and to the publisher, and everybody listening here knows that games are made at the table, not in the publishing house. And so it's important to us to continue to take cues from the black, and brown, indigenous, POC players in the broader tabletop, and D&D community, because we are playing this game because we love and we believe in the community and we know that the community is holding each other to a higher standard than clearly the like guidance from the top. So you know companies put out statements cause they're afraid of what people will say if they don't, and putting out inadequate statements that don't actually say anything is not an answer. That's why it's important for us to address this and to as a broader D&D podcasting community continue to hold Wizards accountable for the work that they still need to do which is massive. And for anybody who wants to learn more and to get some kind of recommended follows of black people in the DND community who are doing great reporting and leadership on these issues, we have a list in the description of this afterparty, so please give them a follow, and go ahead and support with your money through patronage, and through purchases the art and the game design that these folks are doing.
Eric: And in the Asian community they really put themselves out and were exposed to a lot of the worst parts in the table top and DND community and we’re pointing to them as well.
Brandon: Yeah, go buy Plot Armor as an example. Eric did a one-shot of it. It was an amazing RPG.
Eric: Orion is so talented, and if you’re losing them, and treating them this poorly, then I don’t know what you’re doing. Like you obviously have all of your priorities fucked up.
Amanda: Well that is all for us in today’s afterparty. We look forward to bringing another one to you next month for the next two episodes of this campaign and please go ahead and click those links and follow those artists in the description. That is how we make the gaming community better, and more resilient which is through supporting with our dollars people’s who’s work we want to see continue.
Eric: Absolutely, and for sure, these next episodes I’m very excited for!
Julia: So stoked.
Amanda: We’ll see you then!
Brandon: Bye guys!
Julia: Later!

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party.
[Music Starts]
Eric: The party drives up to Dr. Morrow’s quaint cabin to get some answers about Lake Town City. They’re greeted at the door by January, the awakened Snowshoe hare. January, who is adorable in his navy blue suit jacket and gold bowtie and is totally fine – please, I promise – leads them into the cabin, which is much bigger on the inside. Dr. Morrow receives Milo, Val, and Aggie in her wonderful invention emporium, which is just her study. She reveals that she knows that they have powers and where the powers came from. Her initial discovery of the volatile element, diaphorum, happened in the original Lake Town back in 1985. Remember Episode 1? And that discovery irradiated their families that live there. That delta radiation, because it’s one better than gamma radiation, made people like Aggie’s parents and Val’s mom look great and have better aptitude, but the next generation got real powers. Dr. Morrow also worked with Milo’s adopted father, Hank Lane, as a part of the Office of Technology Assessment, to see how Lake Town would eventually grow into Lake Town City. Now, they have a choice. Do they want to work with Mayor Dr. Morrow to fight against the growing strangeness in the city? And do they want to be public with their powers or not? Uhhhhh, good question. Let’s get the party started.
[Theme Music]
[Music Fadeout]
[Birds chirping]
Amanda (as Aggie): I mean I can only speak for myself, but, for me, the answer is yes. And we'll – we'll figure out the hows, but I want to continue to live my life and do this as well.
Eric: Okay.
Julia (as Val): I-I could, you know, potentially see myself mmm... signing up for a limited trial run kind of thing.
Eric: Okay. We have yes to a limited trial run of a dangerous Strikeforce to defend the city.
Julia: Mhmm. Sure.
Eric: Oh, that's – I'll take that.
Julia: I'm not calling myself Puncherella or whatever, but—
Eric: Or, you don't need a code – you can or cannot have a code name. I'm gonna keep Puncherella on the whiteboard.
Julia: I fucking hate it.
Brandon (as Milo): Ummm... Dr. Cassandra Morrow, I've been waiting my entire life for you to ask me this question. Yes, a thousand times. Yes.
Julia: Why did it sound like he was – he was saying yes to a proposal?
Amanda: Yeah, I know. It really was.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: It is a proposal when you think about it.
Julia: Now, for like—
Brandon: What?
Amanda: I see what you mean—
Eric: We're married now. Congratulations.
Amanda: Please do not joke with him.
Julia: You really should joke with him about that.
Brandon: Do not do that. No.
Eric: That’s, that's on me. I shouldn't have – I shouldn't have joked. Well, I wasn't expecting a yes so soon, but I appreciate that you devoting yourself to-to the city and in some ways the ideals started by me and your – your parents back – back in the 80s. I appreciate your honesty. I appreciate your commitment. And I appreciate the cool stuff we're going to do together. Dr. Morrow has dropped quite a lot on you. And, you know, she-she understands body language and stuff. So, she claps—
Amanda: Is that on her character sheet? Is that one of her languages?
Eric: Yeah, she's in—
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: She understands—
Brandon: Body.
Eric: She understands how humans react to things.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: So, she clasps her hand together and say, “I know we've talked – we've talked for a long time and you know what I love to do is talk about the philosophical ramifications of the decisions I've just made. So, I – does anyone want to stay up for another few hours and talk about it?”
Julia (as Val): Uh. No. First off, I'm not super into philosophy. I got a C in Philosophy at SUNY Lake Town City. That's the best I can do. What I would love to do is, I burned a lot of calories before and maybe we could, you know, bulk up a little, get some carbs in us. I think I could probably make some pasta? You seem like the kind of person who's got pasta.
Brandon (as Milo): I would love some pasta. Are you – are you—
Julia: Alright.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh my god. Yeah. I could help.
Julia (as Val): Pasta. Pasta. Pasta.
Amanda: Let's do it.
Eric: Excelsior!
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: That was a good Stan Lee reference. Good job.
Eric: No, I don't know if I want to say – I don't know if I want to say Excelsior.
Amanda: Do you, do you just say – did you just say Excelsior as like a transition? Because an assemblyman once yelled at me at the State Capitol that I didn't know what Excelsior meant. So, now, I know what it means. Ever upward.
Eric: Yeah. No, that's more of a—
Julia: Also, fun fact, it is the, the state logo of New York State.
Amanda: Yeah, that's why the assemblyman yelled at me.
Eric: No, I did—
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I knew all of those things. It's more I don't usually – you know, maybe I've just been staring at too many – too much Latin. You know, in my – in my usual studies, I’ll just pop over and just look at some, some state logos and stuff. It gets into my head. To the kitchen! And, now – so, let's go to Dr. Morrow’s kitchen. I want everyone to name one thing that's in it.
Amanda: Extremely large wine glasses. Like, they could fit a full 16 ounces in there.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: Like a very old fashioned KitchenAid mixer.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: Very good.
Julia: In like Chrome. It's full Chrome.
Eric: I like that it might have had other ones on it.
Brandon: I love that.
Eric: But, eventually, she just kind of like took it off and just put like – it's like see-through. You know – you know those like old 90s and 2000s like purple—
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Purple Gameboy shells?
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: It’s like that, but it's just totally see-through. So, you can see all the guts.
Amanda: I want that.
Eric: Oh, yeah, they’re very good.
Julia: That's the kind of Game Boy I had.
Brandon: I'm gonna say full-size commercial salamander, but, instead of flame, it's plasma.
Amanda: Oooh, I’m so jealous.
Julia: Hell yeah.
Eric: Ooh, that's true.
Julia: Get that cheese bubbling in like two seconds. Yep.
Eric: I love when my good friend, Richard Blais, comes over to check out—
Julia: No make that canonical right now.
Eric: Richard Blais – yeah, sure. Richard Blais can live in Lake Town City.
Amanda: He's really good friends with Al Gore. So, that makes sense.
Julia: I feel like he summers in Lake Town City. And then he does his cheffing thing back in New York. That's my thought.
Eric: He has a restaurant thing. I think he's leading – the Molecular Gastronomy Movement at Lake Town City is from Richard Blais.
Amanda: Sweet.
Brandon: He's just spherical-izing everything
Julia: It is now my canonical goal to make sure that Val and Richard Blais become best friends.
Eric: Listen, we got downtime. That's fine if that's what you want to work on.
Amanda: Similar hair.
Julia: Similar hair. Similar vibe.
Brandon: The pizza is about to get real modern.
Amanda: I think Aggie will very familiarly sling her coat over the back of like a chair at the breakfast bar and sort of sit at like a giant kitchen island looking over the kitchen.
Eric: Yeah, I like the idea that this is like a 1950s diner-style kitchen. It looks – it has that aesthetic. But I think I like the idea that you're cooking in it. There's a lot of neon. Everything is like bright blue, and bright pink, and very – like, she has a booth in there, which I find charming. Like, instead of a breakfast nook, it's a diner booth. But, also, there's—
Brandon: That’s delightful.
Eric: It’s – wouldn't that be so delightful instead of a breakfast nook, like—
Brandon: It really would.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: There's a giant window, but you're sitting at a diner booth?
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric: And then, of course, there's like the – everything that we talked about just beautiful. Nancy Meyers cooking utensils. Like, everything is Chrome and, yet, there's like incredibly scientific stuff like the plasma salamander. It actually – it gives it more of an oaky note. You'd be surprised. And then it gets smoked just from the way the molecules move around.
Amanda: That's amazing.
Julia: Val’s like, “I don't know what that means.” And then just starts going through the cabinets and the fridge without asking and pulling out all the ingredients that they need.
Eric: Wonderful. Milo, I want you to make an animal handling check. And Val, what are you making?
Julia (as Val): Breakfast carbonara.
Eric: Amazing.
Brandon (as Milo): That sounds so good.
Julia (as Val): It's very good.
Brandon (as Milo): I got a 18 + 5 or 23.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: Wonderful. Okay. You're kind of like floating behind Val a little bit as Val’s making this. And just like I don't even how to make it roll. Like, I bet Val could do this in her sleep, truly.
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Eric: And you see that Tuna pops up and kind of like stalks over on the kitchen island to, like, take a peek over there. But you know what cats like – they do their – their preparation? Like, it leans down and like waggles their tail, like, from one side and the other to get oriented. So, Tuna’s, like, leaned over. And then it's like there's a moment of stillness that no one knows what's happening – no one knows what’s happening. And Tuna just jumps. And, all of a sudden, you see Dr. Morrow reach for something really quickly and just throw it at Tuna. And there's a puff of just like white dust everywhere.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
Eric: I know.
Brandon (as Milo): That's my cat!
Eric: Tuna is now just covered in flour.
[Players laughing]
Eric: But, now, everyone can see Tuna.
Julia: Tunaaaa!
Amanda: Tuna really nice to meet you, finally.
Eric (as Tuna): Hmm. I just assumed that everyone could see me. That's just the way that I treat myself.
Brandon (as Milo): you- you- you-
Eric (as Tuna): Live, laugh, love, but in the opposite way.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna, you know that's not true.
Eric: You know, you – you never know what kind of invisible monsters are lurking around. So, I guess we could all see the cat now. Wonderful. That's good.
Brandon (as Milo): I mean you're not wrong. It – Tuna is an invisible monster.
Julia: I'm just still not sure why I could see the cat, and how you couldn't see the cat. But, you know, philosophical question for another time.
Eric: Now, Milo, when were you touching Val? Hmm.
Brandon (as Milo): When was I touching Val?
Eric: Hmmm... hmmm...
Julia (as Val): Was this when you fell and then I had to carry you?
Brandon (as Milo): Oh, yeah. I promise I did not touch you though.
Julia (as Val): There we go.
Brandon (as Milo): It was completely touch-less.
Julia (as Val): Okay. Let's have all touches be consensual from now on.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay. Yes, I agree.
Eric (Dr. Morrow): Milo, we have a lot to discuss about on like how – how all this works. I'm really just fascinated. I would love to just – to just come over and we could just talk about everything here.
Brandon (as Milo): I would love that if that – if we could do that. I have so many questions for you.
Eric (Dr. Morrow): And I have questions for you. We'll get something on the calendar. That sounds great. January!
Eric: January hops into the kitchen.
Brandon (as Milo): January is way too long. Oh, sorry. You meant the rabbit.
Eric: Boo!
Julia: Boo! Bad joke.
Eric: Eric pokes his head in to peek and go, “Boo!” I was gonna tell you January has a cute Palm Pilot. But, no, I'm booing you for your pun.
Julia (as Val): Adorable. Val does a little bow when January comes in.
Amanda (as Aggie): Aww.
Eric: That's incredible.
Julia (as Val): Because I still feel awkward about the way that they talked about them earlier.
Eric: Is this beautiful? January, I think just like bends an ear towards you. It’d be like, “Hmm. I acknowledge. Thank you. I appreciate that.” So, now, yeah, I think everyone here can see Tuna now.
Julia (as Val): Yay!
Amanda (as Aggie): Because Tuna trusted us enough that they'll let themselves be visible to us.
Eric: Yeah, I think like flour, but, also, science flour so everyone can see Tuna.
Amanda (as Aggie): Cool.
Julia: Can Val finally pet Tuna?
Eric: Oh, yeah, definitely.
Julia: Val, Val stops what they're doing. And, like, you know, when a cat is like walking towards you, and you just put your head down, and kind of bowed to it so that you'll get the little forehead bump? That's what Val does.
Amanda (as Aggie): So cute.
Brandon (as Milo): That's very good. And Tuna’s had – now, there's like, you know, three to four times the amount of people who can give him treats. So—
Eric: Exactly.
Brandon (as Milo): It’s a real win-win.
Julia: It’s very smart.
Eric: Exactly. It's both game mechanics and for Tuna. Wonderful. I guess. Yeah. Val, you're cooking it up. And I think Dr. Morrow has – I think she has a – she definitely has a favorite seat. Oh, yeah. She jumps up on the kitchen island and just like has her – her legs dangling down—
Amanda: Cute.
Julia: Hell, yeah.
Eric: – even though she's tall. She's like six feet tall. So, these are like a little bit higher kitchen counters.
Julia: Oh, no. Val needs to request a stool in order to cook.
Eric: Exactly.
Julia: Just a little step-stool so that they can reach, you know, without weird angles.
Amanda: I mean January probably has one somewhere.
Eric: You know – you know that there's like – there are pressure points around the kitchen where you put pressure on it, and then, like, it raises you up.
Amanda (as Aggie): Ooh.
Julia (as Val): (Gasp) I love that.
Eric: There's like an image on Tumblr where there was like a same-height party. Do you know what I'm talking about?
Brandon: What?
Julia: No.
Eric: Yeah, there's like this really old image on Tumblr that is always like bopped around and with screenshots. It was – it was—
Amanda: Gee, Campaign 2 really bringing different energy to the podcast.
Eric: It's like a same-height party. Like, everyone is six one and, like, you have to put on those stilt cups that you can just like tie to your feet so that everyone is the same height. So, it's kind of like that. It's like it recognizes how tall you are, and then raises you up to optimal height, because it's a science kitchen.
Brandon: Incredible
Julia: I love that. Cool.
Amanda: Cool. Just like the whole floor is hydraulics.
Eric: Yeah, everything is hydraulics. It's beautiful.
Julia: Thank you Science Kitchen!
Eric: So, yeah, Dr. Morrow, she reaches up and grabs one of the really big wine glasses and puts like 15 ounces in the 16-ounce glass. Like--
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): I know, you all didn't want to talk about the philosophy of everything here. But I guess – in my home, I guess I, I would love to tell you about the things that I care about. And I – things that I love to do to unwind. Yeah, I would – it would leave everything pretty ambiguous if we didn't talk about this a little bit. I am so happy that all of you have quickly came around, and wanted to clean up the city, and follow my vision, and you listened to the PowerPoint and all of that. But I guess the big question here is whether or not, for one reason or another, do we – do you want to be publicly out there with masks on or not publicly out there without masks on, but it is still – you see both of these are secrets in different ways. And it's kind of an interesting moral – more – it's an interesting and complex problem, which I just love to roll around – roll around with you here. You know, I can tell you about the – you know, the way that the public persona comes in and the reasons why you protect your family and how that might be better or worse for the city and as representative and all that. And I have my own thoughts, but I – you know, this can go either way, truly. I'm not trying to push you in any sort of idea. It's just an interesting question that I – we will have to answer and sooner rather than later. And, you know, doing it in a kitchen with greasy pasta at 11 at night just sounds like the best way possible.
Brandon (as Milo): Whoa. Whoa, Whoa. Greasy?
Julia (as Val): Yeah, excuse me.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): In a positive, positive way. If I positive—
Brandon (as Milo): Alright.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Cheesy, greasy, delicious. I love it. Mouth – the mouthfeel and the carbonara and, of course, I – Val.
Julia (as Val): It is – the silky is the word you’re looking for.
Eric: The silky, the unctuousness of the pasta. Sorry, I don't say unctuous in mixed company.
Julia (as Val): Nor should you.
Eric: So, hello, I'm DM Eric. I guess the here's the question. This is the crux of this, this episode, and the way that the podcast goes in two different ways. I think we do need to decide whether or not you want to be a superhero team and be the idea that we all have here of superheroes or not. And you can be the Strikeforce, but then there’s gonna be a lot of secrecy in a different way. In both ways, you are protecting your identity. But do you also have a public identity to make it easier for you to go do your stuff? Is ultimately the question here.
Julia: So, player Julia loves the idea of putting on a mask and getting to potentially have an action figure and whatnot. Val, I feel like will harder to convince of that. Mostly, because of the stuff that happened with the bank and all the social media stuff. So, their argument would be, “Well, a bunch of people saw me vibrating and punching people. So, if I'm vibrating and punching people but in a mask, what's to stop people from putting two and two together?
Amanda: Yeah, and I think, for Aggie sort of similarly, this is already her life. She already has reasons to be in a lot of these places and people already know her as somebody who can come in and fix stuff. And her powers too, being around healing and stuff that can kind of be explained away or downplayed, I think that a more kind of low key – you know, do these things under the veil of something else, a city appointment, a volunteer group, a task force, whatever it might be, seems simpler, because, yeah, how many, you know, six-foot-tall, like, red-haired, burly women are in Lake Town City?
Brandon: I think, for player Brandon, it would be most interesting to put Milo in a situation where he is unmasked. Because, obviously, that creates the most tension, especially with his job, and his father, and his father's job. But I think, for character Milo, he would be afraid to give up his job at the museum. And, like, he has to have money to support himself. How is he going to do that? And I think it's also just scary to be a public figure. You know, like, that type of public figure.
Eric: Yeah, I think – I definitely think that's fair. Dr. Morrow, also, alluded to the fact that she would pay you in some way. And I guess, necessarily, you wouldn't leave your jobs. It would – both of these would still require you to have your civilian lives in so many ways, because of the ways that, you know, your characters interact with the city itself and how plugged in the three of you are to different parts of the city.
Amanda: So, I guess if we were – if we had, you know, public mask personas, people could make appeals or write about some social or like tag us if they need our help. But, if we were more like people that got called in when something hinky is going down and it's mostly secret, then, you know, someone could potentially stop by the museum or historic lake town or the pizzeria to say something. But I'm assuming that, if Dr. Morrow is the kind of dispatcher here, she would be controlling most of the calling us to places or dealing with like inbound calls for help.
Eric: Yeah, for sure. Gotcha. All three of you make a history check for me.
[Dice Roll]
Amanda: 14.
Julia: I got 12.
Brandon: I got 17 + 3 for 20.
Julia: Dirty 20!
Eric: Okay. Brandon, with a dirty 20, you remember, last year, I guess like you and your friends as plugged in nerds to superherodom. You've heard like all those stories of people trying to be like city defenders. And it's really just like people in – who are good at karate and like, do CrossFit. And then they put spandex on, and they kind of jump around and punch people. But there was, like, two years ago, in Nashville, a guy who was running around as the Golden Knight, who has this public superhero. He had this glowing sword, and, like, rocket boots. He would hit them – he’d hit a button, and then his boots would turn into rollerblades. And he'd be able to like travel super fast. And, like, he cleaned up the city quite a lot and still kind of like a celebrity for a while there. And it's – you know, there was notoriety for like six months. You haven't really heard much about it. But you saw all the posts. Like, people were taking selfies with the Golden Knight. And they were like really beautiful photos of the Golden Knight, like, kicking butt. At some point, like a supervillain rose up, who was trying to destroy all the bridges and hold Nashville captive. And the Golden Knights defeated them. So, this has worked before. There's kind of like this isolated case. And it was goofy, but, now that you have all these ideas together, it definitely seems more real than what you thought.
Brandon (as Milo): Do you guys remember the, the Golden Knight?
Julia (as Val): Isn't that like a hockey team or something?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, they were named after the Golden Knight.
Julia (as Val): They named a hockey team after… what?
Brandon (as Milo): He was a superhero in Nashville. And then I explain the whole story.
Julia (as Val): Sounds like a nerd.
Amanda (as Aggie): Dr. Morrow, I-I guess the thing that would help me make this decision is would it be the three of us in contained unit doing something different or the Knight of Mirrors or whoever would be involved? Or is this- is this bigger? Is this wider? Are there a lot of people that you're tapping to help with certain problems and clean up certain issues?
Eric: (as Dr. Morrow): Hmm, that is a good question. Well, we've been preparing for something like this for a long time. Nothing has really happened before. You know, as we said before, we all know as people who've lived in this place for quite a long time and know people. It was quite a long time. People connected to the original Lake Town settlements. There is something going on. But, of course, a lot of other people don't know that. They just kind of wave it around. Oh, it's the weirdness of living in the 2020. Like, everything's happening. It's – it's who – who knows, you know. We've been preparing for something like this for a while, and we've reached out to some. I tried to get something like this going in the 90s. And I don't want to point any fingers, but that generation chose to do the things that they wanted to do that they thought were, were neat. I’m, also – you know, I was responsible for the city. We've tried other initiatives like this, and it didn't work out necessarily. I have this this plan, and you three seem to be the best fitting at the moment. I – you know, we, we reached out to Emily, and Emily had her own ideas. And it- it didn't work. Here – you know what? You know what might help is if – maybe if I showed you what some of the things that we've been working on.

Eric: Dr. Morrow takes out her phone and projects like a keypad up. And she pushes five, and she says, “Dez? Dez! you can come in now.” And you hear somebody walking in from a room down the hall. And, as this person rounds the corner, the first thing you see are two very large duffel bags. And then the next thing that you see is the metallic hand holding one of the duffel bags. And you look up and there is a scruffy looking dude with unfathomably long hair with a black bomber jacket, and just ripped jeans, and a dirty white t-shirt.
Julia (as Val): (Gasp).
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): And Dr. Morrow says, “Everybody, this is Dez. Dez has been working with me for a long time. And Dez is kind of our tinker. And, Dez, why don't you introduce yourself to – well, this is Val, and Milo, and Aggie.”
Eric (as Dez): And Dez says, (in a definitely smoked one too many cigarettes, raspy voice) “Yeah, I mean I got all these things if you want to check them out. I thought it was some cool stuff and the thing I've been working on for a while now. Anyway, just check it out.”
Brandon (as Milo): What?
Eric (as Dez): I got-
Julia (as Val): He said he's been working on them for a while now. And we should check them out.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, we can check them out, you know?
Brandon (as Milo): Hi, Dez. I'm down. I would love to see what you're working on.
Eric (as Dez): And I—
Amanda (as Aggie): Is one of Dez’s hands metal?
Eric: Yeah, his left arm I guess to his elbow, it's metal. It seems like, very well put together. I mean everything seems really articulated. You only saw him carry these duffel bags, and then put these duffel bags up on the kitchen island. But it seems like, incredibly well articulated, and like pretty freakin’ cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): So, like, uber awesome prosthetic.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, I just got some cool stuff in here. If you – I mean I don’t know. Is there a way you want? Which way – should I go this way and that way? And should I start with the thing that was more cool? And then go from the other end and just figure it out.
Julia (as Val): Start with the thing most cool!
Eric (as Dez): I mean I can go—
Brandon (as Milo): Start with the thing most cool.
Eric (as Dez): I'm gonna start with the thing that I think is the most cool, but I guess if there’s sort of process that I either want to go and think.
Amanda (as Aggie): No, this is your place of employment.
Julia (as Val): I feel like we trust your opinion.
Eric (as Dez): Uh, I appreciate – new friends, I appreciate it.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Dr. Morrow says, “Well, let's – maybe we should do it in – you can go from coolest to less cool, whatever that means to you.
Eric (as Dez): I mean I think that everything's just kind of really cool. It's more of the – I want to impress the new people.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well – well, let's, let's – hold on. We're doing a thing. Hold on. So, I guess the first thing is – one, is – let's call this superhero-y in one basket on this side. And the other side is more sneaky basket. One is which that you want to impress people, that we've been working on for a while, and maybe would go into this identity if you did want to create this persona that you care about. And it’d be something that would just help you in a more of a flashy sense that would make you look like righteous dudes. And then the other one is something more sneaky. If you need things to disappear or you need to do things on the low and sneaking around, we can do that. So, which would you like to see first?
Julia (as Val): Let's see the flashy stuff, it seems pretty cool. Val puts down the bowl of eggs and parmesan and black pepper that they've been whisking.
Brandon: Milo looks at it longingly.
Amanda (as Aggie): I whispered to January as we were leaving the other room for more whiskey. Is that – is that here yet?
Eric (as January): Yeah, January – January just hops on and be like, “Oh, yeah, I got you the good stuff.”
Amanda (as Aggie): Thanks. Thanks, man. Thanks, January.
Eric (as January): No problem.
Eric: And it's just fun watching a rabbit jump from a kitchen island and down to the floor. It's just delightful. So, let's think of these- kind of as your – the items you can all use together. And Dez pulls out a pack of gum, a contacts case, and just like the hilt of a sword.
Brandon (as Milo): These – these were the flashy things?
Amanda (as Aggie): Gum?
Eric (as Dez): I mean it's – I mean you got to kind of give it one – give it a second. Look at it. It's gonna be flashy when you look at it.
Julia (as Val): I mean y'all have seen James Bond before, right? I am not the only person in this room who has seen a James Bond or a spy movie?
Amanda (as Aggie): We did have a DVD of Spy Kids. Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Nope, never seen it.
Julia (as Val): Jesus!
Eric (as Dez): What about Spy Kids 2? Spy Kids 3D? No, that's outside of your purview.
Amanda (as Aggie): I was just kind of creeped out by those Fruit Loops. So—
Julia: Jesus!
(collective snickers)
Eric: So, yeah, Dez takes a pack of gum and shows it to all of you. And it says Winter Fresh on it. And Dez takes a thick stick of gum, and wraps it, and put it in his mouth, and then walks over to – in my head, this kitchen leads out to like – to the veranda one side. So, it opens-
Amanda (as Aggie): Very Nancy Myers.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia (as Val): Sure. Sure.
Amanda (as Aggie): White glossy curtains.
Julia (as Val): Oh, yeah.
Eric: Opens a screen door and blows. And then there's just like a cone of icy wind flowing out of his mouth. Talk about—
Julia (as Val): This is extremely cool!
Brandon (as Milo): That is very flashy, I like it very much!
Eric (Dr. Morrow): So, we could call this the Breath Weapon Gum. It gives you the opportunity to just blow. You know, we have a lot of different flavors here. This is just kind of the first one that we've – we've been tinkering with. It’s the Winter Fresh, but we have different flavors if – depending on what your thing is, if your electricity or fire or, I guess, poison. And that one might taste kind of disgusting. But we do have something there.
Eric (as Dez): And, also, it’s really good for your dental hygiene. Just this particular – I just thought it was something that I had to bring up.
Julia (as Val): Dental hygiene is very important Thank you, Dez.
Amanda (as Aggie): That's great. Dez, you just – your values are really aligned with our values, and we appreciate you.
Eric (as Dez): I mean, if your values doesn't include oral health, I don’t – if you don’t have chompers–
Amanda (as Aggie): What, what are we doing here? What are we doing here?
Eric (as Dez): What are we supposed to-- What are we doing here?
Eric: And then Dr. Morrow reaches for the contacts and puts them in. And she – it looks like she has no white part of her eye.
Amanda (as Aggie): No. No.
Eric: It’s just pupil. It might look like I am from the popular 90s store Hot Topic, but, in fact—
Amanda: Wait, Eric. I really need to know. Did Lake Town City ever have a Hot Topic?
Eric: A hundred percent!
Amada: Oh, good.
Julia: Had to.
Amanda: College town.
Eric: Where do you think all of the My Hero Academia heads in Lake Town City get their shirts? Listen, these are all – their modeled kind of off the Dailies. They do disintegrate after a little while, but you do – you are able to look better and scare people with these cool eyes.
Julia: That is very, very cool. I'm a fan of that.
Eric: And then Dez walks back over to the hilt. And you can see that he like tries – he smushes it. It's like a toy sword. It's like he smushes it down so it can fit kind of just in your pocket. And then he pulls it back out, and he presses a button, and then just like a very – a very chunky large sword just comes out of this. Like – like, it's a Buster Sword. Like, it is – it is so much bigger than the hilt. But it's this like yellowy Hard Light sword. And you see, like, Dez kind of just has one hand and kind of flicks it around in like a circle, and then throws it up like it's a baton and catches it. He’d be like—
Eric (as Dez): I can do those. It's just a cool thing I could do. It’s just a thing that I—
Julia (as Val): That's very cool, Dez.
Eric (as Dez): Thank you. I—
Brandon (as Milo): Emily's gonna be jealous of that.
Amanda (as Aggie): That is awesome.
Eric (Dr. Morrow): So, this is the hard light sword. It's very dangerous. And it’s truly as light. Any one of you can hold it. It does have very limited battery, unfortunately. We – you can't pop the battery. And you got to make a new one. So, just turn it off. It only has 50 seconds left and Dez still like whipping it around. He’s just like—
Eric (as Dez): Oh, sorry. I just kind of like that one.
Julia (as Val): I was like, “Can I try? Can I try? Hold on, hold on, hold on.”
Eric (as Dez): Umm. Sorry. I, you know, want to get into my baton tricks. You know, I went to Grambling State for a scholarship for baton.
Amanda (as Aggie): Dez, I need to know so much more about you.
Julia (as Val): The more I learn about you, the more I'm so fascinated.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, I like new friends. New friends are great.
Amanda (as Aggie): Let's definitely go to Astros this weekend.
Eric (as Dez): Oh, hell yeah. Which one? Like the good one – the one in Thornhill or like the Red Hook?
Brandon (as Milo): They're all good.
Eric (as Dez): I mean, you know, it's a slide. Of course, it’s a sliding scale. And I wouldn't say this anybody would didn’t live here like my friends from – like my friends for the West Coast, when they come, I'm not just like, “Oh, that's a bad Astros. They're all good Astros. But, like, you know, we all have preferences.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Okay. Look, can we stay on topic, please?
Eric: Alright. So, DM Eric. So, this is breath weapon gum. It's like a breath weapon from a dragon burn. And there are different flavors. You can choose your flavor. They are contacts. They expire after a minute then you get advantage on intimidation and investigation. And this is the hard light Buster Sword. It gives you a 2D 6+ Strength or Dex, whatever you're better at. But it does expire after a minute.
Julia: These are all extremely cool.
Eric: I will say, all the things here, they are “consumables.” So, you got to use them for the extended period of time. But then Dez just say—
Eric (as Dez): You know, like, if you need more, I do need some more parts stuff so we can work this out. But I can make them for you if – if the thing – if it's a thing. I will – you know, I’ll have to put some stuff together, but I’ll figure out – figure it out.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): We've been putting this together. Well, we had – you know, we haven't – you plan as much as you – without any actual data, like, how are you actually supposed to put the things together, you know.
Amanda (as Aggie): It's a test run. We get it.
Eric: Okay. So, now, the sneaky things. And Dez opens that up. First thing, Dez pulls out like a really long like Pyrex container. There’s like three – it's like three feet long, but like half a foot wide. And it's all just made out of Pyrex.
Amanda (as Aggie): Is this for marinating like a whole swordfish?
Brandon (as Milo): Oooh.
Eric: Yeah. That can – that’d be pretty neat. And, inside, you see that there's something like twinkling in there. He also pulls out what kind of looks like a regular-looking airhorn that you might find like, I guess, on a boat or, you know, a medkit or something. And then he pulls out a glasses case. It is actually – it's just a Warby Parker glasses case. He’d be like—
Eric (as Dez): Yeah, I just have a lot of these hanging around. Like, I'm not gonna make it – reuse, reduce recycle, you know what I mean?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): Does Dez wear glasses? This is important.
Eric (as Dez): You know, like, Aviators. Like, you know, all the time.
Julia (as Val): Of course you do.
Amanda (as Aggie): Everybody needs them at some point, nothing to be ashamed of.
Brandon (as Milo): Dez is the best.
Eric: Yeah. So, Dez pops open the Pyrex. And he holds what looks like a Neanderthal club.
Amanda: Like a Flintstones club.
Eric: Yeah, like a Flintstones club, but it's totally made out of ice. And he's holding in his metal arm.
Eric (as Dez): This is pretty cold. I should probably hold – like, I have a glove or something just in case.
Eric: And—
Brandon (as Milo): Why, why is it in Pyrex?
Eric (as Dez): It. is. cold.
Julia (as Val): Just to stress.
Eric (as Dez): Yeah.
Julia (as Val): Cold.
Eric (as Dez): It’s cold.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Dr. Morrow says, “Don't put this next to your Margarita mix or your chubby hubby. This is very dainty. It's very delicate. This Icicle Club, it's very good at dealing damage. But, immediately after you use it, it melts away.” Did you see The Lovely Bones? Do you know that book and movie? You know, The Lovely Bones?
Brandon (as Milo): No.
Amanda (as Aggie): This is not a reference I expected in this conversation.
Julia (as Val): No.
Eric: You should read The Lovely Bones. Stanley Tucci is in it. It's very good.
Julia: Stanley Tucci is in a book?
(Brandon laughing)
Eric: It was a while – Stanley Tucci was – in my head – I saw the movie first, and then I read the book. So, it felt like Stanley Tucci was in it. He's actually playing the bad guy. It's very sad, but the whole thing is that the murder weapon is an icicle. It's a whole thing.
Julia: Like that old riddle.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah, it's like the – like the riddle.
Julia: He stabbed him with an icicle then there’s no evidence.
Eric: Yeah.
Eric (as Dez): You know, there’s a table. And you cut it in half, and you put it together. And it's a whole – and you can escape. Or was that a different riddle?
Eric: No, I think—
Brandon: That's a different.
Eric: – that’s a different riddle.
Julia: I think that’s a different riddle.
Eric (Dr. Morrow): Dez, your riddle knowledge along with all the other knowledge is impeccable.
Amanda: I love this boss-employees supportive relationship.
Julia: So good.
Eric: So, then Dr. Morrow picks up the airhorn and blows it at Milo. And, Milo, you'll hear—
Brandon (as Milo): Well, okay, ow.
Eric: You hear an incredibly loud airhorn just blaring. It's like, uncomfortable how loud it is.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, like airhorns.
Eric: Yeah, like air horns, exactly. And she turns to everybody else and says—
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Now, did anyone else hear the airhorn?
Eric: And none of you did.
Amanda (as Aggie): Did, did you press it? Is the button broken? That happens sometimes with these.
Brandon (as Milo): What?
Julia (as Val): It – I don’t think it’s working.
Brandon (as Milo): No, it definitely is working.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Ah, see, that's how the silent alarm works. Now, I – this one had four. Now, it's down to three. But, if you pointed at a particular person who you can see, the way that the sonic – yeah, we could talk about Sonic mechanics and quantum theory, whatever we'd like. Different philosophical conversation. But you point it at someone, they are the only ones who can hear it.
Amanda (as Aggie): Cool.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): After three – after three charges here, it breaks. You'll have to get another one.
Eric: And, finally, Dez pops open the Warby Parker case. And there's just like a pair of pretty chunky Buddy Holly style coke bottle glasses.
Julia (as Val): Oh, man, Milo this would look great on you.
Brandon (as Milo): Those would look great on me, I think.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well, again, they're very – well, I guess, you seem like the kind of chap who wears glasses quite a lot. They're very delicate. You just run into the wall.
Brandon (as Milo): What does that mean?
Eric: You run to the wall once, and did they just break?
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Is, is that their power?
Julia (as Val): That is their power. Yeah, very delicate.
Eric: Their power. Yes. Their power is really great.
Brandon (as Milo): Do you imagine that I run into walls a lot?
Julia (as Val): You do kind of seem like the kind where you would, like, get scared and then you'd just turn and run into a wall accidentally.
Eric: Like, if you see ghost—
Brandon (as Milo): Okay. That is fair.
Eric: If you see a ghost that you weren't expecting.
Julia (as Val): You know, like a Scooby-Doo character.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, okay.
Eric: Luckily, this compels people on their deepest level that they never want to hit a guy in glasses.
Julia (as Val): Like I said, Milo, this is perfect for you!
Eric: Okay. So, the way that these work, the Icicle Club, you will still need to roll to hit. You can throw it or you can wield it just as a two-handed club. If you hit, this will do 20 damage no matter what.
Amanda: Whoa.
Eric: However, if you miss while wielding it, there is a chance that you swing wildly and hit the ground, and it shatters. Oh, if you miss while throwing it, it hits the ground, and it shatters. So, this is very, very delicate. But, if it connects, it automatically does 20 damage. The second one is the horn of silent alarm. It has three charges. Basically, if you point it at someone who you have seen within an hour and is still within like 500 feet, you blow it, and they – they are the only ones who hear it. So, you can see that—
Brandon: Is it always that loud in their head or—
Eric: It is always loud depending on how close you are to it. It will set – it will be hurtful, like, if you’re doing it five feet away from a person. And then this is the, “You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses.” Basically, the glasses cast the spell, Sanctuary, which you have to do a wisdom saving throw if you hit that person. But, if someone does hit you, they will hit you in the face and the glasses will break.
Amanda: Oh, nerts.
Brandon: So, this like deflects the – like, Sanctuary, this just like deflect the hit to another party member or it just doesn't hit?
Eric: Sanctuary is you are compelled to hit somebody else—
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: – other than the person wearing the glasses. But, if they do a wisdom saving throw, and if they overcome it, and if they hit you, the glasses will break.
Amanda: But, if they fail their wisdom saving throw, that they have to either choose a new target or they lose the attack.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Got it.
Amanda: Gotcha.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): You can see these items are made for different squads. So, one of them – one of the various things that we can help you here. If you do choose to go with the superhero public persona route, we can also help you with those, really start crafting, and figuring out what your idea of who you are could be and what would be best for the things that you want to accomplish out in Lake Town city. I, I don't (sigh) – you know, I, I don't want to push you one way or the other. But you would be doing a lot of good as a public persona in all these different ways.
Amanda (as Aggie): But wouldn't we then encourage anyone with one CrossFit class to decide to become one as well?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Well, that's a good question. I guess, if people saw what you can do and how much different that is than the regular person with a low BMI can do which, again, BMI, totally–
Amanda (as Aggie): It means nothing.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): It means totally nothing. But I guess the way that this works is, if you three do it, then they'll be like, “Ah, I can't have a Ghost Panther running around. I can't run through a solid wall and not be hurt. I can't jump 10 feet in a single bound if I need to.” You all get a text message, all three of your pockets they buzzed.
Julia: Val is handing out plates of carbonara as—
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, thank God.
Julia: – they reach for their phone.
Brandon (as Milo): I grab my phone and read it.
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: You see the group text with Emily. And, now, I guess you – there's a number you don't recognize, but I – you’re gonna assume it's Sour Anthony.
[Over the phone]
Eric (as Emily): Hey, how did your side of the, the plan go? Oh, we totally kicked some butt over at the back.
Julia (as Val): You know, not having to work with Emily and Sour Anthony would be quite a fucking blessing, wouldn't it?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, it would I think.
Amanda (as Aggie): I'd rather be on the side of government than under its nose.
Eric (as Dez): Now, who is Sour Anthony?
Julia (as Val): You don't want to know.
Amanda (as Aggie): I hope you never run across him.
Julia: Val pushes Dez a plate of carbonara.
Eric (as Dez): And why would it be named that? Would he willingly be a sour person? Is that his thing?
Brandon (as Milo): Yes.
Julia (as Val): Yes. Yes.
Amanda (as Aggie): He thinks his beer preferences are his identity and that really was his first sin.
Eric (as Dez): Oh, I hate that.
[Laughter]
Brandon (as Milo): Can we have like – like, you have to eat carbonara immediately. Otherwise, it doesn't – you know, it's not great. Can we have, like, five minutes to scarf some food down?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Yeah. And, you know, I'll – I'll go back. I have some stuff I have to go work on with Dez. I'll let you eat in peace. January, let's go back – let's go back to the study. I'm gonna get you – I'll make you a hot carrot juice just like you like it.
Amanda (as Aggie): Does – does he perk up? Does he? Yes.
Julia (as Val): It sounds gross.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Oh, he loves—
Julia (as Val): No.
Eric (as January): He’s, he’s, “Oh, yeah, carrot juice. I love them. Thank you. It's always – it's a little too tall for me to jump up from here. So, I really, like, want to have someone to help me with that. Thank you.”
Eric: Aggie, your phone starts – starts buzzing.
Amanda (as Aggie): I look at the screen.
Eric: Emily's calling you.
Amanda (as Aggie): Alright. Definitely, gonna let that ring out. Put it down on the chair next to me.
Julia (as Val): Val nods like, “Yes, excellent choice.”
Amanda (as Aggie): I guess, all things considered, I would rather be a hero than a spy. It's not what I came in here thinking I want to do, but I like to go to bed early. And, doing missions in the daytime versus the nighttime, that’s – that's a point of consideration.
Julia (as Val): That, that is fair. Bedtime is important.
Brandon: I think Milo – he is not showing this, but I think he is really hard-pressed to pass up the opportunity to become an actual superhero even with all the—
Julia: Can I roll insight on Milo?
Eric: Yeah. Yeah, roll insight on Milo.
[Dice Roll]
Julia (as Val): Oh, I got a two.
Brandon (as Milo): Haha.
Amanda (as Aggie): Milo loves your pasta.
Brandon (as Milo): That's just true.
Julia (as Val): Val is like, “I will give you the recipe if you're cool.”
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I'll be cool. I'll be super cool. And, so, Milo is like, “Yeah. Yeah. Staying up in the daytime, great idea. I think we could help a lot of people. You get a cool leather jacket, or a cooler leather jacket, Val. I think—
Julia (as Val): Excellent correction. Thank you for that.
Brandon (as Milo): You're welcome, of course. I think I'm leaning towards the cool stuff.
Julia (as Val): Yeah, I mean, like I said, I didn't think that I would want to be a nerd who dresses up in a costume. But I, also, cannot resist the idea of being able to do cool things and not have to pretend that I can't do cool things.
Amanda (as Aggie): That would be a relief.
Julia (as Val): No one is calling me Punerella or whatever the fuck we called it last time. Just for the record.
Brandon (as Milo): What about Captain Bufala?
Julia (as Val): No, I do not have the powers of a water buffalo.
Amanda (as Aggie): What pasta shaped best expresses the kind of hero you want to be?
Julia (as Val): We are not naming my superhero persona after any type of food.
Eric: DM Eric pokes his head on the window and says, “What about The Cheesy Defender?”
Julia (as Val): I hate everything.
Eric: Yeah, I want all of you to think of a memory of one of your characters. Milo, when did Milo – Milo fall in love with superheroes?
[Nostalgic type of music starts]
Brandon: When he was about, like, four or five-ish. You know, he – his father had been sort of like seeding it all along. He wasn't trying to hide anything from him. But he had the – a real conversation about being adopted for the first time. And, you know, as any child would, they sort of feel a loss of control. So, when he started reading comic books, he saw superheroes that were in total control of their lives and everything else. And, so, it really resonated with him.
Eric: I like that. Milo is like five years old and just has those overalls that only look cute on children below the age of 10. And your dad comes in with like a black suit and a black tie and white button-down shirt. He has like a pin that is a- an eagle holding a computer in one talon and like a shield in the other talon.
Julia: Cool logo
Amanda: Talented eagle.
Eric (as Milo’s dad): And he leans out and says, “Milo, you know, I wanted to share with you something that I thought you would you – you would like, because I know you haven't really like touched any of your other toys. And, like, that's – that's fine. You can – we're still figuring out what you – what you think – what's something you would like? You know, I think – you know, you've been reading really well lately. And I can't read Chicka Chicka Boom Boom one more time. It’s just too much. I'm gonna level with you, kid. I know what happens to all the letters now after the hundredth time. So, I wanted to give you this.”
Eric: It is like a children's sort of comic book called the Husky Kid. He looks like a Winter Husky. I think he has like bracers and boots on that are arctic wolf colored and shading. And he has like a cowl that has little ears and blue eyes. And he just kind of looks like a – like a 12-year-old kid.
Eric (as Milo’s dad): And he’s like, “Hey, I thought you'd like – he reminds me of you, because, you know, he was raised by wolves. And then he got adopted by somebody in – I guess they call it Halcyon City, where he's from. But he gets adopted, and he has a good – he – you know, they work out things together. And then he fights evil. And I thought you would like that. You know, I have – I found a whole bunch of these. It’s just one of 100. There are 100 of these. So, if you like it, you know, this is something maybe you'll – maybe you'd like.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, tha- thanks, thanks dad.
Amanda: Aww.
Eric (as Milo’s dad): We're not – I'm allergic to dogs, unfortunately. And, also, no, I want to level with you. I'm also allergic to dogs.
Brandon (as Milo): Good, good thing we have a cat.
Eric (as Milo’s dad): That's true. It's just – it's just the dogs’ fur. The cat is fine. I mean, listen, Tuna, I've had Tuna for 20 years, and it's not changing now.
Eric: Aggie, when was a time that you defended one of your siblings?
Amanda (as Aggie): Every winter, the Lake of Lake Town freezes over completely, usually, by January, but definitely by mid-February. And everybody's favorite day is a day that you're finally allowed to walk clear across the ice. And you can go from one shore to the other. You can walk from town, to your house, or from your friend's backyard to the ice cream parlor and not even go around. You can just go straight – in a straight line. And it is the most wonderful day where your parents that it says in the newspaper when it is safe to walk on. And then your parents would let you just go wild. So, I took the kids out on a walk across the lake the first day that we could. I was probably 10, and the ones who could walk came with me. And, by the time, we got to the – the opposite shore, it was warmer than anybody expected. And there were some kids just kind of roughhousing on the shore. And one of my siblings got their feet stuck just kind of in that marshy space, where it was a little bit thinner by the weeds and the rocks and all of that. And, so, I had to sort of fight off a couple old kids – middle schoolers – from town and kind of yank them back up off the ice and carry them the rest of the way home because one of the shoes is down to the lake. Mom wasn’t happy about that. But it was the first time that I realized something really bad could potentially happen to someone I cared about. And I didn't think, but I just kind of stepped in and did it.
Eric (as the teen): Yeah, there's like this 13-year-old, who comes up you – on you and be like, “Hey, we don't want any babies cramping our style. Just get out of here.
Amanda (as Aggie): Just go fight somewhere else. We're just going to town. We're just passing through.
Eric (as the teen): Oh, no, this is our spot. And we're not here to do whatever you want. We don't need any freakin baby kindergarteners here harshing all the fun stuff I have.
Eric: Make a charisma role for it.
Brandon (as Milo): She had a +6 for charisma when she was when she was younger.
Julia (as Val): She was so damn cute.
Amanda (as Aggie): I've 16 – 1.
Eric: 1 off, 15. So, I think the bullies are still like pushing up on you and telling you to go away. And, at one point, you just like hold up your hand used to be like, “Hey, like, stop.” And he then looks at you for a second. And, like, gawks at the, the, the twins. And he's like,
Eric (as the teen): “Okay, fine. It's just like stupid.’
Eric: What does it – what does it look like when you're able to convince someone to like stop bothering you?
Amanda (as Aggie): I've come to recognize it as an adult. My whole body kind of filling with adrenaline, and then it's like it leaves. And the force of that feeling sort of like dissipates what the other person is brewing inside them. I sort of picture it like a flame being extinguished with like foam. You know, like a fire extinguisher on a house fire. Like it just kind of like fizzles out, and the anger and the commitment to violence just sort of like sizzles.
Eric: I like that. It's like they’re – is it like Aggie-shaped?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, like a humanoid shape of somewhat transparent foam just kind of like settles all over them.
Eric: Yeah. And I think that they – it settles on this 13-year-old who's just like-
Eric (as the teen): “Fine. I'll just – I didn't want to throw snowballs at your dumb siblings anyway, and then just steps away.
Amanda (as Aggie): And then one kids boot is gone. The other one starts crying. Everyone starts crying. The rest of crying. I'm just like, (sighs) “Okay, guys, let's – let's get some ice cream.”
Eric: Alright. Hey, Val, when was the first time that you defended yourself?
Julia (as Val): It was a summer when they were staying with their dad, and New York kids are mean.
Eric: Yeah, New York City kids – the city kids are mean. Yeah.
Julia: And I don't think Val even remembers what the specific thing that they were arguing about or what, like, incited the incident. But they remember feeling just so mad, and they never felt that mad before. And it kind of just filled them like from the toes to the tip of their head with something hot and angry. And it almost hurt, in a way. And they realized they just couldn't stop shaking. And, when they pushed a kid off of them, the kid went way farther than anyone should probably go when they're pushed by a 12-year-old.
Eric (as Val’s Dad): You're just walking around. Your dad is like, “Oh, just like, (sigh), hey, just go get lost for a few hours. I got some stuff to do.” You’re just walking around. You're just getting a sandwich.
Julia (as Val): Yeah.
Eric: Are you wearing like a leather jacket yet?
Julia (as Val): Um, I don't think so. I think it's like a denim jacket and like some shorts. It’s like black shorts.
Eric: Do you have like band patches on it.
Julia (as Val): Yep.
Eric: Panic at the Disco patches.
Julia (as Val): Of course, obviously. And those like chunky skater shoes. You know what I mean?
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, yeah. Like—
Eric: Yeah, for sure.
Amanda (as Aggie): Very good.
Brandon: I like that.
Eric: Yeah. And I think like three kids just like come up to you. And it's – they’re high schoolers. And they're just like in tank tops. And they're just like looking for something to do, and they see the 12-year-old with like chunky boots. And they’re like-
Eric (as mean kid): “Hey, oh – hey, oh, wait a second. I'm gonna – I want to see – take a look at your patches. I want to take a look at the patches on your – take a look at your patches on your jacket.
Julia (as Val): I'm just walking here.
Eric (as mean kid): No, I just think—
Julia (as Val): Leave me alone.
Eric (as mean kid): No, I think it's cool. I just want to see you patches, patches on your jacket. Why wouldn't you show? Don’t you want to show it to me?
Eric: And, like, they surround you and just like start pulling on your jacket in a way that you don’t like.
Julia: Val kind of throws a couple of elbows like they've been taught. And it doesn't really work at first. And I imagine like the kids trying to pull the jacket off of them, and that's what really starts pissing them off.
Eric: Yeah, make an attack roll for me.
Julia (as Val): Okay. So, that, with rage, is 17.
Eric: Yeah. Oh yeah. Here's the thing. A tank top wearing West Village kid has a low AC.
Julia (as Val): Good.
Eric: You like hit him just right in the chest, and you just like go back like 10 feet. It's like they're almost like sliding on the pavement. Like, their sneakers are burning into there and just like skidding back 10 feet just to push them off you. Like-
Eric (as mean kid): What – Hey, I just want to look at your jacket. What the hell? What the fuck?
Julia (as Val): Don't mess with me.
Eric (as mean kid): Alright. Fine, Geez you just told me you didn't want to touch it. Fine. Fuck you.
Julia: Hey, hey, fuck you.
Eric (as mean kid): Hey, fuck you.
Eric: Alright. I think the three of you are sitting down eating this carbonara at Dr. Morrow's table, you're feeling all these memories as you're eating the pasta and talking about them with each other. And you – It feels right. Like, you've always been people who can defend yourself and defend others and want everyone to feel wanted. And suddenly there that you have an opportunity to do it. And it feels – it feels good. It feels like, all of a sudden, something snaps into place and be like, “Oh, this is the track. This is what I'm doing.” And you feel warm inside, and it's only a little bit from the carbonara”
Julia: It’s a lot of it from the Carbonara, but okay.
Eric: Dr. Morrow and Dez and January come back in and be like-
[Heroic Music Starts]
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): “So, did you – did you all decide on anything?
Amanda (as Aggie): We're ready to be heroes.
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Dr. Morrow says, “Well, at the risk of having to get down to business, she's holding one of those like architecture containers that have maps in it. She puts it on the table, pops out a map, and lays it out. And it – it’s like a blueprint of the Lake Town District as a whole, but there's something below it. There's an entire structure that is below Lake Town.
Amanda (as Aggie): Whoa, these aren’t – these aren't sewers, are they?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): No. This is where the nephews actually hang out.

Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello, and welcome to the After Party where we have as many questions about ice cream trucks as I think we did about Tuna last episode so I'm very excited!
Julia: A lot of ice cream trucks! They're very important in these episodes.
Brandon: Ice cream trucks, the new fan favorite! [laughing]
Amanda: We also started a very important discourse about soft-serve ice cream trucks, and the fact that those are very localized, regionalized, there's just lots ice cream discussion happening here.
Eric: Brandon learned what a boathouse was, we all grew.
Julia: Congratulations!
Amanda: Many architectural reference images, it was very fun for me.
Eric: That's true, it was nice to know that as we learned that it was not some Kennedy bullshit as Brandon described it.
Brandon: Did I?
Eric: Yes you did!
Brandon: That's pretty good, I like that!
Amanda: Let's start out with the fight that took up most of episode six I know Julia you had some questions about the mechanics of the fight.
Julia: Hey Eric, why why was he able to keep putting guys in front of him, and I couldn't hit him?
Eric: Well Julia, it's cause you're bad at Dungeons and Dragons—
Julia: Hey! No!
Eric: I've looked at the DM’s guide, and that's what it said! Uh, no, the reason why is I went into my bag of tricks and went into the monster a day wonderful compendium, and I found this little guy called the goblin boss. It's usually a goblin person but this was just a regular person now. It was just a challenge one and I have this wonderful ability called redirect attack when a creature the goblin can see targets it with attack the goblin chooses another goblin and within five feet of it the two goblins swap places and the chosen goblin becomes the target instead. Now what I did for this was ruffian boys replace the word goblin so in this fight I had goblin boss as Mantis they were the rat-faced one who talks like [in annoying teenager voice] this yeah I'm gonna get you [normal voice] and the very large high schoolers as I described them were boars.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So I did three boars, and then a goblin boss.
Amanda: Is there a mentor pegs joke to be made here?
Julia: Probably.
Eric: Yeah definitely, you insert your own.
Brandon: Fighting boars is much better than fighting underaged teenagers, so yeah I'm gonna go with boars.
Julia: Okay cool, cool, cool, we did punch a lot—
Eric: Just cause you're 15, doesn't mean you can't get beat up by the heroes coming in, I'm sorry.
Brandon: That's true it's true that's— that was my favorite Superman comic growing up.
Eric: Yeah where he beats up teens!
Amanda: Are there any kind of pact dynamics at play among them? Or was that swapping ability the sort of main mechanic?
Brandon: Because that's what you used in the bank scene right? Was it the bank scene?
Julia: Yes!
Brandon: When you used pack dynamics?
Eric: Yeah that was when I made the guys in the bank as kobold, but I didn't have a pack dynamic thing here that's it was more the boars had a charge move much like Val does, which I was not able to deal with there, because you just kept pushing them over—
Julia: Ah hah!
Eric: And it's like ah they're not able to run but Aggie is using her way of movement to use everyone's energy against them. You just did a lot of pushing people over so he couldn't run at you and charted you and tackle you which is what I really wanted to.
Amanda: Woo! Not violence is the answer!
Eric: Oh no, it was still violence when you think about it. Still violence.
Amanda: That's true.
Eric: Yeah that was all that was happening with that fight honestly, I thought that it was gonna be like Aggie getting beaten down, while Val and Milo figured it out outside. But you were just able to take care of business, and you kind of progressed it from the inside.
Amanda: I tried, I tried but speaking of Val and Milo how did that noticing of River play out?
Julia: Yeah let's talk about that perception roll.
Eric: Again bad at Dungeons and Dragons. So I kind of just made it a reverse perception roll like it was a trap, so obviously it was being distracted by somebody else your perception it's kind of when you look at things but I think there is a way to be distracted by important things so I kind of turn that on its head.
Brandon: Oh I love that! That's awesome!
Eric: The wonderful thing about this and again Julia you're just wrapping up your own demise here, you were the one who described college students going to Lake Town and looking for Monty in the world-building episodes, and this was when the world-building episodes came out so I was listening to it I'm like “that's a really good idea!” [keyboard clicking noises] and I put that in. So they were wearing lanyards and you know the only people who wear lanyards are the beginning of school year freshman, because it's fall. So they were doing the traditional rite of passage which is trying to find Monty in the woods which is why the what they were doing in the forest.
Amanda: I am sensing a crossover opportunity here with someone writing in to Spirits about the lore of Laketown City.
Eric: Well I would have that! I can go into that, that’s for sure.
Brandon: I have major concerns about these college students searching for an aquatic creature in the forest.
Eric: Wow Brandon doesn't want children being beat up he doesn’t want eighteen year olds looking for monsters. Such safetyism, ugh such a snowflake!
Amanda: Ahh god, not allowed on our social justice warrior podcast.
Eric: We don't have that class, I'm sorry.
Amanda: Aw damn.
Eric: Val is a social justice barbarian.
Julia: That’s true.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: The other thing that we didn't talk about was how you were gonna get into the garage so there was a padlock, I had found a PDF that I really liked about locks and keys that just like every lock needs a key, you can't just have a locked door. So I'm like okay if they're gonna lock this garage which has a giant mountain lobster in it, there has to be a key somewhere it might be on a person or they might have hidden it. So I was thinking about how smart these guys are so they're not, so they probably would have just hidden it around and I thought about this for a little while so it was under there was like a— [Eric pauses and laughs]
Brandon: Julia—
Julia: Was it under a rock or something?
Eric: It was under a rock yeah,
Julia: Ugh god damn.
Eric: I think it was like either under a rock and on the beach so under like a chair, there might have been a beach chair nearby I can't remember exactly what it was because you guys didn't do it, so I just kind of forgot about it but there was the key nearby.
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: You know when you overthink things and then you realize that you overthink them and that is the worst feeling?
Eric: The thing is you could have broken it! That's what Val tried to do in episode six you tried to break it but you missed, you just whiffed it and you weren't able to break the lock I was waiting for you to pick it back up but try to kind of destroy it.
Julia: I was like well this isn't gonna work! And moved on.
Amanda: It's like that's the first lesson I learned in D&D I think like episode 1 of campaign 1, I tried lock-picking completely biffed it and then didn't try it again and then in the after party I think someone said like I could have done it again. I was like oh shit so I always I always tried twice now.
Julia: Smart.
Brandon: Eric what would have happened if we had made the other decision so we had the choice between scouting the clubhouse, and the jailbreak what would have happened if we had chosen the jailbreak?
Eric: You know that's a good question because I was going to plan that when I got ready for episode six so I laid it out for you and then I'm like alright I'm gonna do some introductory stuff, and just lead them to whatever the thing they had to do. I kind of just made all that stuff up when you went to Aggies house for tacos. I'm like alright you approach the boathouse and then some stuff happens, and I kind of just made that bond they'll fly and then backfilled that for episode six. So it would have been some sort of jailbreak, now that you have foiled it, the plan was that there was going to be two ice cream trucks coming from Laketown and then there was another ice cream truck that was coming from a different place, which was the one that ran over Val a few episodes ago. That was going to try to do the jailbreak and they were all gonna converge and use their tech to just try to blow a hole in the side. But the problem was in all of these places there wasn't enough people to help the jailbreak to happen so there was supposed to be like six people on the job to spring for but of course it didn't happen because you guys defeated all these people the other thing that didn't happen was that Val was able to corral the ice-cream truck before anything bad happen. So like I had a whole chase scene set up for eventually when they got in the open road, the Knight of Mirrors was supposed to grab one of you, and you were gonna have like a vehicle battle. I had chase mechanics lined up—
Amanda: That's good!
Eric: So you all take care of it before all this happened so that's why the Knight of Mirrors picked up River Greens and was able to prove that you were knew what you were doing and this was a criminal enterprise.
Julia: No chase scene for you! No chase scene.
Brandon: Bow when you say Knight or Mirrors picked one of us up, is that like an evil thing or a nice thing—
Julia: Sexually.
Amanda: Or ally in battle?
Eric: Listen, Knight of Mirrors is a mysterious person—
Amanda: Guys we can't cut to spoily corner yet, that’s at the end of the episode.
Brandon: That's fair, that’s fair!
Eric: But yeah I also I did have stats for the very large mountain lobster just in case.
Julia: Just in case we had to fight them.
Amanda: Tell us about them! What did Tuna say? What happened?!
Brandon: Yeah what happened?
Eric: Oh Brandon, I should ask you!
Brandon: I mean I rolled poorly but—
Eric: As always what was going through your head when you were like “I know I'll send my cat who doesn't like people to go deal with this interesting creature!”
Brandon: Well my thought process was one Tuna doesn't like people but Tuna may like other animals I don't know I don't know to do that well, and two, I figured that Tuna would might have a better chance speaking to another animal than I would, but now that I'm thinking of the fact that humans are also animals. I think that that logic was kind of lost.
Julia: Hey remember how Brandon's our druid?
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: He can talk to ghosts he can't talk to living things.
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: I imagine Tuna was like, I don't know there's something about their favorite pastime is picking goldfish out of a fishbowl or something.
Julia: That's very threatening.
Brandon: Eric’s just looking at me.
Eric: Listen the dice also had some questions about that. I gave you the nat 1. Yeah man I mean there was a question that was like what would happen if Tuna didn't have a nat one. I'm like, I wish you could have told you, well what Tuna was doing, communicating and then Tuna swiped at it, and then it responded in kind and broke its above-ground pool. I don't know!
Brandon: So anyone who's a Tuna fan out there, I just want you guys to take this moment to realize that you're wrong, and Tuna’s bad.
Julia: Don't tell the audience that they're wrong to love Tuna.
Brandon: [laughing] I'm kidding, Tuna is fine.
Julia: Not good, fine.
Eric: [laughing] Man if only the person who had created Tuna had not created Tuna to make Brandon's life so it's easier. Let's go beat up that guy.
Brandon: Only if he’s under eighteen.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: [laughing] We only beat up minors here! I did look up, and people were making fun of me for how the mountain lobster communicated. I looked it up and shrimp, all shrimp in that area that phylum communicates by blowing really powerful and you know relatively powerful air into the water that creates bubbles. If a mountain lobster was going to talk, it was gonna just be “blbmblbmblmb!”
Brandon: I didn't second-guess that for a second.
Julia: No I thought it was right.
Amanda: I thought it was very charming and real.
Eric: There's a lot of animal research that goes into planning this. I also found this video that is a crawfish place asking what crawfish calls are, and it is the most lo-fi ridiculous video I've ever seen in my life.
Julia and Brandon: Oh my god oh my god.
Eric: [Laughing] Here's just a little clip of it.
Brandon: Thank you!
Man in YouTube Video: What are we doing right now?
Woman in YouTube Video: I’m doing a call for them.
Man in Video: Okay, let’s do it!
[Bubbling noises]
Amanda: Incredible.
Woman in Video: Get over here now!
Man in Video: How often does that work?
Woman in Video: You know, I’m really not sure, that was just a first hand look, we’ll find out later.
[Amanda and Brandon laughing
Amanda: Incredible.
Eric: It goes on for a minute and twelve seconds. I think it was a radio station that was hosting a crawfish boil, and they were doing this to promote it and like this is from like 2006 or they've put it on YouTube it
Amanda: That person looks exactly like Angela Merkel.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Wild.
Brandon: This is what she was doing before she was Prime Minister.
Amanda: I looked over and I was like “why do you have a video of Angela Merkel? Does she have a lot of opinions about Lake Town City or crawfish?”
Julia: She does, she's the Crawfish Queen.
Eric: She's Chancellor—
Julia. Chancellor Crawfish.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Well let us now get into episode specific questions from everyone. I actually have one for episode 5. Can we hear more about Milo and Lucas's friendship please? It's very pure.
Julia: Yes please! It’s so cute!
Brandon: Yeah I mean Eric, you gotta weigh in on this one too. I think when we were prepping it Milo I had like a cadre of like four or five friends at the Museum, but I think all I gave to Eric was like that, and like they're probably like a researcher and like an archivist and like people behind the scenes cause I think Milo's the only real like edu-edutainmenter.
Julia: Edutainer.
Brandon: Yeah thank you, at the Museum so I don't know. Yeah what was going through your head Eric?
Eric: Well I have these things written down that happened from conversations that I have with Brandon. So Lucas is one of three or four people that are part of the museum and they're all friends, they're all in a bowling league, Milo and Lucas do amateur rocketry together.
Julia: Oh my god adorable.
Eric: They have TV show watch parties and they're out everyone is into Douglas Adams and then I have like four if there are four friends here I have the archetypes that there is a mom, a really smart guy, the newbie, and the steady friend. What I had for Milo was he was the newbie because he what we talked about was the most recent recent addition to the museum team, and Lucas is just like a steady guy he's very chill he just kind of deals with what happens in front of him, and Milo as we've established his run into work very late every single time that we've had him go to work, so we haven't been able to see it other people. I really want to flesh out this friend group. I kind of have a very strong idea of who they are but we haven't had a chance to like build them out, so hopefully we'll get there so we have to out of these four friends.
Brandon: I'm excited I forgot that we had a bowling league. We should practice probably. We probably have a tournament coming up.
Eric: Didn't you say that you had your own bowling ball in episode one.
Brandon: 100% yeah.
Julia: You just forgot you had friends as part of your bowling league.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: I'm glad you built yourself a friend group that's that's really important Brandon.
Brandon: Well you know, there's a lesson there Julia. If you can’t make friends in real life, you can build your own friend group in D&D!
Amanda: And when your parents are not mob bosses in real life, D&D is an option for you Julia tell us please about Val's dad.
Julia: I mean I don't want to get too too spoilery but we did talk about he's a capo for one of the New York families, and Val’s mom and he separated around— do we establish before or after the incident?
Eric: They separated after because Val’s mom went up there to chill to chillax but they were on and off after they divorced.
Julia: Right—
Eric: Or they didn't divorce they were just separated because he can't get separated in the Catholic Church.
Julia: Can’t divorce—
Eric: It’s explicitly what you told me—
Amanda: I mean you can, but should you.
Eric: But like can you really?
Julia: Not—
Eric: Are your spirits ever separated?
Julia: Exactly.
Eric: In the eyes of Jesus—
Julia: And the Lord? But yeah I have a family tree that I've given Eric, and we've talked about the family tree a bit I don't want to like spoil too much because I'm sure we'll meet at least some of Val's family in the future, but there's a complex family network there.
Brandon: God I want to see that tree so bad.
Eric: Oh I'll send it to you don't worry about it.
Julia: Yeah!
Eric: It's also fun because I don't have to come up with the names and Julia calling her dad's Mob nicknamed “The Macaroni” is incredibly good for me.
Julia: You’re welcome!
Amanda: Very good, I laugh every time I hear or think about it.
Julia: It's very good there's other very good nicknames in that family tree as well just saying.
Eric: Oh there’s definitely more —
Brandon: Are they all pasta?
Julia: No, they’re not all pasta.
Brandon: [laughing] Okay.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: The other thing is that like we know a lot like we know a lot about Val's family we also have Val's aunt that has the sight—
Julia: I totally forgot about all that.
Eric: But yeah this totally fits into the world building that we did there is some sort of mob contingent in Little Italy in Laketown City, because everything that we talked about with the river and the docks and the building out of Laketown City. But Val's dad is in New York City and there is a connection between New York City and Lake Town city we established with a high speed rail and all that stuff New York State blah blah blah. But it's it's interesting seeing these two things come together and how different organized-crime can be in two different cities or at least like it's organized in incredibly regionally like they're not talking to each other they're not branches of the same office.
Julia: Right, they're not the same family, they're not branches from the main family they are separate entities.
Eric: Exactly so [his voice gets high pitched] uuuuhh who can say?
Brandon: In our fantasy universe is the pizza better in New York City or in LTC?
Julia: The pizza’s better in New York but also it's a different style of pizza, so.
Eric: Okay, yeah this is like when we went to New Haven.
Julia: Yes!
Eric: This was funny this was when we were where are we coming from?
Julia: Boston—
Amanda: Sound education,
Eric: Oh right we were coming back from Boston— remember when we took road trips? And Amanda flew to Atlanta for like 16 hours, so we drive—
AmandA: It was like four hours—
Eric: The drive back was me and me Julia and Brandon and we're like we're stopping in New Haven and we're getting this pizza!
Julia: I'm just real— I was personally really hungover and it was like I need pizza, real bad guys.
Brandon: It was really good pizza, pizza’s delicious.
Julia: Yeah Peppe's in New Haven go check it out.
Eric: It was so good like, I usually detest waiting on lines but this was totally worth it. Also the parking and New Haven blows so they'd be back together. There's too many one-way streets in New Haven.
Julia: There are!
Eric: That’s my hot take.
Julia: It's bad, it's bad parking, they should have like I don't know a municipal parking lot probably near that but what do I know?
Brandon: Should really just be Pepe's and then just an all parking lot the rest of it—
Julia: Yeah the rest of the town.
Eric: Or maybe—
Julia: Fuck y’all.
Eric: Or maybe maybe if the country was less car-centric, maybe we wouldn't have this problem. We’d get off the high speed rail and right into Pepe’s, then get back on.
Amanda: I was just fantasising about the fact that there are definitely like regional pizza crawls based in New York City that just like go up to the Lake Town for the afternoon to get pizza and like go back and it's not a big deal because there's fucking infrastructure.
Eric: Well there's probably a stop in Albany on the way up too.
Julia: Probably.
Eric: So like you go New York City and then Albany is in the middle and you can get like a giant Italian sandwich to eat on the train just like everyone it's like two feet and you cut it into twenty four pieces and you give it to give a slice to everybody and then you eat that on the train as you go off to LTC.
Amanda: Sweet.
Julia: Oh hold on now I need to Google if my sandwich shop is gonna be open after we're done recording, one second real quick!
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda: Joey asked about my nat one on the investigation check in episode five about learning more about The Nephews.
[Eric laughing maniacally]
Amanda: Asking why I didn’t use a luck point, which is a good point. But in this case I was worried about preserving them for combat. I feel like I've been watching so much to Dimension 20 where the combat is super high stakes and people actually die, that I was just really worried about saving that for a pivotal role in a combat scenario so you know if I had gotten more expositore stuff on The Nephews, then that's great; but I feel like I'd rather in a pinch have the ability to you know fix something or defend somebody in a fight. If I do it again I don't know maybe I would consider but that was my logic at the time.
Julia: I will say that nat one gave us the best interaction I think of that entire episode, which was you facetiming your sister trying to figure out why the toilet was clogged.
Amanda: Yeah it was so delightful to play and it was just it was wonderful I don't know where Eric pulled that from but it was perfect and I was it went on longer than the edit. Because Brandon made me sound very succinct to me edit but the phone call was a lot of like “I don't know like, where is it? What do you mean?” and it was extremely good.
Eric: Hey, none of your siblings listen this podcast right?
Amanda: Some of them do, but listen everybody has somebody who calls them with questions that they could Google. This is mine.
Eric: Again, you have all given me such gifts by building out part of your backstory and like there are a lot of people who we haven't met yet, not only because in episode 6 like I feel like we meet a ton of people as we look towards the future this entire arc is about meeting people and populating the world. But we’re slowly meeting more and more of your siblings and this was a perfect opportunity to do it.
Amanda: Yeah Joey also asked about what Quinn does and if they’re still a student what they're majoring in a bunch of just like world building questions about Quinn and I kind of don't want to answer because I sort of want that to happen in the fiction.
Brandon: I love that.
Amanda: Is that bad of me? Quinn is the theater actor, she's like a combo of Saoirse Ronan and like Tavi Gevinson, and has definitely like been in this apartment before.
Brandon: What number you and the siblings again?
Amanda: Number one.
Julia: Number one baybeeee!
Amanda: Number one.
Brandon: Oh you're the oldest.
Amanda: Yes, I am.
Brandon: Oof, cool.
Eric: Hey what are the names of all the siblings?
Amanda: [Matter of factly] Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn.
Eric: Okay sorry I've missed it the first time can you say that again?
Amanda: Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn. Is that a better emphasis?
Eric: Oh thank you now I understand.
Amanda: You just you gotta you gotta or else it won't come out the right way.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Alright n to episode six Ellie Paige would really like to know does the Knight of Mirrors reflect like a disco ball?
Brandon: I think yes
Eric: [with a wheezy laugh] I mean probably yeah it's — I wish I had some sort of comp here, but so imagine a medieval knight’s suit but then like break all of them off so that they all fit onto a football uniform so imagine each one was like a different piece that all kind of came together and you had to tape them onto a football uniform, so they all are surfaces. You know like it's not pieces of clothing these are like surfaces on top of pieces of clothing. So the answer to that by being just disparate mirrors is yes.
Julia: A large panel disco ball basically.
Eric: If you catch it at the right light and you just happen to have like some gels and some spotlights just hit em with it.
Brandon: They're really popular in the underground disco scene.
Eric: Who knows what the Knight of Mirrors is, I heard that the Knight of Mirrors was Chad.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: That’s my headcanon so.
Brandon: I really hope that the mirrors are actually literally just scotch taped on that would make me very happy.
Julia: They seem like they have their shit together though.
Amanda: Yeah I mean their bike is a serious tech.
Eric: I think there might be something in between the two, like you can have high tech but also you're an independent vigilante. Like hey this is might surprise you but most vigilantes are not Batman you don't have a billion dollars. A billion— a trillion dollars whatever we've come to you how much Bruce Wayne's net worth is. So I think there is a certain amount of like literally strapping some some reflective things and chrome on to what is seemingly a football you know.
Brandon: Do y’all ever wish that Bill Gates was a vigilante?
Julia: A little bit, but I feel like—
Eric: He is a vigilante for malaria.
Amanda: He's a public health vigilante yes. Love it.
Julia: There we go.
Amanda: and Melinda, don't forget it’s a dynamic duo nothing's easy in this world. Except for maybe punching ice cream trucks, Kae would like to know: Julia is Val developing a sort of negative reaction to the presence of ice cream trucks in general?
[Eric laughing]
Julia: I will say, I'm really glad that we're in fall and hopefully going into winter next. BBut if it was summer and it was peak ice cream truck season I think that maybe, possibly there would have been some sort of complex.
Brandon: I do like to imagine that Julia wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night just like bolts up from her sleep sweating, and just imagines the Mr. Softee ingle in her head.
Julia: Yeah, that's how my brain usually works.
Eric: The studio is at the end of the road like there's a dead end that leads to a park and I don't know why it is but for like a few weeks earlier the ice cream trucks would just sit in the dead end and just play the song for like 20 minutes. It's like they were on break but also running the music?
Brandon: That seems like illegal activities are happening.
Eric: You think? It doesn't seem illegal, it's just terrible.
Julia: They're also near a park so they're probably hoping that people from the park will come and get ice cream.
Amanda: I also don't know how prudent it is to be operating an ice cream truck mid-Coronba. So there's just many questions to be had.
Brandon: Yesm many questions.
Amanda: Well we will get into our general show questions and of course the spoily corner in a moment but speaking of vigilantes, and heroes, and Batman. I would love to talk a little bit about a new item that we have for sale in the merch store.
[Brandon gasps]
Brandon: What is it!
Eric: Oh wow! What is it?
Amanda: It's No Capes! A D&D reskinning and superhero guide by Eric!
Brandon: That sounds so good!
Eric: Ahh! It’s me!
Brandon: I would pay $100,000 for that!
Eric: Well Brandon, I'll tell you it's not that much, it's actually just $12.
Julia: Woah!
Brandon: That’s a bargain!
Amanda: It’s 50 pages! That’s so long!
Eric: That’s true! This is a 50-page guy that I pulled together of everything that we've been doing in Join the Party Campaign Two - there's a lot of ideas about reskinning, and how to take the game mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons, and take away that high fantasy stuff on it and the turning it into whatever genre you want! In this case superheroes there's a lot of writing about this I kind of break down every single class into like its game mechanic components which is good for both DMs, old players, and new players alike.
Amanda: Yeah I wish I could have read that when I first started playing because I feel like I had no understanding of how the caster classes deferred, and the little like tagline that you wrote for each of the classes just like made it all clear to me it's like I saw God. It's like “oh my god, yes finally, this!”
Eric: Thank you—
Brandon: And isn't God worth $100,000?
Eric: No Brandon, it's just $12!
Amanda: Just $12!
Eric: But don't worry I have written some new and original stuff that you can put into your game regardless, I have seven different new subclasses, and like two pages worth of consumable items you can use, and I've also edited and published RPG city planner which we talked about which was the game that we use to turn Lake Town in 1985 into Lake Town City in 202X. So I poured a lot of energy and time into this and it's really exciting and I really would love to share with you. I think it's pretty neat and check it out! Oh! You all, Brandon also thinks it's neat!
Brandon: I think it's worth $100,000!
Amanda: Wowie!
Eric: But you can get it for just $12!
Brandon: No I think it honestly it's really cool, my favorite thing about D&D in general this is reskinning, and I haven't seen personally quite a like clear cut guide before. Like Amanda was saying it is like super easy to use and it makes things so much more approachable. And yeah I really like it.
Julia: Yeah some of those subclasses are so cool like genuinely I want to start a campaign with those subclasses, and just like, you know be stretchy and punch guys and stuff like that.
Eric: That's true I can tell you what the subclasses are. So I made a subclass for a bunch of different classes for the artificer, I made Mission Control which is kind of like the Oracle, some either it is like a man in the chair or the man in the van sort of type where you stay outside and you send information, and tech in. Or you're like just doing general support using the tech that you have I have put together a Mylo circle of spirits. The fighter is the pro hero fighter, so think like My Hero Academia, the professional hero using your charisma and your love of the audience to help out your team and to do more damage. The monk is the way of the stretch, so it's—
Amanda: ELASTIGIRL!
Eric: It's like Elastigirl, Mr. Fantastic turning yourself into different objects that can help you during your monk fighting. The rogue is the spacewalker which you can't ™ because this is a podcast, it's just Nightcrawler.
Julia: It’s very cool that it’s Nightcrawler.
Eric: The sorcerer is the Shocking Soul so something like Static Shock like paired with the technology there, like how do you have a superhero that uses the electricity of a modern world to your advantage, and finally the wizard is the chronomancer. I took a different stab at this looking at time like it was a story like being able to look forward and backwards at the roles that you can do, and remember you are telling a story in Dungeons and Dragons so the chronomancer has more control over that than a regular player was. You can even take narrative control away from the dungeon master.
Brandon: Absolutely.
Amanda: That is so delicious.
Julia: That is very very cool.
Eric: I think it's pretty neat.
Brandon: I would pay $40 for that Eric.
Julia: Woah!
Eric: Well Brandon, it’s only $12! You're getting closer to the price point!
Amanda: You can buy it four times I guess, that'll be pretty nice. But yeah that along with our digital merch, along with our Lake Town City Mountain Lobster t-shirt, hat, and poster by Squared are all available on jointhepartypod.com/merch.
Brandon: Every time I look at that poster, I'm amazed by it again it's so good.
Julia: It is very very cool.
Amanda: Well, let us take a quick break to head back to the kitchen and fill back up our trail mix bowls, it's custom blend™™ mine only.
Julia: Ooo.
Brandon: None of those weird garlic chips or whatever.
Amanda: No garlic chips!
Julia: No garlic for Amanda.
Amanda: Not for me! Alrighty see you in a sec
[Transition note]
Hey, it’s Amanda,

Next, I want to recommend a wonderful podcast for you to listen to once you catch up on JTP: Hey Riddle Riddle. Every week, Adal Rifai, John Patrick Coan, and Erin Keif get together to play and unpack puzzles and riddles. The three Chicago-based improvisers tackle any sort of brain-teasers or head-scratcher imaginable. Some are impossible, some are absolutely improbable, and some often seem not quite of this time. Try and play along, or just listen as the hosts improvise and play out the scenes in which each riddle takes place. It’s such a great concept for a podcast, and it is so much fun! Find it in any podcast app or heyriddleriddle.com
We are sponsored this week by Hero Forge. Hero Forge offers fully customizable tabletop miniatures with dozens of fantasy races and thousands of parts to choose from. That means you can customize your character’s haircut, body proportions, armor, clothing, accessories, even animal familiars. There’s even a motorcycle mount if you want to stan hard for the Knight of Mirrors. And you can change the bases your characters are on, from a tabletop version to a special one for initiative tracking with DM screens, even a necklace, it’s awesome! So visit HeroForge.com to start designing your custom miniature today, and check back often because new content is added every week. That’s heroforge.com.
Finally, we are sponsored this week by BetterHelp, a secure online counseling service. They connect you with licensed counselors through their secure app, letting you message with your therapist and schedule live phone or video sessions. I’ve been seeing my therapist for about six months through BetterHelp and they have an LGBTQ arm called Pride Counceling, and I really, really appreciate her guidance. I really like that I can message her in between sessionsif I’m worrying about something or have something on my mind or just want to say “hey, next time I want to make sure we discuss whatever it is” it really helps me not forget that, and not just show up to my therapy call being like “uhh hi, um, so, brains.” Because BetterHelp wants to help you find the best therapeutic match possible, it’s easy and free to switch counselors if need be. And BetterHelp is also more affordable than traditional counseling, with financial aid also available. You can get 10% off your first month of counseling by signing up at betterhelp.com/jointheparty. That’s better h-e-l-p . com / jointheparty for 10% off your first month. Better h-e-l-p . com / jointheparty.
And now, back to the Afterparty!
[Transition note]
Amanda: Alright we are back I have chips nary a garlic in sight, and I have some questions from our wonderful community on Twitter, Email, and Discord about the general show in general characters! So one from Magdalena which I loved, speaking of our kind of modern campaign how do Milo, Val and the NPC's all text? And do I stand behind Aggies lowercase full punctuation style? What's your style guys? What’s your texting style?
Julia: I think Val’s is chaotic use of like emojis, and all lowercase, all the time.
Amanda: Very good.
Brandon: Yeah I think Milo is all lowercase, punctuation until the end of the texts and he leaves it off and uses a lot of gifs.
Julia: Good.
Eric: I was just thinking that.
Brandon: Yeah tries to text with gifs if at all possible.
Eric: Oh man, yeah I think Emily we've established uses a bunch of emojis. like emojis to punctuate her information and I really like that about Emily. I don't know we'll see what happens I think that Milo's group text is just blowing up with gifs constantly. Like you look away at the wrong time and like something drops like Final Fantasy VII remake and then it's just like 200 gifs in a row.
Julia: What is Milo's group chat name for him and his museum friends?
Brandon: Oh that's a good question!
Amanda: Good question!
Brandon: Um I think it's like “Bowled Over” or like “Science!” with an exclamation point.
Amanda: Maybe it's like the scientist emoji only.
Julia: Beaker beaker beaker.
Eric: Science friends! Scientist emoji.
Amanda: Cute, and a related question from Ruth in discord, how are all of us finding it to play a campaign where we do have easy access to tech, mobile phones, search engines, all of that, and Eric how is it impacting your planning?
Julia: I mean I think in this situation tech is just magic like if we were in a fantasy setting and we were in the scene where we called Aggies phone to overhear what she was doing we would just have like stones of farspeech, or something like that like I think there is a magic equivalent to all technology and vice versa in campaigns like this, because you are reskinning it for a modern setting. So it's basically the same thing like if I rolled a history check in a ancient library, I would probably find the same thing that I would find in like the computers if I was looking up articles on something that I needed to find out about.
Eric: Yeah I'm not afraid of people using Google. Listen, Google tells us the small things that we need to do in our day-to-day lives, it doesn't like uncover secrets. Honestly you'd get more in an ancient library than you would Googling it.
Brandon: Hot take!
Eric: Ooh got me! Yeah there’s a lot of things that you need to do that are secret, and you have to do by communications, and like you know if you could figure everything out with technology then there would be no like there's no conflict it's so many things. Like that's how TV and movies do their thing, like people still miscommunicate and there's still a lot of information you don't just have at your fingertips because you need to interact with each other, and like you do need to know what you're looking for when you're looking for it. So there is an element of investigation checks that just so happens you're doing it in front of a computer.
Brandon: I think it also just makes it more human to like— I appreciate it because you know there's definitely a lot of media where it's like a cellphone would ruin this entire plot. so I think it's it's more fun to play with in the realistic space.
Amanda: Yeah and I do feel like it means that the problems we're pursuing are more complex it's not just like the thing I hate in movies where somebody leaves a room like a minute before the person they need arrives. You know and just that that kind of like not having access to information that should be there is I'm sure fun for some amount of narrative tension, but I'd much rather kind of uncover information that we are uncovering for the first time, then you know need something that's someone who you know just left the inn had.
Brandon: Oh man if only the key was in a rock just a foot away.
[Julia sighs]
Amanda: March towards the beach chair, if only. Shel asks if Milo plays Pokemon, what is his dream team like?
Brandon: Oh good question, I think Milo's favorite gen is a second gen, he's a gold fan but I think he tries to go like old school in this team. You know he'll get like a like a Vulpix in there probably early game goes for like a Zubat but then eventually swaps them out. I think Milo's a Chikorita person.
Julia: Bold choice sir, bold choice.
Eric: Wow after all the shit you've talked about Bulbasaur, you would come to my house and choose Chikorita. That’s—wow.
Brandon: Look it's the final hour of Bulbasaur and Chikorita are completely different and the final evolved form of Chikorita is great and Venusaur is... Has a lot of HP.
Amanda: This is true, it’s a tank. HamiltonOtto asks Eric how high up does the spirit surge count go? You've mentioned 1, 2, 3, does it like keep going until it's just inevitable and if he misses 20 in a row?
Eric: Yes it does go until it's inevitable, but luckily for me Brandon's dice loves rolling ones.
Brandon: I was going to say I'm never gonna get more than three because I'm always gonna roll it.
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: Jaya asks on Twitter is Aggie short for Agamemnon which I just think is a fantastic headcanon. I want you to have that in your life Jaya. It is a short form Margaret like Maggie to Aggie, but you believe what you want and I think I'll try to live up to that standard.
Brandon: I had no idea yeah because uh in Texas obviously Aggie is an agricultural person. People go to A&M are called Aggies.
Julia: I would have assumed Agatha, so here we are.
Amanda: Fascinating, my grandma was called Aggie, and her name was Margaret so that's where I got that from.
Eric: Texas A&M O'Hare
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Even another reason to idolize Coach Taylor. AWildSquirtle asks: what does LTC pride look like, and what mischief does Tuna get into during this time? I'm thinking a lot of neighborhood events, I am not sure if there is a citywide parade maybe folks who want that experience go down to New York, because it is such an easy journey but I'm picturing a lot of like local businesses, and festivals, and you know service events and stuff like that.
Julia: What do all of us wear to pride it's a good question um I think Aggie has one rainbow t-shirt from like a previous LGBTQ Center like food can pantry Drive.
Julia: Love it.
Brandon: Milo definitely has a pair of rainbow pants.
Amanda: Oh! Is that your bowling uniform? That would be cool.
Brandon: Oh yeah I love that! Let's do that!
Eric: Rainbow pants has a lot of different uses.
Amanda: That’s true!
Julia: Val's got a big non-binary patch that they put on their leather jacket for pride.
Brandon: I love that.
Amanda: Cute!
Brandon: Here's the thinking about LTC because it's fantasy and the city we live in, pride’s just all the time. Everyone just loves the LGBTQ+ community.
Amanda: And June is just an opportunity to make sure that the most vulnerable in our communities are being taken care of, and advanced racial equity and stuff like that. Wow LTC so good.
Brandon: Good town.
Julia: What a great town we built a good town.
Amanda: JamieDWN asks in the discord you're not omega-class now but presumably you will level up, in D&D level 16 plus characters are kind of godlike so what might the impact be on Lake Town City if there is level 16 barbarism for example hanging around?
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: What is omega class, I haven't heard that before.
Eric: Omega class is the ranking of mutants that Charles Xavier put together in the X-Men.
Julia: It's the most powerful kind of mutant, it's like it's basically godlike powers.
Amanda: Got it. So Eric how are your treating levelling up in this campaign?
Eric: Yeah I mean I think it's inevitable as we get farther and farther and you develop your powers. Again it’s something that we've established here is that people have powers but they're kind of just like using it for fun, like you have to imagine if there's like a flamethrower somewhere they're like :oh wow I can just like heat up my tea whenever I want” like that's kind of like the extent of their powers and like it is a very long used trope that you need to develop your work. We just finished a little Avatar The Last Airbender—
Julia: I was gonna say thank you Uncle Iroh.
Eric: 61 episodes, yeah we just watched all of our 61 episodes in three days. But like developing just because you have the power doesn't mean you don't need to work on it and there is a leveling up capability. So I don't know how high we're gonna go with leveling but like I also think to what Brandon said about destroying infrastructure, let's look at the Marvel movies like when a big when very big battles happen shit gets destroyed.
Amanda: Yeah, I think Civil War had the most the most like explicit kind of subplot about that.
Eric: Yeah I like that's the effect we're like that's what happened in the Avengers when all those aliens showed up like you destroyed roads, and buildings, and bridges, and you know those superhero movies has incredibly high body count so I don't know if something like that's going to happen necessarily, but like you know power is power there will be destruction.
Amanda: Alanna asked via email, since Aggie seems to be very by the rules did she ever have any struggles with her siblings becoming tops in their fields? She's very proud of them but did she ever consider their powers to be cheating or an unfair advantage over others. I think it’s a really perceptive question and I think she does to some level, and there's a reason that she decided to have a pretty low-key career, and not one where her abilities sort of factor into it very much. That's been a really interesting thing for me to kind of weigh in the character that pull toward duty and service if you defend others by any means necessary, that also means some kind of destruction or also relying on your powers to be better than others. I think that that is fundamentally like not a thing that she's super comfortable with so it's definitely something to keep your eye on I think as the campaign goes on.
Julia: Yeah it's very cool I hope you get to address it in a session at some point.
Amanda: Me too and oh this one comes in from Brandon! What is Ma’s most popular ice cream flavor?
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: I'm gonna guess I think it's like Moose Tracks or Rocky Road or something like that.
Amanda: Aw, cute.
Eric: Yeah I would say some sort of inverted Moose Tracks. I wonder if it's like chocolate but then there's like peanut butter cups in it you know then a caramel ripple.
Brandon: Ooooh.
Julia: Oh that sounds good.
Brandon: Something I don't see enough of is chocolate-covered clusters of like puffed rice little crunchy bits.
Julia: Like Bunch of Crunch!
Amanda: Sounds very tasty!
Brandon: Yeah like Bunch of Crunch.
Amanda: It'd be a little like maple swirl or a little maple candy.
[Everyone ooo’s]
Eric: Maple swirl I like maple swirls or a caramel swirl.
Amanda: There's like coffee maple swirl maybe.
Eric: It's Up Country Surprise.
Julia: Oooh, I don't like that it.
Amanda: No, that sounds bad. That sounds like a—
Eric: Okay so it’s not called Up Country Surprise.
Julia: A lewd act is what that sounds like.
[Amanda and Eric laughing]
Eric: That's like um so there's a bacteria you can get called Giardia, which is when you drink untreated water and you get it from I've done this for camping up in the Canadian wilderness you get it from beaver poop being in the water.
Julia: Gross!
Eric: So that's what Up Country Surprise is.
Julia: Oh I hate that.
Eric: Up Country Surprise!
Julia: I hate it, I hate it real bad!
Brandon: Val's mom has also named one of their sculptures Up Country Surprise.
Julia: Oh no…
Amanda: It's very boobsie.
Eric: It's just lots of boobs. Um something that I don't remember we noted or not, the ice cream trucks did come from Ma’s. Like that—
Amanda: Oh yeah.
Eric: Okay I just I didn't I didn't know that was something I need to explain or not I saw it floating around. It's like they did get it, we did talk about this it did come from Weird Al's Strange Vehicle Emporium.
Brandon: Weird Al’s Vehicle Emporium, No Relation!
Eric: Right, but Ma’s is like renting the ice cream trucks like it's part of their fleet.
Julia: How many ice cream trucks are in their fleet though?
Eric: A decent amount.
Julia: I just need to know how many I have to destroy.
Amanda: Yeah, Val has a list.
Eric: I think it's not many. I think you saw — I don't know
Julia: Okay!
Eric: I could tell you the number but then I’d just be making it up, I'd say like four or five they're pretty small—
Julia: I’ve seen most of them then.
Eric: And they tried to expand and it fell apart.
Brandon: So you’ve punched two fifths of them.
Julia: Mmhmm.
[Amanda laughing]
Amanda: Brighteyes29 asks in the discord, now that we’re solidly into campaign two, are there any lessons or wisdom that we learned in the first campaign that we find ourselves applying to the new one? Either as players/DMs or as podcasters, and Julia yours from your full podcast experience and listening to campaign one.
Brandon: We've talked about before but I think for me the biggest like two things are one like leaning in and not — none of us are terribly combative but like working with the DM instead of like against the DM, is something I learned in the first campaign to do better. Then also just like trusting the DM just like jumping in headfirst without necessarily — not thinking of the consequences, but like just trusting that your DM has your best interest at heart and they're like on your team as well.
Amanda: Yeah I think for me it's being less scared to sort of push at the world building and doing the world building exercise together was something all of us decided and we've talked about you know in the previous episodes, but that really gave me a sense of ownership and feeling like I can go places, or do things, or call people, and also just sort of add things that I discover along the way. It makes me feel both for my particular character a lot more sort of like in her background and in her head because that is something that she knows a lot about, and also just as a player you know more fully able to say like these are things I want to do and then it's on Eric to make them happen.
Julia: Yeah I think for me it's mostly just like doing the thing that feels true to the character, and not doing the thing that I think is going to like win Eric's puzzle the quickest you know?
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: I want to do the things that Val feels like they would have to do in the moment, which is why I went and investigated the teens even though I'm like I rolled a six and this is probably just a distraction but I want to go and do this anyway.
Amanda: Yeah!
Brandon: Punch a truck!
Julia: Punch a truck!
Eric: If you go do the distraction, I'll let you punch a truck later!
Julia: Thank you!
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: I think I'm leaning into the things that I like the most, and I think that I'm the best at as a dungeon master, which is world building and using game mechanics from other places to make Dungeons and Dragons more interesting and more fun to listen to as a podcast. I'm trying to let some stuff go, like I'm not being myself as much about not being good at voices but instead I'm trying to flesh out the NPC's instead. But at the same time I'll do a bad Russian accent for you! That's just what dogs sound like.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Yeah it's just kind of letting go and taking the experience that I had from campaign one and being able to do it from the jump. The thing that I was most excited about starting a new campaign is I thought I really started getting the groove of it starting in Bachelorette Party, and now I'm like oh I'm doing this from the beginning of campaign two. And I feel really good about it.
Julia: Mmhmm.
Amanda: I feel good about - I'm happy to be on the receiving end of all that planning!
Brandon: And Sour Anthony is an excellent voice so how dare you dismurge that voice.
[Julia groans]
Amanda: The more frustrated we get at that voice means the better it is!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey I’m just trying to do my best here.
Brandon: AHH! Let’s get him out of here!
Amanda: Alright time for spoily corner!
Julia: Spoily corner!
Amanda: Woo!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Alright spoils!
Amanda: Alright first one: Monty?! WHAT?!
[Amanda and Julia both hmmm]
Amanda: I don’t know! [her voice gets higher] Who can say!
Eric: Just put a figure, I didn't say it was Monty.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yes, it is a giant mountain lobster that's a good point. It's a giant mountain lobster it is similar to the myth of Monty so that was what was first on Aggie's mind.
Eric: I will just — you guys can believe it's Monty I just want to say I have never confirmed that it is or is not Monty yes.
Amanda: I don’t think that it is literally Monty but I do think that this is the you know instantiation of a myth I grew up with, which is very funny. Secondly is Dr. Morrow the Knight of Mirrors?
Julia: Nooo.
Eric: Ahhh!!!
Julia: No, I don’t think so.
Brandon and Amanda: Who can say!
Eric: [Laughing] Julia can’t say anything just NO.
Julia: I don’t think so. I’m just reacting to these as me the player who you know knows stuff and is just like hmm, nah I don't think so.
Amanda: Is Dr. Morrow evil though?
Julia: Hmm…
Brandon: That's a question.
Julia: I hope not.
Amanda: I don't know!
Brandon: Who can say?
Amanda: I hope not.
Eric: Who can really say? In this world of gray, there's no black and white it is only gray, so who can really say what is true and what it's not?
Amanda: Fair enough, is that a quotation, or just a little emo poem?
Eric: Yeah that's Uncle Iroh.
Amanda: Oh well, we're off to start the Legend of Korra, in the meantime thank you everybody for your questions, thank you for being interested in our campaign. It makes us really happy, and we can't wait to share the next episode with you!
Brandon: Bye guys!
Julia: Later!
Eric: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. But you can get No Capes D&D Guide to Superheroing and Reskinning written by me! It’s not even $100,000! It's less than that!
Brandon: It doesn't even cost $40!
Eric: It's less than that!
Amanda: It’s not even 13!
Eric: It's less than $13!
Amanda: And we'll see you next week with a brand new episode of Join the Party. Bye!

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time, on Join the Party…
Eric: As Aggie, Val, and Milo wait for the call to action from Emily Slaughter they have some business to attend to. Val gets some damning photos about what went down at the auction from their mob boss father. Milo unlocks the ghost who was trapped in Dr. Morrow’s science experiment, and Aggie tries to find out more about the Nephews but is interrupted by her youngest sister. That night Emily sends them the mission: scout out the Nephews boathouse at the lake in historic Lake Town. Val and Milo try to unlock the garage as Aggie bluffs her way in pretending to be the Nephews super. They don't buy it and Aggie finds herself surrounded by goons. When your nephew, your nephew all the way from your first lobster pie to your last dying day, let's get the party started!
[Theme music]
[Waves hitting the shore, bugs chirping]
Eric: Milo and Val, you are outside of the metal garage that is blocking your entrance into the bottom of the boathouse. there is a very heavy lock. I will say just to give this some more context the lock is tied to a chain which loops around the garage and a loop in the concrete and there's a very heavy lock that holds it together.
Julia: That I tried to break earlier.
Eric: Yes as you tried to [laughs] as Val tried to smash it open with a rock, and you are unable to do so. At this moment as you're inspecting this big metal lock you hear from Milo's phone which is calling Aggie’s phone there is this angry voice that says
Eric (as angry voice): Hey I know who you are, and you're not going anywhere!
Eric: Aggie upstairs, there is a smaller about 20 year old who's getting up in your grill, and three very large high schoolers, including the one with the patchy beard who you talk to as well are menacing closer to you.
Amanda (as Aggie): If you actually live here, I know you know who I am. Question is who the fuck are you?
[Collective woahs]
Julia: Shit!
Brandon: Got em!
Eric: So what are you trying to intimidate them? What are you trying to do?
Amanda: Yeah these guys are gonna prevent me from leaving. I'm gonna do my damnedest so that they don't underestimate what they're doing.
Eric: Okay, why don’t you make an intimidate check, and I'm gonna do an intimidate check back.
Brandon: New Aggie is my new favorite character.
Amanda: The thing is that I've said “you think you're better than me” for the last month.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Sorry.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda:I got a 14.
Eric: Oh no I got a 15.
Julia: Oh no come on!
Amanda: Shit.
Eric: The smaller guy he just has like a really like a wispy moustache that he’s holding onto he's like
Eric (as wispy mustache kid): You don't need to know who the fuck I am, I'm the boss around here.
Amanda (as Aggie): So you don’t need to know who the fuck I am!
Eric (as wispy mustache kid): Get ‘em boys!
Amanda (as Aggie): I came by to check on your gas. You're really gonna do this?
Eric: And two of the large boys are gonna come grab you—
Amanda: Good luck.
Eric: So they're both gonna try to grapple you, I'm gonna make an athletics check and you can make either an athletics or an acrobatics check to get from being grappled.
Amanda: Let's do acrobatics.
Eric: Okay so we're gonna do the first—
Amanda: I'm gonna try to like duck and sweep my leg to kick them down
Eric: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: First one’s a 10.
Eric: Well the first one I had a natural one
Amanda: Yeaah!!
Eric: So you want to sweep his leg?
Amanda: I want to duck under his arms yeah and sweep his leg.
Eric: Alright yeah you definitely do that and he falls on its butt, and it's really embarrassing he falls in like a puddle of Gatorade—
Amanda: Great!
Eric: So he's prone and—
Amanda: I hope it’s red. Go fuck yourself.
Eric: It’s definitely red, it's gross!
Brandon: Even through the phone Milo is like
Brandon (as Milo): Oh man that's embarrassing.
Eric: He’s like “oh I know what flavor it is.” And then we're gonna do another grapple check.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: [gasps] Natural 20.
[Collective OOOOH!]
Julia: Yes!
Eric: Yeah what do you do to this lad?
Amanda: Okay so I'm gonna see that he's coming at me with his arms outstretched like a scooby-doo villain, and see these off-balance a little bit so I'm just gonna shove him on like one side of his giant chest and he's gonna pirouette around and then knock into like the kitchen and pots and pans are gonna fall over him.
Eric: Sure! this kind of clank clank clank clank
Eric (as goon): Oh no! That’s where I make my mac and cheese!
[Amanda laughing]
Julia: Oh now I want mac and cheese!
Eric (as goon): Hey that’s the good one for the hot plate!
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Alright so they try to attack you, Aggie, this is kind of a loose initiative, it is your turn. You have the two guys one is prone, and the other one is mixed up at the moment so they're momentarily incapacitated, and you have the other two in front of you what do you do?
Eric (as goon): Hey Mantis, the super seems really actually kind of strong. Maybe we shouldn't mess with her.
Eric (as Mantis): [with a cartoony villain voice] I'm gonna mess with whoever I want! See? I’m gonna take her down!
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: I’m gonna give you one more chance to walk away from this.
Eric (as Mantis): I've never walked away from anything! E-except for my friends who didn't care for me. I walked away from them, and then I made new friends, I made family these are all my cousins!
Julia: I like that this guy sounds like Shadow from Sonic the Hedgehog—
Brandon: Oh my god it does.
Julia: Mm-hmm.
Eric: This is great.
Amanda: Okay, I am going to just do some martial arts monk shit and I'm going to—
Eric: [Laughing] Classic.
Amanda: I'm gonna do to you unarmed strikes against him, and shove him backward and then try to just do kind of like a Vulcan nerve pinch. Like just try to sort of shove him down with my hand around the back of his neck, I don't want to like punch and leave a bruise or anything, but I do want to put him down.
Eric: Yeah, do some attacks!
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Alright, 11 plus dex, that's a 16 to hit.
Eric: Um, that hits. Why don't you roll damage for the first one. So do you want these to both be unarmed?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Okay so then do your unarmed damage.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: That's a 7.
Eric: Okay so the the guy with the wispy moustache be like
Eric (as wispy mustache kid): AHH! NO! I don’t wanna get hit in the fight!
Eric: And he jumps behind the big teenager, the big high schooler. That damage goes to the big high schooler.
Amanda: Aw beans.
Amanda (as Aggie): Your friend’s a coward.
Eric (as goon): Ah well you know we're family so it's hard for that—
Eric: So that seven damage goes to the big high schooler.
Amanda: I'm gonna roll my eyes and shove him backwards as well with the hopes that both of them fall down.
Eric: Okay so you're gonna do a shove attack?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Great!
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 12 +5 for 17!
Eric: Okay 17, um okay why don't you do damage, and we'll see what happens.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 4 +3! 7.
Eric: Okay so that's 7 so that one, you're doing to the big high schooler. The big high schooler, you've knocked him out. So you—
Brandon: Aggie! Aggie! Aggie! Aggie!
Eric: Yeah you can push him over and you—
Amanda: So can the other guy be entombed underneath his friend like a coward?
Eric: Yeah, let me let me make a dexterity saving throw. You know I come up with these fights and I'm like you know what you seem pretty deadly, and immediately I roll like shit—
Amanda: I’m a monk, baybee!!
Julia: You say you love monks. and yet.
Eric: Okay yeah, I think he's stuck under the big high schooler.
Amanda: Definitely so while I'm here further into the kitchen, can I do another investigation check and just see if there's anything else I missed in terms of clues of what these brats’ criminal enterprise actually is?
Eric: Yes absolutely so you can do an investigation check. If you stay in there the other big goons will come after you eventually just you know.
Amanda: Okay!
Eric: Do an investigation check.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Uh 9.
Eric: Okay what are you exactly are you looking for?
Amanda: Actually, I’m gonna use a luck point and reroll.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: A 10.
Eric: Alright so what exactly are you looking for? Ask me a question.
Amanda: I'm looking for is there anything like hung up or near the door that goes downstairs that indicates what might be down there?
Eric: Yes that is a really good question. Next to the stairs going into the garage area that we've talked about, there are a set of goalie hockey pads. You can't really see what has messed them up so much but they do look like there are pieces taken out of it. So if someone's going downstairs you think that they're putting on these hockey pads and they're getting roughed up. It's kind of like when you see those videos of attack dogs like being trained and they have those oversized pillows you know like they wear it's like that.
Brandon: Are you telling me there are puppies downstairs, Eric?!
Eric: Yes this is Puppy Party. That’s exactly what’s happening.
Julia: We are not opening that door.
Amanda: Big fluffy dogs.
Eric: Okay I will say that Milo and Val do not know that.
Julia: No I know, Julia does not want to open the door but Val is ready to break it down.
Eric: Okay the two other lads are gonna come at you Aggie, and they're gonna try to grapple you again.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: So they get up and they're both like
Eric (as goon): Oh! Oh no, I sat in Gatorade. It’s never gonna come out!
Eric: And they're both gonna try to grab you, so again making athletics or an acrobatics role.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: What's that Julia?
Julia: That's another nat 20 brah.
Eric: Jesus Christ.
Brandon: Holy shit.
Eric: Alright so this is gonna be the one with the Gatorade on his body, what do you do him?
Amanda: Great, how is he coming at me?
Eric: He has to stand up, and he's trying to get some of the Gatorade off, he tries to wipe it off with a paper towel. Then his rest of his movement he's just coming at you to give you a bear hug from behind.
Amanda: Oh from behind.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Cool, I am going to— Julia can you give me some vocabulary to describe what I'm gonna do here? I'm gonna so he's coming at me from behind—
Julia: He's going for the waist lock.
Amanda: Yes, I am going to squat down and then when he tries to grab me like pop up to like pop him over me on his back.
Julia: You're basically doing a hip up. But like I guess probably doing like a hip toss or an arm drag involved in that?
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Hell yeah! Whatever that means! I love that!
Amanda: Exactly!
Brandon: Hell yeah!
Amanda: He's trying to grab me but instead he finds himself on his back, wind knocked out of him, Gatorade on his butt.
Eric: I like that, roll for damage.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 7!
Eric: 7 damage, he does not look like he's having fun, and then the other one who got messed up in the pots and pans is gonna come at you again, athletics or acrobatics
Julia: Mac and cheese guy.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 13.
Eric: Alright I rolled on 19, so the one you he is upset that you ruin his mac and cheese, so again he's gonna come at you from the side and he's a big guy. I think he has about a foot on you and he just gets you in like a bear hug from behind and he's gonna try to walk you over to the stairs
Amanda: Oh boy.
Eric: Yeah at this point the one who's under the passed out guy is like
Eric (as wispy mustache kid): Yeah throw her down there! She deserves it!
Amanda (as Aggie): You guys really don't want to know what happens when I call my backup okay?
Eric (as wispy mustache kid): Yeah you don't really want to know what's in our basement!
Amanda (as Aggie): Actually, I'm really curious I'd love to know. Please show me.
Eric (as wispy mustache kid): Well you-you can see yourself!
Eric: We're gonna cut back to Milo and Val, I think you hear the basement line, and now you are still standing in front of the garage.
[Waves crashing against the shore]
Julia: Val just looks at Milo's like
Julia (as Val): Well that sounds bad—
[Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): Do you have anything with your weird ghost powers that can get us into the garage? Or should we just run through the front?
Brandon (as Milo): I am looking I genuinely don't think I do.
Julia (as Val): Alright then we'll just run to the front, if you don't have anything.
Brandon: Yeah I mean I do have charm person so we can like get our way into it.
Julia: Cool, let's do it.
Eric: Alright I want both of you to make perception checks,
Julia: Sure, it's not my specialty.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: I got a 6.
Brandon: I got an 8 +5 for 13.
Eric: Wonderful, Val there's this like greenery kind of everywhere in between all of the bungalows and say if this is over at the where the lake is I think that there's just some woods that kind of transverse the whole just like in between everything and there is some definitive rustling happening from the bushes.
Julia: Alright, I'm trying to like understand how I noticed it with a 6, and Brandon didn't notice it with a 13.
Eric: Listen, perception can mean a lot of things Julia.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Alright Val’s gonna— yeah Val’s gonna rage up and then go investigate.
Amanda: Yeaaah!
Eric: [Laughing] Alright, what does it look like? Val investigates while raging?
Julia: It's just vibrating. Just a normal person investigating rustling in the bushes but they're vibrating, you know!
Eric: She's like “wait I have to go do something” [makes buzzing noise]
Amanda: [With a thick New York accent] Woodland creature you think it better than me hiding in the bushes?
Julia (as Val): Well, you know it could be like a mountain lion or like a very very vicious raccoon. You should see the ones that hang out at my mother's house they're very mean they fight over the garbage.
Brandon (as Milo): Val what are you talking about we're what there's no raccoons? What are you doing?
Julia (as Val): There’s something in the bush over here, hold on one second. .
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t hear anything.
Eric: “Hey, I'm gonna go check out this racoon,” and you have brass knuckles, amazing.
Julia: Yeah! I’m gonna fight this racoon.
Eric: So you push through kind of the wooded area here and you see that there are three shadows, you hear that there rustling and you can make out like three bodies back there.
Julia: Are there any like low-lying branches on the tree?
Eric: Yeah, definitely.
Julia: Val’s gonna chop at one of the branches to see if these figures move at the sound of a large branch.
Eric: Amazing!
Julia: Yeah yeah, yeah see if I can do it.
Eric: Yeah, I think that you swing on the branch and it's one of those heavy loose ones and it pops back and it like hits all the people who are standing there like
Eric (as unknown person): Hey what are you doing?
Julia (as Val): What are you doing?
Eric: You look up and there are just some college kids standing in front of you, they’re all wearing all black, but of course the oh sometimes the only black that you have are like black with white writing on it.
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: The band shirt the.
Eric: Yeah, one’s wearing a band shirt, the other one was wearing like black pants but have sequins on it—
Brandon: Tuxedo pants.
Eric: One of them’s wearing a shirt that is like the the tuxedo shirt but it's the one that look just looks like a tuxedo.
Amanda: I’m sure someone has their LBD over like yoga pants.
Eric: Yeah definitely.
Julia (as Val): What are you doing?
Eric: We see that all of them have are wearing lanyards, and they all have their student IDs from Morrow University. All the kids are startled and try to run from you.
Julia (as Val): What are you doing?! If you're gonna wear all black at least put it inside out so you dumb tuxedos not showing.
Eric (as college student): [Frantically] But it’s the only one I had!!
Julia (as Val): Put it inside out you stupid idiot.
Eric (as college student): Go away!
Julia (as Val): You go away!
Eric (as college student): You’re a stupid idiot!
Julia (as Val): What? You know—
Eric: They're running.
Julia: Okay.
[Amanda laughing]
Julia: I don't think Val’s gonna run after them.
Eirc: That's fine.
Julia: Did Val see any names on the student lanyards by any chance?
Eric: Make an investigation check.
Julia: I’ve got -1 to that.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Val doesn’t care what they’re punching though—
Julia: I a 17 though.
Eric: You know this is River Greens, long blonde hair tied up in a man bun and their beard doesn't connect yet.
Julia: They just fuckin’ run off?
Eric: Yeah, all three of them go in different directions, but you were able to see one of theirs was named one of their IDs was River Green.
Amanda: Was it that it was helpfully offset against a white bib of a tuxedo shirt?
Eric: Yeah he was the one wearing the tuxedo shirt 100%. River Greens with an S, spelled like river and then greens g r e e n and then s.
Julia: Val yells after them
Julia (as Val):I saw your face!
Eric (as River): No you didn’t!
Julia (as Val): River!
Eric (as River): Ahhh!!!
Eric: Milo, Val has gone and done something else, what do you do?
Julia: [Laughing] Sorry.
Brandon: Ahhhhh um crap so hearing that Aggie sort of has things handled, and I figure they're gonna come to the basement I think I'm gonna try to follow Val. I need my backup here and so I'm gonna try to run into the brush and see what's going on with Val.
Eric: Okay you see Val's standing kind of in the woods.
Julia: Looking pissed
Brandon (as Milo): Uh… Val?
Julia (as Val): Fucking college students came by, I don't think they were supposed to be here, but I don't think they have anything to do with what's going on at the boathouse.
Brandon (as Milo): College kids are not supposed to be anywhere we all can agree on that. Can we—
Julia (as Val): They should be in their dorms and that's it.
Brandon (as Milo): Exactly, should we go back and help Aggie do you think?
Julia (as Val): Oh yeah, yeah, sorry. I got super distracted.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah it seems like maybe let's go.
Eric: Alright so now we're gonna go back to Aggie. Aggie you were in the clutches of this oversized high schooler, and the other high schooler with the Gatorade on his pants is getting up, and the smaller one is still is yelling stuff at you as he’s pushing him off of him he's like
Eric (as wispy mustache): Yeah you're gonna see what's down there! You can get what's best for you!
Eric: You would try to escape from the grapple because it is your turn. But you were currently grappled that means that you can't move in you're kind of at the whim of this guy who's holding you.
Amanda: So I think my action is I'm gonna have to just try to break this grapple.
Eric: Wonderful.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 16 +3 for 19.
Julia: Heck yeah.
Eric: Yep I rolled a 10 yeah you break out of the grapple.
Amanda: Great.
Eric: So you still have your movement—
Amanda: Enemies behind me.
Eric: Yeah you have the goon who’s around you, the other goon who's getting up with Gatorade on him and then you have the leader.
Amanda: I'm gonna grab the goalie pad and go downstairs.
Eric: You're gonna just willingly go down the stairs?
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: Alright, cool you want to grab all the pads?
Amanda: I'm gonna swoop up whatever I can in one arm, so if I can, put my arms through the chest pad or something.
Eric: Yeah I'll let you grab the chest pad.
Amanda: Alright, nice!
Eric: Yeah you can run down the stairs.
Amanda: Yeah, I'm gonna use all my speed and head down to the bottom of the stairs, trying to assess the situation as I go. I feel Aggie’s not gonna leave a house with something mysterious and possibly dangerous in the basement in Lake Town City.
Eric: Nice okay, there is also a key on the wall and there's another very large padlock on this. I'll let you open the lock but, I will say to the your character you're like there is a big lock keeping something in there.
Amanda: Oh yeah no I'm gonna open it.
Eric: Okay, cool, yeah you grab the the chest plate—
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: And you grab the key and you want to run in there?
Amanda: Yeah!!
Eric: Alright cool. So what do you what does it look like?
Amanda: I think in a self-defense class or something or just like out in the streets of Lake Town City, I would have just learned how to break a hold like that. I’m gonna put my elbows into his bicep to just like break the hold, and then it's kind of just like burst forth as quick as I can and cause I'm facing the door, I can hear the movements behind me people getting ready so I'm just gonna use my left arm to grab the biggest pad that I can reach, I'll grab the key on the same swoop people have clearly done both these things in succession so they're like hung right next to each other and then unlock the padlock and run down the stairs.
Eric: So you're now in a— so the light—
Amanda: It feels good to make destructive choices!
Eric: It's wonderful, I love it.
Brandon: Welcome to my world Amanda!
Amanda: The ghost in my chest did it! You can't blame me!
[Brandon and Julia laughing]
Eric: The Brandon Grugle story. So there are like shitty halogen lights upstairs but there's just nothing, no lights down there. It's also like dank and wet and like the ground is a combination of wet sand, and dry sand you can never get like a real footing, and the only light is streaming in from the stairs. Behind you the leader says
Eric (as Mantis) Yeah that's exactly what we wanted you to do! Good!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yep, but I did it myself so it doesn't count. So ha!
Eric (as Mantis): No, it does count! Now you're in danger!
Eric: You hear like bubbling and the size of this— so a boathouse is supposed to dock boats so you can easily put like two sailboats with their sails down in here, it's like a big garage. But at the bottom instead of concrete it's as wet and dry sand coming together and, from the outside from where Val and and Milo were you see that eventually it would slip into the water. But instead of there being any boats there is a pretty sizable above-ground pool. Inside that above-ground pool is a mountain lobster the size of a Volkswagen buck, and it's staring right at you and making bubbling sounds in your general direction. Just like
[Eric makes a high pitched raspberry noise]
Amanda (as Aggie): Hi, pal!
Eric (as mountain lobster): [high pitched noise]
Amanda: I'm gonna pull a granola bar out of my pocket and toss it in unwrapped.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Yeah, unwrapped?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: What a kindness!
Eric: Amazing, amazing, I want you to make an animal handling check.
Amanda: Sure!
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: A non-natural 20. Animals love me!
Eric: [laughing] Oh my god, animals love you. Yeah with a 20 yeah you throw the granola towards the oversized mountain lobster the giant mountain lobster—
Amanda: Why lob it? Underhand! This is not a threat.
Eric: You lob it and it's like bobbing in just this water in the oversized pool and then it lifts out a giant claw I kind of like pokes at it and like
Eric (as mountain lobster): [High pitched raspberries inquisitively]
Eric: And one of it’s googly eyes kind of looks down at it. It's kind of like poking at it, and they try to cut it in half and eventually cuts it in half, and it grabs like half of it it just like shoves and it's like a little mouth.
Brandon: Portion control.
Julia: Very important.
Amanda: Adorable.
Eric: Alright let's go back to Val and Milo.
Julia: Okay/
Eric: What are you guys doing?
Brandon (as Milo): Val I think this is our chance to be heroes. Our first real chance to be heroes, we can break in the front door and say ”no crime!” And stop them, and then go help Aggie.
Julia (as Val): Love that besides the “no crime” part.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah that's fair.
Eric: Tuna is now like floating above Milo and is like
Eric (as Tuna): Hmm Aggie’s gonna love that part where you ran away to look at kids in the woods.
Julia (as Val): Don’t tell.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna, go away please, we don’t need you anymore.
Eric (as Tuna): Mmmokaybye!
Eric: And then Tuna disappears.
Julia (as Val): How fast are you?
Brandon (as Milo): I’m what [stammering] I uh I I’ve I’ve run some races here and there on the playground.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Out of character how fast are you?
Brandon: 30 speed.
Julia: Okay it's about the same.
Eric: You can both do it, if you both want to spend your time getting back to the front you can.
Julia: Would I be able to use my charger feat though? And potentially punch someone as I break through the door.
Amanda: You're raging right?
Eric: Yes if both of you want to dash over there and then I would let you use the the charger feat because you are raging.
Julia: Alright let's do it!
Eric: Okay cool—
Brandon: So as Val is going to bust through the door I also felt a little jealous so I'm gonna try to make an entrance. So I'm gonna cast chill touch which is it just makes a giant ghostly skeletal hand in front of me, and it's gonna look really menacing.
Eric: Nice! I love it, alright yeah so you two run over and you throw open the door so you see that there are two really tall children and a teenager just looking down these stairs and they look a little they look surprised, but they're also like relieved,
Eric (as goon): Well we don't have to deal with her anymore sounds great. Oh it stopped— we gotta go!!
Julia: And then Val just punches him in the face.
Eric: Alright, great!
Amanda: Excellent!
Eric: What is charger?
Julia: It means I can make a melee attack as a bonus action when I dash.
Eric: Okay cool so you're gonna get all the way in there and you can do a bonus action to punch this guy.
Julia: I ran at least 10 feet in a straight line so I gained +5 to my attacks damage, or I can push the target 10 feet away actually, I think I'm gonna push the target 10 feet away and push him down the stairs.
Amanda: Daaaang!
Eric: Sure yeah let's see if you hit if the attack right.
Julia: Great!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Well it was an 18 plus my strength which is 5 so it's a 23!
Amanda: YE!
Brandon: Dang!
Eric: [laughing] Okay so he sees just vibrating and running up on him —
Amanda: Ghostly hand behind you!
Eric: Yeah and he's going
Eric (as goon): AHH! Protect me!
Eric: And he grabs one of the large children and puts him in front of my forgot he had that so now he's replaced the one who was caught up in the pots and pans who has not been done any damage to. So I will let you because he switched someone, I will let you do damage or push them.
Julia: Okay then I'll do damage.
Eric: Okay!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Alright, so it's gonna be so that's a 6
Eric: Mhm.
Julia: +5, plus an additional 5.
[Collective cheering]
Eric: Alright, so yeah what does it look like when you just run in?
Julia: I just punch him in the face.
Eric: You just run in and he’s like “AHH!” and this large child in front of you?
Julia: Yeah, and that child goes down.
Eric: Amazing that child goes down that child goes down this crumples.
Brandon: High schooler right? Like at fighting age?
Eric: Oh definitely fighting age but he's like an oversized high schooler and he's in deep.
Amanda: He can drive.
Eric: Yeah yeah alright so now uh Milo since you said you would want to do that next, who do you want to chill touch?
Brandon: I'm gonna join— like what I recognize that is the leader?
Eric: Oh yeah you would know.
Brandon: Okay then yeah, I'm gonna send my chill to the leader and say
Brandon (as Milo): It's time for you to chill.
Julia: Jesus.
Eric: [Chuckles] And then a ghost hand comes out like
Eric (as ghost hand): I don’t understand the symbology of that!
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t either!
Eric: Is that an attack?
Brandon: Yeah it's an attack so I make a range spell attack against the creature, and on a hit it takes 1d8 necrotic.
Eric: Okay make it an attack roll please!
Amanda: I love that necrotic damage.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: Well that would be a 7.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Interesting, interesting, yeah that does not hit. So I think that you focus too much on the chill pun and then this skeleton hand is like “what? I don't under— I don't understand that joke”
Brandon: Does it still look cool as hell though?
Eric: It looks really cool but it just does not do any damage, it's very spooky.
Brandon: So I also have to roll on my spiritual surge table cause I just cast a spell.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: It's an 8!
Eric: Yes so you now have +1 to you. Nothing bad happens to you tonight. At this point the leader and the one with Gatorade on his pants are like
Eric (as gatorade pants): Oh we have to go do we have to go do the thing.E
Eric (as Mantis): Yeah we do!
Eric: They're both gonna make disengages, and they're going to run outside the large guy with Gatorade on his pants says
Eric (as gatorade pants): Oh should we leave them there with— should they leave them there with the thing?
Eric (as Mantis): Oh yeah it'll take care of them, it'll mess them up like they messed up all the other guys.
Eric: And they're gonna run outside and I want both of the people upstairs to make perception checks.
Brandon (as Milo): Uh, Val, that’s not good.
Julia: Because as we know, I’m great at that!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Actually it was pretty good! I got a 15!
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: I got a 10.
Eric: Alright Val you hear that there is a large car starting outside, Milo, Val, do you want to go downstairs?
Brandon: Absolutely!
Julia: I think Val goes
Julia (as Val): You go take care of Aggie, imma go fuck these guys up.
Amanda: Yeah! Punch another truck! Punch another truck! Punch another truck!
Brandon: Punch a truck!
Julia:I would like to charge her feat again, and go try to punch one of the guys.
Eric: Okay wonderful!

[Transition note]
Eric: So Val you run outside, and these two guys are hopping into an ice cream truck. Make a perception check.
Julia: Oh god stop making me roll perception!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Ugh, it’s a 7.
Eric: Alright with a 7, weird how they're getting it an ice cream truck.
Julia: Weird!
Eric: Because an ice cream truck— you've seen one before, because you like ice cream.
Julia: Uh huh, and definitely a couple of nights ago or anything.
Eric: Just Italian ice. I'm a big fan of Italian ices, yes you do realize that they are both ice cream trucks, but you have no way to discern if it was the same one.
Amanda: Oh so they don't see like a dent or anything, I see.
Eric: Right you can't see. But Val is of sound mind they know that there are two.
Julia: I’m not a fucking idiot, even though I have -1 in intelligence.
Eric: You know I’m not a fuckin’ idiot, I know they're both ices whenever I see ‘em.
Amanda: You think ya bettah than me with your AP classes?
Brandon: Is Italian ice just a euphemism for murder?
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: Yes. Yeah I give ‘em the real the lemon italian ice if you know what I’m sayin’. So both of them have hopped into one ice cream truck there is another ice cream truck right next to it. Amanda: So they're just leaving the passed out guy?
Eric: They’re — yes they are leaving — they're leaving two of them. So both of them are hopping into one of the ice cream trucks and they're trying to peel out. I figured this would be your turn because they disengaged.
Julia: I want redemption.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: I wasn't able to flip it the last time and so I just want to like charge and like just kind of shoulder and try to knock it on its side.
Eric: You want a shoulder check it?
Julia: Yeah!
Eric: Okay so we're gonna do the same thing as last time I'm gonna come up with an AC for an ice cream truck and [laughs] and you're gonna try to do a shove attack.
Julia: Yeah that’s great. Can I recklessly attack this ice cream truck?
Eric: Sure yeah you just would have disadvantage if something comes back at you.
Julia: That's fine.
Brandon: Aren't they all reckless attacks against an ice cream truck?
Eric: Definitely.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: That was a 15
Amanda: Ooo.
Julia: For the first roll,
[dice rolls]
Julia: And then a 21 on the second.
Brandon: Daaaang!
Eric: So with the 21, damn okay, why don't you roll for damage?
Julia: Am I shoving it though?
Eric: You're shoving it but I'm trying to think of a way to decide how well you're shoving it, so what would your damage be for this?
Julia: So it would be
[Dice rolling]
Julia: 3 +5 which is an 8 but if I was charging it would also be an additional 5.
Eric: Okay so 13.
Julia: Yeah
Eric: Okay yeah I think that this is what you're made for, this is what your powers are for. Are you like dropping the shoulder? What are you doing?
Julia: It's kind of like going under and going up as I hit into it.
Eric: I love it okay, so yeah you're dropping a shoulder you're using your spiked shoulders you have spiked shoulder pads. I think with the amount of damage you were supposed to do, yeah you just like fucking bodycheck this thing over.
Amanda: Yeahhh!
Eric: It's top-heavy, there's an ice cream cone on top, yeah you just body check of this ice cream over and you hear
Eric (as goons): AHHHHH!
Julia (as Val): What you hit me in the parking lot, now you can't handle a little bit this time? Come on.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: So then the leader and one of the goons are gonna get up it's like
Eric (as goon): Oh they just bodychecked our ice cream truck is that bad?
Eric (as Mantis): I don't have time to decide whether it's bad or not we just got to go we're gonna be late you take care of them!
Eric: The leader is gonna break off and go to the other ice cream truck while the goon is gonna charge it you.
Amanda: Gotta have two.
Eric: Okay so I rolled a natural 1, I'm rolling like dog shit today. Since you recklessly attacked I get advantage right.
[Drive rolls]
Julia: Oh yeah, hell yeah, do that!
Eric: Well that's a 19 does that hit your AC?
Julia: Yes that does, that's okay!
Eric: You see at the last second the goon charges at you and then pulls like a pipe out of his sleeve, so it looks like he's gonna tackle you and just whacks you with the pipe because he's running at you that's gonna do 9 damage.
Julia: Is that halved?
Eric: Yeah halve it to 4. Okay so you're you're engaged with—
Julia: Uh oh, so I can’t disengage without taking an attack of opportunity?
Eric: Yes so you can take an attack of opportunity—
Julia: Oh I’m gonna take an attack of opportunity, cause I wanna take this dumbass down.
Eric: Do you still have disadvantage?
Julia: Yes because it lasts the whole round.
Eric: Okay wonderful so I'm gonna do that to you again. Does a 17 hit?
Julia: Yes it does.
Eric: Okay so I'm gonna do another one to you alright that is a 6 which is halved to 3. So you took that attack of opportunity you want to go after the leader?
Julia: Yes!
Eric (as Mantis): Ayy whata you do you do — you're a pedestrian you need to get out of the way!
Julia: I'd like to grapple him, I don't want him going anywhere.
Eric: Okay so you're gonna grapple?
Julia: Yeah
Eric: Cool, alright so we know grapple, he's gonna do a acrobatics check against your athletics check.
Julia: Alright, but I get a bonus because it's a strength check.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Alright cool, it's a 15 +5 so a non-natural 20.
Eric: Wonderful, alright I got less than that. Yeah so you're holding u,p you're holding up the leader now.
Eric (as Mantis): Ay let me go, I’m gonna be late!
Julia (as Val): No.
Eric (as Mantis): Damn, I thought that would work!
Julia (as Val): You’re not very good at talking, not gonna lie to you.
Eric: Okay so let's go back to the under the boathouse you know Aggie you—
Amanda: [singing] Under the boathouse, boathouse!
Eric: [singing] Where there's a monster there under the boathouse!
Julia: [singing quietly] Boathouse!
Amanda: Exactly!
Eric: So yeah Aggie you are now you're face to face with this giant mountain lobster and—
Amanda: Aggie’s enamoured it's every childhood myth come true it's lovely, I love this mountain lobster.
Eric: Yeah Milo, so you come down the stairs, there is a granola bar floating in a above ground— sorry a half eaten granola bar floating an above-ground pool with a giant crayfish/mountain lobster eating with it's like noodley mouth just slopin’ all over this thing.
Amanda: I turn around and point at Milo and say
Amanda (as Aggie): Be cool man!
Brandon (as Milo): [extremely nervous] Uhhh okay, I can be cool when there's a giant lobster in an above-ground swimming pool. Which is a choice, in front of me. Did you have the other half of the granola bar? Did you I split it like what is happening?
Amanda (as Aggie): I made a little peace offering I don't want to think that I'm like these assholes who probably like poke it with wires or some shit.
Brandon (as Milo): Do you know if it has allergies?! There could be nuts in that bar!
Amanda (as Aggie): I think I think the shellfish is gonna be okay.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay.
Julia: It's like one of those situations where the allergies kind of contradict each other because he is a shellfish he no longer is allergic to anything else.
[Julia and Amanda laughing]
Eric: The giant crayfish is just gonna slosh in the water a little bit. Not much movement possible but now it's looking at Milo.
Brandon (as Milo): Hi!
Eric: And it goes
Eric (as mountain lobster): [high pitched raspberry noise]
Brandon (as Milo): Hello! [Stammering] You look great!
Amanda (as Aggie): Milo I'm sorry if this is not really— Milo I’m sorry if this is a little bit direct but any of your ghostly shit, could you like commune with animals or something? Because I would love to know what they've been doing to this creature and where it's from so we can return it.
Brandon (as Milo): I mean else I might have a veterinarian within me I don't know!
Amanda (as Aggie): It's a poetic way of putting it.
Brandon (as Milo): Let me see if Tuna can can do something. Uhh T-Tuna! [whistles] here, here!
Eric: Tuna then appears just on your face.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay that's not what I wanted can you get off my face please, please move adjacent either on my shoulder or off me completely.
Eric (as Tuna): No.
Brandon (as Milo): Cool, great, um turn around there's a giant mountain lobster behind you.
Eric (as Tuna): I like it it looks like a new friend!
Brandon (as Milo): It is! Can you talk to it?
Eric (as Tuna): Uhh I mean I guess why you think all animals can talk to each other? Wow! Woooow, it's some assumptions to be making.
Brandon (as Milo): But can you?
Eric (as Tuna): I can, but just know that you make the assumption.
Brandon: Can I roll animal handling to see if I can get Tuna to talk to the lobster?
Eric: Yes that is a great idea.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Well I rolled a critical 1!
Eric: Oh bud.
Julia: You could’ve saved that for a good good wild magic roll.
Eric: Okay with a critical one, Tuna goes
Eric (as Tuna): Fine! I'll do it. because you like me, and because I like you, I'll do it for you.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh this is a real step in our relationship, I'm glad you finally admitted your feelings for me.
Eric: And Tuna stocks over to the above-ground pool and like chirps at the mountain lobster, you know like when cats go mrrp merrp mrrp. And the mountain lobster kind of bubbles back and Tuna goes mrrp mrrp merrrp, and then the mountain lobster’s like brrb brrb. And Tuna like like cats just like because they have nothing better to do they just kind of like swipe forward, and at that point the mountain lobster snaps and it reaches one of its claws out of the water and just kind of tries to come down on Tuna, and it busts through the above-ground pool the water kind of flushes everywhere there's a lot you have to imagine, there's a lot of water in this above-ground pool to fit this like the size of a Volkswagen bug.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna what did you do?! What did you say?!
Eric (as Tuna): I was trying to be myself and the water is just floods—
Brandon (as Milo): That makes sense!
Eric: Floods the entire lower level and then Aggie at this point you see that things are sparking, and you realize that those are the cables that are attached to things that are it's too dark down there to see but you see that they're sparking with the water getting in with all the where the surge protectors were going and things are just kind of like sparking and exploding and shorting out around you.
Amanda: I would definitely never the breaker box is. Can I turn it all off?
Eric: Yeah make a perception check!
Amanda: 17 + 4, 21.
Eric: Alright awesome so with the 21, yeah you know exactly where the breaker box is you can run over and turn it off.
Amanda: Yeah, it’s right by the bottom of the stairs and I just like hit it instinctively.
Eric: Nice yeah you slam all of them off and all the lights in the building go out, and at that point you hear more and [high pitched raspberries] and bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp. And the mountain lobsters making a break for it.
Brandon: Oh my god.
Eric: I want to confirm it because both of you this is a bungalow area, you are out on a lake and all the lights went out, it is totally dark.
Brandon (as Milo): Uhh should we bail?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah I feel like this nice friend will go home and maybe to Lake Champlain or to the lake right here and we'll figure out what to do tomorrow!
Brandon (as Milo): Yep I like that plan!
Eric: So I want you to know turning off the breaker box was great, everyone in the area didn't get electrocuted congratulations.
Amanda: Thank you so yeah you hear the I guess stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp [rasperry] and then like sploosh as the you assume that the giant mountain lobster dives into the inlet of historic Lake Town and swims away. So you know you're kind of like both of you are up to your shins in water it is pitch dark and Aggie again, you know that there was stuff in here that was attached to electronics that have shorted out because of the water.
Amanda: Yes I'm gonna pull my phone out of my jacket pocket and turn on the flashlight, and in just kind of like scanning around the room and seeing where the wires are attached is there like a hard drive I can grab, or like a device or something that's like relatively portable that I can grab as we head out?
Eric: Yeah I want both of you to make investigation checks a Milo, I'm gonna give you advantage.
Julia: I would also like to know if there is a mountain lobster shaped hole in the garage door now.
Amanda: Well if it's like sandy, it could probably go under—
Eric: Thank you oh my god, muah muah, thank you Julia! I forgot that it was a locked. So yeah and you can look up the the light of the moon is now coming through a giant mountain lobster shaped hole. Julia, bless, chef’s kiss.
Eric and Julia: Muah.
Eric: So now both of you make investigation checks Milo you get advantage.
Amanda: 18!
Brandon: I got 17.
Eric: Wonderful okay, what di you want to look for something to grab?
Amanda: Yeah I just wanna know why they were keeping this thing captive, so I don't know if they were like putting growth hormones in the water, or if they were monitoring it or doing other kind of like collecting energy somehow. So there's some kind of like box or vial of chemicals that will indicate what was happening I want to just grab the most suspicious or out of place looking thing on my way out.
Eric: Honestly Aggie I would say that on the wall there is a clipboard, and the clipboard has a feeding schedule on it great let's grab it so you can examine that more so later but that's what you what you find with an 18. 17 for Milo!
Brandon: Yeah I'm gonna look for what Tuna said smelled like my job.
Eric: Bang-bang that's exactly what I was gonna tell you. Yes you're kind of like rooting around you're trying not to touch electrical equipment, cause you know that's bad regardless and I think that you smell something that smells exactly like when you went into the pod. And I think that there is like a bag of to go along with what Aggie found there's like a plastic bag filled with for lack of a better word dog kibble.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: And it smells like the inside of the pod.
Brandon: Hmm I'm gonna take that
Eric: Mmhm.
Brandon: Not eat it,
Eric: Smart!
Amanda: And then I think we both head up the stairs to meet up with Val.
Eric: Wonderful alright, so Val you are now grappling this guy the goon is gonna try to run in, and tackle you so that you who you are ungrappling. So he's gonna do an attack to you, and then I'm gonna see how bad it is and if you drop your grapple. So let's do an attack, so he's just like he's gonna run at you and just spear tackle you.
Julia: Sure, bring it on.
Eric: So he's now hopped into the ice cream truck as well and just is trying to spear tackle you, but just kind of like only does arms and falls off of you so you don't take any damage. The other guy's gonna try to break out.
Julia: Okay I have to do a strength saving insight?
Eric: Yeah.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: So did he by any chance beat a 23?
Eric: Yeah I rolled the natural 20 bud.
[Collective oh no]
Eric: Okay so you see that he's like trying to wiggle his way out and you just can't hold on to his arms he wiggled into his pockets and he zaps you with something. So he goes and your grapple has now have released him.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So he's gonna try to start this ice cream truck, and now the ice cream truck is moving.
Julia: This is gonna be bad. Alright.
Eric: So at this point Aggie and Milo you've run around and you see that inside of this ice cream truck, is a big goon, Val, and this smaller leader guy who's driving the ice cream truck.
Brandon (as Milo): What is Val doing?!
Eric (as goon): They're being a real pain in my ass! Let's say that much!
Julia: I want to push him out of the truck.
Eric: Okay that would be an attack, it would be a shove attack.
Julia: Yes I'm gonna reckless attack.
Eric: Okay.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Alright that's way better, that is a 23 again.
Eric: Okay with the 23, yeah you’re going up to shove the leader, but again now one of his goons is right next to him so he grabs another one and they say
Eric (as Mantis): Protect me!
Eric: And now you’re kicking you, just kick the other goon out of the ice cream truck.
Julia: Val’s gonna look at the guy who is remaining, the leader and be like
Julia (as Val): Look at me, look at me.
Eric (as Mantis): NO I’M DRIVING!
Julia (as Val): Look at me this is not gonna end well for you, you got no more goons between us!
Eric (as Mantis): That's fine! I can take care of things myself.
Eric: And he takes other thing that zapped you, and it is and it's very similar to the futuristic style like comic book style the laser gun that was in the cannon and now but it's like small, it has a chunky muzzle for zapping.
Julia: Val goes
Julia (as Val): What you think ya better than me? I’ve handled something like that before.
Eric (as Mantis): Oh you think you've never been zapped befor? I could zap people whatever I want!
Julia (as Val): [nonchalantly] I've been zapped before.
Eric (as Mantis): Oh okay I bet you've been zapped before.
Julia: I want to roll an intimidation check against him.
Eric: Yeah, sure go ahead.
Julia: Just to see if I could I don't know give him disadvantage or something in attacks.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: That's not good though, that’s a 9.
Eric: Yeah you do not intimidate him. Because he threatens that we you with the laser gun again and be like
Eric (as Mantis): Oh I could zap you again, I bet you would like that!
Julia (as Val): Let's try it.
Eric (as Mantis): With your weird vibrating and all that other shit I don't like it.
Julia (as Val): You shouldn't.
Amanda: Can we get in on this? Can I shoot a bunch of darts at the tires?
Eric: Yeah do it!
Julia: Hell yeah!
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 13 +5, 18.
Eric: Yeah roll damage.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Eric and I also cast entangle?
Eric: Oh that's a good idea!
Amanda: Yeah bud!
Eric: Yeah what do you do, what damage do you do to the tire?
Amanda: I got 7. But I can also do two attacks so let me do it again.
Eric: Yeah let's do the attacks now, and then we'll see how easy it is for you to entangle.
Amanda: Alright and then the next attack is a 12 to hit.
Eric: A 12, that does not hit.
Amanda: Okay so the first one I did 7 damage.
Eric: Okay wonderful, Brandon do your entangle!
Brandon: Okay yeah so I see that Aggie sends some attacks over to the ice cream truck and my brain kind of goes blank and I'm like
Brandon (as Milo): God I this needs to like stay still, and everything needs to stop.
Brandon: And the hand comes out of my chest and then shadow hands come up from the ground and grab onto the ice cream truck and—
Amanda: Yeaaaah!
Brandon: You must succeed on a strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling hands until the spell ends.
Eric: What do I need a roll?
Brandon: You gotta beat a 13,
Eric: I did not beat a 13.
[Amanda and Julia cheering]
Eric: Okay so Aggie yeah, you throw the dart and it pops the back left tire and now the grasping hands are coming out of just holding it in place. This guy is just stepping as hard as he can on the gas.
Eric (as Mantis): No no no no no no!
Amanda: I'll use a ki point to step of the wind right up next to him like quicker than his eye can even process, and just grab him by the neck.
Julia: Then Val just goes
Julia (as Val): I'm so sick of this guy talking, just please knock him out.
Amanda: Yeah I'll use another ki point, and make two unarmed strikes.
Eric: Do it!
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 24, does that hit?
Eric: That does hit.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: And then 19.
Eric: That does hit.
Amanda: Great.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: That is a 11 damage.
Eric: Okay yeah no you have more people and go pah-pah-pah and he's not down but I think he's pretty caught, so—
Amanda: I pull him out of the truck so he can’t keep driving.
Eric: And you pull him out of the truck, okay yeah! So we're not fighting anymore. I think you've pulled him out of the truck successfully, and now he's just standing on kind of this dirt road that's try to lead out from the main lake area. Milo you’ve caught up as well so all three are you standing at around him.
Amanda: I’m gonna zip tie his hands together.
Eric (as Mantis): Oh this hurts, this hurts everywhere. Why did you punch me I'm just a defenseless nineteen year old.
Julia: That's absolutely untrue.
Eric (as Mantis): What do you mean?
Brandon (as Milo): Nineteen in high school?!
Eric (as Mantis): No, you know I dropped out, I have my GED.
Julia (as Val): You had I assume a bunch of contraband in the basement? Yeah?
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh it was straight up Monty.
Julia (as Val): W-what what? I'm sorry?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah it was Monty, you know the lobster?
Amanda (as Aggie): No it was a giant lobster, what the fuck were you doing?
Eric (as Mantis): That’s not Monty, Monty doesn't exist Monty’s a myth.
Amanda (as Aggie): Are you trying to make it exist?
Eric (as Mantis): I don't know what you're talking about!
Amanda (as Aggie): How did you get the giant mountain lobster then?
Eric (as Mantis): There was no giant mountain lobster down there, I don't know what you're talking about.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay so what was all that dog food for?
Amanda: And I point over.
Eric (as Mantis): For our dogs, obviously we have three.
Brandon (as Milo): There were no dogs! They ran away cause you broke in!
Eric: At this point you here vroom vrooom
Julia (as Val): Oh this mother fucker again?
Eric: Pulling up on the road is the Knight of Mirrors, with a college student with a man bun and a patchy beard.
Julia (as Val): I fucking saw you River Greens!
[Amanda laughing]
Eric (as River): Shit how do you know my name!? Fuck! Damn, don’t tell my RA.
Eric: And then the Knight of Mirrors says
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): [With a robotically distorted voice] Oh I thought you lost this so I brought it back for ya!
Julia (as Val): The teenager?
Amanda (as Aggie): You seem great but you're always too late.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Listen, you can’t be everywhere, I just have a motorcycle I'm doing my best.
Amanda (as Aggie): This— who is this kid?!
Julia (as Val): Yes, what, why did you bring me this child?
Brandon (as Milo): Who are you?!
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): This is my good friend River Greens, he had his phone out the entire time!
Eric: And you see that River then like puts his phone sideways and hits a button and then it projects up and it has a video of Val beating the crap out of these children.
Julia (as Val): Were you fucking live streaming this shit I swear to God!
Eric: And just like all the really cool stuff that Val did also mostly the stuff that was in the outside that what Val was doing. Nothing on the video was of the mountain lobster, it was kind of like everything in the parking lot.
Eric (as River): Listen I'm I just wanted to— I just came in how he said that you were doing all these lies but I have video of it. You were defending me! He was coming— I bet that the ice cream truck was coming right at me!
Amanda (as Aggie): Why were you filming this?
Eric (as River): Well you know to put on Instagram!
Julia (as Val): Please, please, please, please—
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I think what the kind, college student citizen is trying to say, is that they would corroborate your story. There's obviously some bad stuff happening here—
Amanda (as Aggie): To who?!
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): We can get the police here and take them down!
Amanda: Okay…
Julia (as Val): I mean a bunch of people did like punch us and also try to feed you to a giant mountain lobster?
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay! Let's get out of the middle of the road everybody, meet me at number 80 Lake Shore Drive right now.
Julia (as Val): Could I have a ride?
Eric (as Mantis): Does that include me should I also go there?
Julia (as Val): Yes!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yes! You’re zip-tied and I’m holding your wrists. Let's go.
Julia (as Val): Do you want me to carry him back? He seems like a pain in the ass.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yes, please.
Brandon: Are there any leftover tacos?
Julia: Probably.
Amanda: I don’t think we had any leftovers.
Brandon: That’s true.
Julia: We ate them while we were snoopin’.
Amanda: But I do pull a quiche out of the freezer.
Eric: Wonderful okay so River Greens is riding on the back of the Knight of Mirrors’ motorcycle. Do you have a porch?
Amanda: Yeah I have like a little trellis with like vines over it in the back of the house that's like on a patio.
Eric: Cool oh yeah I think that everyone pulls back there cause the Knight of Mirrors is like
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Sorry, I'm on duty, I can't come in and eat now. But thank you so much, but we can talk out here.
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh sure.
Julia (as Val): Weird politeness…
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah so can we like can we send the civilian onto the patio with somebody? Val would you look after these bronies for a second?
Julia: Val just like looks at Mantis or whatever the fuck his name is, and is like
Julia (as Val): You! Cover your ears.
Eric: Yeah that's fine, that’s totally fine.
Julia: Intimidation check!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: That’s a 14.
Eric: Sure I think with a 14, you've thoroughly beaten this man up like hey 18 year-old, watch this 19 year-old!
Eric: River will watch, I will tell you as the DM, River will watch over Mantis, and you won't have a problem.
Amanda: Yeah just stand at the end of the driveway where it's like fenced it and nothing’s gonna happen.
[Crickets chirping outside]
Amanda (as Aggie): I really have to know who you are, and what you're doing here? What are you doing? Do you know Emily?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Tell me which order I should answer these questions and I will!
Amanda (as Aggie): The order I gave it to you, thank you,
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): One at a time, you asked me a lot of things in a row!
Amanda (as Aggie): What’s your name?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I am the Knight of Mirrors.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay what's your civilian name?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I am not at liberty to tell that to you.
Amanda (as Aggie): So what are you doing here?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I am here to I look — listen, do I look like the police? I honestly—
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah! You kinda look like a future cop!
Julia (as Val): Yeah, a little fuckin bit!
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Oh I should work on my— is it which of my mirrors is the thing that makes you think I’m police?
Julia (as Val): It's really just your whole vibe.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): I have to say that if you don't give us any other information we're forced to conclude what we will which is that you are some kind of future Robocop here to, I don't know shut down the crimes that you think are bad and let the ones that you think are good keep going.
Julia (as Val): You know like in an 80’s movie.
Amanda (as Aggie): Like that.
Eric: The Knight shifts on their bike and says
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): It sounds like I'm a lot like you, I'm not affiliated with police. I'm just trying to help out wherever I can, it sounds like what we do is a little bit different than other people. Pretty coo, pretty neat I would say. Good job everybody. I’, just out here trying to save stuff and I have this cool motorcycle.
Julia (as Val): There is a difference between you and us though and it's that we're not wearing a weird mask thing.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): You should think about it, I know where your house is, might be bad.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah because we're community members…
Brandon (as Milo): Is that a threat?!
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Not a threat! More like if you can trust me because I am a good person and I beat up bad guys, but let's say there are many reasons why people put on masks, one is people don't need to know who you are. That is my reason, and that's why I put on masks, that's why I have big helmet on. You see big helmet? I wear big helmet so no one knows who I am.
Julia (as Val): Yeah we got that part. That's why we think you are not trustworthy—
Amanda (as Aggie): And maybe it's suspicious when somebody has no stakes and no ties to the community that they're going around doing reflective tricks in,
Julia (as Val): And also keep showing up in places that we are also causing not trouble at, trouble is the wrong word.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Who says is trouble with capital T and that rhymes with P and stands for pool.
Julia (as Val): Go fuck yourself.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): See, I know musicals! I’m a real person under here, I promise.
Amanda (as Aggie): And maybe we’d trust you a little more if you told us you know who you are so we're all on the same foot here!
Brandon (as Milo): Maybe you take off your helmet and we'll trust you.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I can’t do that, that sounds like a bad idea for me and only good for you, but I can say you can't trust me. I like fighting bad guys I can tell you everything about my setup. I have a cool CB radio where I've hacked into the police radio waves.
Amanda (as Aggie): So someone knows what went on at the boat house or you just saw this clear idiot walking through the forest?
Julia (as Val): On your motorcycle.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Well, I can tell you why I'm here. It sounds like there was a half-baked plan to get the guys who robbed the bank auction out of jail. It seems like there was supposed to be two ice cream trucks, but there was only one ice cream truck, and when that ice-cream truck ran up on the armored vehicle taking the shrimp boys from one place to another place it didn't go nearly as well. Especially because there was a flying guy and a lady with a purple sword who really thwarted everybody.
Julia (as Val): Oh man, they really fucked that up, good for them.
Amanda (as Aggie): Aw man, nice. Cool.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): So I kind of put everything together, especially after I tracked down that ice cream truck that almost ran over you two. Or did it run over you?
Julia (as Val): It did run over—
Amanda (as Aggie): Semi ran over.
Brandon (as Milo): Not this guy I didn't—
Julia (as Val): Well congratulations Milo you didn't get hit by a truck.
Brandon (as Milo): Thank you.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I can run over you make even if that's the thing that you want.
Brandon (as Milo): I would not like that…
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): That’s fair. That's only fair. So I want you to know, I'm on your side and I won't even say that I was here so that you guys get all the credit.
Amanda (as Aggie): Don't want any credit, at all.
Julia (as Val): Do not want credit.
Amanda (as Aggie): Want negative credit.
Julia (as Val): Want no police interviewing me, and asking me questions about anything really.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Okay so I will take should — I take that I want to do whatever you all do think should I take all the credit?
Julia: And Val is going to like one moment please and then walk everyone
Julia (as Val): So like here's the thing—
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Whatever you want, reall! I'm totally fine with it!
Julia (as Val): Vigilantism, illegal.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah could just blame it all on this dude and still like—
Brandon (as Milo): I have a job I have to keep.
Julia (as Val): Exactly I have many jobs—
Eric: Who's gonna want a dog walker who's also a crime fighter?
Julia (as Val): What I'm saying is we can just pawn it off on this idiot because they don't have a face and the police can’t interview them or whatever, and then we still do the thing that Emily wanted us to do.
Amanda (as Aggie): Here's my thing, being able to take small mountain lobsters and make them giant mountain lobsters is not a good thing, and I feel like either this person is responsible for it or they need to know about it so everyone cool if I call Dr. Morrow?
Brandon (as Milo): Absolutely!
Julia (as Val): You just have Dr. Morrow’s number?
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh yeah, you know I like coordinated a festival for them a few years ago.
Julia (as Val): That is fuckin’ wild, alright.
Eric: You keep an eye on Mantis he's like walking around and he picks up a photo and it's a photo of you and Dr. Morrow at a Jazz Festival like Lake Town City Jazz Festival 2015.
Eric (as Mantis): Why didn't I go, I should’ve gone to that.
Brandon (as Milo): Aggie, can we meet the doctor?
Amanda (as Aggie): We're gonna have a long discussion about boundaries and professional you know, appearances before we do so.
Julia (as Val): But also, you just fuckin’ know the mayor so I would also like to meet the mayor at some point.
Brandon (as Milo): They’re my hero!
Amanda: Cool so I think the Knight should— that is such a ridiculous name.
Julia (as Val): It’s so fucking dumb.
Amanda (as Aggie): I think they should drop off the college kid, they should put this jamoke in front of the police station if they're not dealing with the jailbreak thing and we’ll tell them not to say anything, but if they do—
Julia (as Val): Okay just tell River greens I know his name, I know where he lives, I know what dorm he's in.
Amanda: So I'll sort of nod and pull my phone out and then walk back over to the Knight and say
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen, you don't have to make a big thing of this but if you want to take the perp, see crime language I'm one of you, over to the police station and drop them off. I think they'll know what to do.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Yeah absolutely, I will do exactly what you tell me to do because we're on the same side!
Julia (as Val): And you should definitely tell the police everything that you did tonight! Wink.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): What did I do exactly just so I can have my story straight.
Brandon: While we're saying this to him I want to take out my phone I need to start audio or video, I wanna start video recording this because I don't trust this Knight of Mirrors, and I want to have something on tape in case they decide to go back on their word.
Eric: Okay make a stealth roll.
Brandon: Yeah.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: It went on the floor but is an 18 +2for 20!
Julia: Nice!
Eric: Okay I would say that with the 20 you can very easily surreptitiously audio record with video recording, it would literally still look like you're holding your phone so I would give you if you just want to straight up audio record I'll give you that.
Brandon: Yeah I'll do that.
Eric: Okay cool yeah you can do and record on your phone no problem so then the Knight syas
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): So what did you all what did you all agree on?
Amanda (as Aggie): So listen you should take the perp to the police station, I think they'll just know what to do they'll see the semi explosion that happened over at the boathouse put two and two together. But I need your phone number we need to be able to meet and talk about stuff so—
Julia (as Val): At least your What’sApp or something like that.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I have a signal so that no one can hack into my stuff.
Amanda (as Aggie): Annoying, whatever fine.
Amanda: And I hand them my phone.
Eric: And they go boopity boopity boop, then you now can contact the Knight of Mirrors.
Julia (as Val): Also when the police ask you, you did beat up a bunch of high schoolers, and this guy.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Fair, okay, okay.
Julia (as Val): They were holed up in the boathouse, was there anything else we need them to take the fall for?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): It’s more credit honestly, people are gonna be super stoked about this. I just wanna be really clear.
Amanda (as Aggie): Are you from here?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Yeah! No I oooh, oh, no you…
Amanda (as Aggie): Anyway…
Julia (as Val): Aggie knows everyone.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): I care about this city a lot, and I like living here.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, whatever, we'll text. Val you want to take care of the kid in the tuxedo shirt?
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Should I tell River delete the video?
Amanda and Julia (as Aggie and Val): Yes!
Julia (as Val): I will talk to River.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Do you want that? Because it seems pretty neat.
Julia (as Val): No, I would prefer not because I know a lot of people who can get a lot of information and things about me and I don't want more information and things on the Internet. Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): No problem, I’ll tell River to delete it.
Julia (as Val): Alright great,
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): No problem.
Amanda (as Aggie): Alright let's all get some sleep and let's text we'll see how things shake out tomorrow.
Eric (as Knight of Mirrors): Alright, have fun, I will take all the credit for the cool thing that you did by fighting crime bye!
Amanda (as Aggie): Good for you bud.
Eric: VROOOM!! And there's a side car pops out and they throw the Mantis, the leader in there and River is holding onto the Knight of Mirrors from behind.
Julia: Val goes as they drive away
Julia (as Val): I know where you live River Greens
Eric (as River): Oh damn, fuck!
Amanda: So in the wake of that I think the three of us are just standing in my driveway and I kind of gesture everybody up into the house and I'm gonna call Dr. Morrow.
Eric: Okay you go into your contacts and you hit Dr. Momorrow's name, you hear ring ring ring and picks up and this is the voice of Dr. Morrow that says
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): Aggie I don't remember the last time that we talked on the telephone hello!
Amanda (as Aggie): Kind of an emergency, I'm gonna get right to the point. Are you growing super mountain lobsters? Or know someone who is?
Eric (as Dr. Morrow): [after a beat] alright I thought this was going to be a boring phone call…

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time, on Join the Party…
Eric: Aggie Val and Milo run an obstacle course to be on Emily slaughters crime-fighting squad with some quick thinking a bunch of luck and picking Milo up when his legs didn't work all three made it to the end and a fast after the trial Milo traded Emily his $10,000 payout for one of dr. marrows emergency science keys to open the weird pod in the bottom of the museum and an ice cream truck tried to run over Val and Aggie in the warehouse parking lot with Val taking the majority of the hit but scraping off some paints to recognize the truck in the future you know we might have hit a rocky road this is no vanilla story with swirls of mystery and intrigue… Uh… Um, sherbert, let's get the party started.
[Theme music]
Eric: Much like any good Friday night, you are walking away from a warehouse in the hipster district.
Brandon: You fundamentally misunderstand how we spend our Friday nights, Eric.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: You are not misunderstanding how Val spends their nights.
Amanda: Brandon it's more like if you and I like stopped at a sample sale for linens on our way home at 5:30.
Brandon: Oh yeah, the nest sample sale.
Amanda: Yes and then someone elbowed you and you're like ow and then you walk home and you get home at 6:30 in you're HOO what a night!
Julia: Yeah that's like getting hit by a truck in a warehouse.
Brandon: I get it, I get it. Thank you.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Okay the real power fantasy is that Brandon and Amanda's characters stay out past 10:00.
Julia: Let’s be real, it’s also mine.
Eric: Alright so you all uh you all head home I think at one point you see Emily walk out and grab an Uber.
Amanda: Of course, classic Emily.
Julia: Fuckin’ asshole. We have perfectly good public transport in the city we created.
Eric (as Emily): I 50 percent off I use it all the time, I don't know why they keep giving it to me.
Julia (as Val): It's like two dollars to take the skytram!
Brandon (as Milo): It's less it's like seventy five cents because we live in an actually good city.
Julia: Oh, sorry we do, it’s true.
Eric: It's only $2.
Amanda: Subsidized monthly passes oh so good.
Eric: Alright so you all head home we're gonna start with Val! So Val it's still that night and you're heading home walking up to your apartment we’ve talked about the fact that you have like a shitty apartment but only nice things inside yeah tell me more about that.
Julia: So Val obviously is a adult human so they rent their own apartment—
Brandon: Sounds suspicious sure…
Julia: They were at their own apartment and you know they don't make a lot of money in the side hustles that they do and stuff so that's the kind of place they can afford is like a little studio apartment above the pizzeria the nice things are all gifts from family members.
Amanda: Oooh!
Julia: So Eric mentioned four poster beds yeah poster bed.
Amanda: Do you have like a full bedroom set and like that's all your furniture?
Julia: Basically and there's like a lot of really good kitchen stuff like high-quality cappuccino maker, and full like enamelware like the expensive kind of it enamelware.
Amanda: Oh yeah like vintage Pyrex that isn't expensive but just like is old.
Julia: And all their clothes, and then their grandma's tin saucepot obviously.
Amanda: Awww.
Brandon: I love that.
Eric: It's just like a crappy apartment and then Anthropology just like vomited through the entire apartment.
Julia: Yes!
Eric: Here's the question I was mulling around in my head how do they know what you want? In my head it's like you could just keep updating an Amazon wishlist or just like you have an open like Evernote document or an open Google Doc where you just like put links in and then you just cross them out and replace them.
Julia: I think it's less that and more like private Pinterest board that someone has access to and now to certainly ask for anything they just kind of like pin something or they like something on Instagram and then like a week later there's an Amazon package at the door or something like that.
Eric: I like that that you're not even doing it intentionally you just do it and then through phone calls or through social media.
Julia: It’s very passive.
Eric: It’s super funny!
Brandon: Does it always smell like delicious yeast in the like rising bread in the apartment?
Julia: Nah I think it's always a little bit of a scent of cooked onions and garlic little bit of basil in the air. I kind of imagined—
Amanda: A lil’ tomato acidity.
Julia: Val is not like a particularly good gardener or anything like that but there's a basil plant that they have kept alive for like years.
Amanda: Yeaaah!!
Julia: And that is always available!
Amanda: A vigorous grower!
Julia: They’re very hard to kill, these plants. Definitely a housewarming gift from their mom.
Eric: If it's fall 2020 what do you think Val wants now?
Julia: I think that their Instagram like they've been checking the apartment hashtag a bit and it's a lot of like nice duvet covers for like when the seasons are changing.
Amanda: A little flannel maybe?
Julia: Yeah a little bit of flannel like like a good solid blanket for the couch that kind of thing.
Brandon: I want to live in this apartment!
Eric: I like maybe if the company was called like Goose Gown but its Gooosse Dwn and they move the O forward so it's Goosedon.
[Everyone starts repeating Goodsedon]
Jula: That sounds like everybody’s saying gustin weird.
Eric: That's great, so yeah, you're coming home it's like 11:30 midnight and you're heading up to your apartment and there's a big box in the hallway.
Julia: Yeah par for the course so Val kind of unlocks the door nudges it open with their foot and then kind of drags it back into the apartment.
Eric: Right and you of course you need to avoid the beautiful coat rack that is next to your door.
Julia: I'm so gaudy.
Amanda: Sought iron!
Eric: So you have your big box and yeah you're in your apartment.
Julia: Alright, I throw my stuff down, I check my phone to see if I have any jobs for tomorrow, which I do I have like a notification about moving someone from like one house in Weston to another house in Weston.
Amanda: Classic Weston,
Julia: Val does like a man with a van kind of thing but whatever the like gender-neutral version of that is.
Amanda: A person with a cushion, capabilities a ramp into my car.
Brandon: Person with car.
Julia: Yeah, basically that so they're gonna probably sometime tomorrow morning go and work that job. Then I'll open up the package and see what's up.
Eric: Alright so it's in the patented grey purple Gooosse Dwn box you pop it open and there is this beautiful mechanically created hypoallergenic down blanket in there.
Julia: Nice, I pull the one from last season off the couch and throw this one on istead.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Great alright so as you pull it out you hear like crunching—
Brandon: It’s full of goose bones!
Eric: [Extremely sarcastic] Yes Brandon, yeah you're right, it was goose bones. Well alright Val we're gonna go move on in the next scene alright.
Julia: Alright, so they'll kick the box the same noise.
Eric: Yeah it's like somebody's rattling around the box.
Julia: They check the bottom of the box.
Eric: Okay so in the bottom of the box covering the entire bottom of this big box there's dried macaroni—
Julia: Okay.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: And there is a manila envelope alright so in the manila envelope.
[Amanda laughs again]
Julia: God dammit, alright. They open the manilla envelope.
Eric: You see that there’s photos taken of you with a briefcase attached to your wrist—
Amanda: Noooooo!
Eric: Now it seems from an angle you can see that's taken from high up so it could've been a security camera. I don’t know, you weren't really looking so maybe it's a security camera up there. There's one of you just kicking some goons asses and then there's ones of you walking down the hallway to the auctioneer and the banker’s office, and then there's another one of the other room in that room of you making the handoff and then you leave.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: And then you see there's the auctioneer opening up that big duffel bag briefcase, and you see him pull out all the money, and the final shot is him holding what looks like an oversized laser cannon.
Brandon: Ooohhh.
Julia: Great.
Eric: Have you ever seen you know when there's like a SWAT team and they have like the personal sized battering ram?
Julia: Yeah, exactly.
Eric: You know what I’m talking about?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah, like it's like a battering ram with two handles that one person can use. It looks like that, but there's like all—
Amanda: An apartment-sized battering ram!
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: A personal pan battering ram.
Brandon: Buttery crust!
Amanda: That’s like a great gift for Val, I dunno what you’re talking about?
Eric: But of course it has a laser opening and it still has these blue glowing thing and I want you to make an investigation check.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: Is that a 0? Or a 1?
Julia: That is a nat 20.
Eric: Bang bang!
Amanda and Brandon: Ayyy!
Eric: Alright so here is the weird thing you know it's a laser cannon because like it is iridescent and weird and glowing blue. Especially like if you know how a gun has a muzzle, but if it's a laser cannon and it just has like kind of an opening on the front but like—
Julia: I know all about laser cannons.
Eric: It is very science fictiony it's like neo futuristic and it's like also comic-bookish it's like this white gold sort of shiny metal and that core is blue and there's like a weird fin on top, and you realized with a nat 20, that this looks very similar to the technology that the Nephews had. Like they have their electrified sticks there were also very strange, they're like billy clubs that were like electrified and also futuristic, that jetpack although yabby didn't know how to fly it it, was also like very like a futuristic comic-book kind of version of what a jetpack could look like in a cyberpunk 90’s sort of style.
Julia: Okay probably not the first time someone's blackmailed me before—
[Brandon Laughing]
Eric: I would also say with a nat 20 you check on the macaroni, pop it in your mouth crunch it, and you have an immediate flashback to when you were 9 and you were at your dad's mom's house. You're like I know what this pasta tastes like.
Amanda: Ohhhhhhhh!
Julia: Yeah, I had a feeling…
Amanda: Val is a bloodhound of Italian goods!
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Dried and sundries!
Eric: I would also say within at 20 your dad is Marco Marconi aka The Macaroni who is a Capo in the New York City mob and how high up is that capo?
Julia: So there's the boss and the boss has the Consigliere which is like the advisor and Capo's are the bosses under the bosses, so he's an underboss so he would have his own crews and stuff like that, that worked different jobs and whatnot and they pay up to the Capo which then pays up to the boss.
Brandon: So I am just picturing you waking up one day and in your bed there's just like pasta [Brandon and Amanda laughing]
Julia: Listen, dad’s gotta signature.
Amanda: That's funny because I was picturing Cate Blanchett playing a mob boss and then some kind of like bando style tuxedo and it's called the Underboob Underboss—
Julia: So hot!
Amanda: So that's just where I was at for a minute.
Julia: I’m here for it.
Brandon: Two different things, both equally good.
Eric: Both of equal stature yeah is there anything that wants to do?
Julia: What time is it?
Eric: Midnightish.
Julia: Val's gonna take some leftover sauce that's in their fridge and is gonna make some pasta.
Eric: Absolutely.
Julia: Also takes a picture of it and sends it to their dad.
Amanda: Oooohhh.
Eric: You get no response because your dad goes to sleep at like 8:30.
Julia: It’s like midnight, I want him to wake up to it.
Eric: That's good, I feel like we end if you look at the comic book is like the panel is just Val making pasta. Alright we're gonna go to Milo! So Milo this is the next day everybody you all take your full sleep so y'all do your long rests you all get your HP and your spells back. It is Saturday but I assume that the museum is still open on a Saturday. I literally DM’d you and I'm like oh it's Saturday I'm like wait you work at a museum you have weird hours.
Brandon: Yeah it was weird at 2:00 a.m. I got a dm from Eric it was like [yelling] “WHAT ARE THE HOURS?!”
Eric: Okay, first of all it was like 2:00 P.M. we were at work, that’s not what happened. Is Milo gonna make it to work on time today?
Brandon: I think so cause it's Saturday so for whatever reason even though he has to work it's like less stressful, you know? The world seems less stressful.
Eric: I think it's like the fact that you go to work even though the sky tram doesn't run, maybe as frequently it's just not rush hour I think that's also nice.
Brandon: Yeah but because we're living in a a great city with actually good transportation there’s still — there's no delays there's still trains every—
Eric: It just might be less frequent but it's still working yeah so you head on in to MMFFC, and at this point you see your best friend Lucas is standing out front. We talked about this and Milo has friends—
Amanda: WHAT?!
Eric: But Milo has been running late every time so you haven't been able to introduce them so Lucas also works with you at MMFFC. He is like an archivist there and he's holding a bag of donuts for you.
Brandon: [gasps] YES! Yeah, every other time Lucas has been already in the archives because I've shown up 15 minutes late.
Eric: Exactly.
Brandon: Right.
Brandon (as Milo): Lucas! Are those small donuts? Are those the tiny ones?
Eric (as Lucas): You know listen, why did we spend two whole days trying all the different kinds of don't if now we don't know which is the best doughnuts and now I'm gonna get them for you.
Brandon (as Milo): Man, I miss college.
Julia: Your friends are so nerdy bro.
Eric (as Lucas): Uh Milo, we did this last week…
Brandon (as Milo): We didn't go to college together.
Eric (as Lucas): No we didn't go to grow up together. I mean you can still miss it, I just was not there. Now your life is significantly better.
Brandon (as Milo): It is cause I got tiny doughnuts in my life now!
Eric (as Lucas): There ya go man! Anything happen, anything weird happen while you were running late and I was doing my job?
[Amanda laughing]
Julia: Sick burn.
Brandon (as Milo): Rude.
Eric (as Lucas): Fair, that’s why you like me.
Brandon (as Milo): I mean you heard about the auction right?
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah dude where that was I've heard through the grapevine that you’d tell everyone you weren't there.
Brandon (as Milo): I was there I just yeah I was there trying to get the thing for Mr. Bossman
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, okay but like nothing else nothing else? Nothing else weird happened?
Brandon (as Milo): No I mean it got robbed and I ran away.
Eric (as Lucas): Oh, okay…
Brandon (as Milo): That was weird.
Eric: Lucas takes out his phone and he shows you a screenshot which has like the impact font meme that'd be like I shot a ghost out of my body and then I pooped my pants.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric (as Lucas): Oh so I just oh yeah I must have photoshopped this by myself?
Julia: Can I have a ghost hand?
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda: I can has ghost hand?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah it's weird that you spent the time to photoshop this together and get tiny doughnuts?
Eric: Mm-hmm yeah, that's true okay that's fine. Whatever you wanna tell me or not tell me that's fine. I thought we were best friends but I guess we're not so… [sighs] Oh I guess I’m gonna have to go find a best friend to eat these doughnuts with. [sighs]
Eric: Then he walks away humming The Incredible Hulk theme song like the one with Lou Ferrigno.
Brandon: How's that one go?
[Eric starts singing the theme solemnly]
Julia: As he sadly walks down the road hitchhiking.
Eric: [Continues singing] Holding the donuts [more singing]
Brandon (as Milo): Lucas I want the donuts!
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah well you know I was gonna give it to my best friend but I guess I don't have one—
Brandon (as Milo): I’ve got something I got something for you.
Eric (as Lucas): Oh yeah?
Brandon: I take the key out of my pocket.
Eric (as Lucas): Ooh what is it?
Brandon (as Milo): It’s a science key!
Eric (as Lucas): You can't just say science on a thing and try to get me interested in it!
Brandon (as Milo): Yes I can you're a big big nerd.
Eric (as Lucas): Hurtful, fine, alright what is it what does it do? Why is it a science key?
Brandon (as Milo): Okay so you know that new exhibit that came into the museum?
Eric (as Lucas): What — no?
Brandon (as Milo): Weird pod thing a containment unit thing that came in! Did you not see this?
Eric (as Lucas): What? No!
Brandon (as Milo): Okay well there's a new pod thing that came in —
Eric (as Lucas): Alright, cool I guess?
Brandon (as Milo): and this is gonna it open it.
Eric (as Lucas): Alright let's go check it out!
Brandon (as Milo): You wanna see what's inside?
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah!
Brandon (as Milo): Let's do it!
Eric (as Lucas): Alright guess we are best friends even though you lied to me!
Eric: He’s running down the stairs.
Brandon (as Milo): CanI have the chocolate kind of blueberry ones?!
Eric (as Lucas): Only when you show me a cool thing!
Brandon (as Milo): I want to put the chocolate and blueberry ones ones together for —
Eric (as Lucas): [voice fading with distance] Ahh I can’t hear you!
Eric: So yeah now you and Lucas are in front of the pod.
Brandon: Okay!
Brandon (as Milo): Lucas are you ready?
Eric (as Lucas): Yeah! Ready for what?
Brandon (as Milo): Okay so I need you to do something.
Eric (as Lucas): Okay.
Brandon (as Milo): So I'm gonna need you to knock three times, spin around, and then chant “Open! Open! Open!” And I'll put the key in.
Eric (as Lucas): Fuck you not doing that do the thing. I'm already mad at you.
Brandon (as Milo): You did it last time.
Eric: Now he's just like slowly opening the bag and putting the doughnuts in his mouth.
Eric (as Lucas): Mmmmm it’s so good!
Eric: And he just pops one in his mouth.
Brandon (as Milo): [Muttering under his breath] I wanted some fucking doughnuts.
Eric (as Lucas): As soon as you show me something I'll do it. It's so good oh this one had cream inside didn't even know they made those!
Brandon (as Milo): [Still muttering[ Did you get the creme brulee ones?
Eric (as Lucas): [Taunting Milo] Oh let me look around oh I guess I only got one and I'm gonna put it in my mouth now!
Brandon (as Milo): Lucas I'm gonna put you in this casket…
Eric (as Lucas): No you're not show me science guy!
Brandon (as Milo): Are you coming on to me Lucas?
Brandon: I put the key into the casket.
Eric: What do you do? Just put it in?
Brandon: And turn it.
Eric: The reason why I asked it's funny is that you would assume you have to turn it but you literally just like put it in and then it like glows a little bit, then it's like
Eric (as casket): [Monotone voice] Emergency sequence activated.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh good!
Eric: The door goes [heavy door opening noise] and like smoke comes out —
Brandon: Super sciency!
Eric: Then Bigfoot walks out! The smoke comes out and you wait for a second Lucas says
Brandon (as Milo): Oooo ahhh! Lucas look, it’s empty!
Eric (as Lucas): It’s not — dog it's not empty…
Brandon (as Milo): What?
Eric: You look inside and there is a human skeleton inside.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh good lord! Okay—
Eric and Brandon (as Lucas and Milo): UHHHHHHHH!
Eric (as Lucas): Alriiiight.
Brandon (as Milo): Lucas go get the boss please!
Eric (as Lucas): Oh definitely bye bye!
Brandon (as Milo): Thank you!
Eric (as Lucas): I'm taking the doughnuts for safekeeping!
Brandon (as Milo): Please I lost my appetite!
Eric (as Lucas): Me too!
Eric: And then he reaches across and pops one into his mouth and walks over to get Mr. Brewpot.
Brandon (as Milo): You're a weirdo!
Eric (as Lucas): Brewpot! Brewski!
Eric: What do you think the spirits look like cause you have Tuna. But Tuna is just like an ethereal cat. What do you think a human spirit looks like?
Brandon: I think they're all different I think there are different shades of like transparency and like formess like materialness. I think the ones that like flow through me are not strong enough to make a form in the physical world right and so I'm like their conduit but the ones that can take form in the world are more corporeal.
Eric: I like that it's kind of like you know when you go you're in Photoshop and you put like the glow shadow behind them it might just be like that depending on how hard they can hold their form I like that. So stepping out you see there's a guy wearing a lab coat, he has big chunky glasses, and ratty jeans, and converse sneakers he's like
Eric (as spirit): Oh so you're the guy who saved me? Thanks dude!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah no problem!
Eric (as spirit): Okay well deuces!
Brandon (as Milo): Can you hold on one second?
Eric (as spirit): Oh yeah? Yeah! What's up?
Brandon (as Milo): Oh god where do I start? Uh one how? Two why? Three how am I talking to you? Four what are you gonna do next? Where did you come from? How was this science?
Eric (as spirit): Can you — well that was that was a lot of questions can you do those to me in order? I'll work through.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay, okay do you know how I'm talking to you?
Eric (as spirit): Well I assume I'm dead because bad things happened to me.
Brandon (as Milo): Right and that's your skeleton in there.
Eric (as spirit) Yeah in this thing.
Brandon (as Milo): Right sorry about that, was it painful?
Eric (as spirit): No it's kind of like that thing in Pokemon where you faint they like just everything kind of goes black and then eventually you see Nurse Joy and I didn't see Nurse Joy at the end but it's kind of just kind of —
Brandon (as Milo): I'm Nurse Joy whaddup!
Eric (as spirit): I hate it I hope not. It's kind like that.
Brandon (as Milo): What happened? How did you die?
Eric (as spirit): Uhh
Brandon (as Milo): Oh and what is this pod thing?
Eric (as spirit): Good these are all great questions! Uh,well, I was working on an experiment for Dr. Morrow and we were testing it, and I walked inside to see to tweak something and I guess something turned on and it locked and then that's kind of it. Then Pokemon fainting.
Brandon (as Milo): What were you testing?
Eric (as spirit): Oh yeah this pod! So you know —
Brandon (as Milo): Also your starting six?
Eric (as spirit): Listen, longer conversation than you have right now. Um so you know so you know in Pokemon when you give one of your characters like your starting six like a rare candy, or a special XP up, or one of those and it raises stats? Of course it's just with regular food like you kind of give them a lemonade and for some reason it raises HP or the berries. It’s kinda like that so there's an idea that maybe if we infuse something into actual food and we consume it then maybe things will be better! You'll be faster, you'll be stronger, or your level up in so many ways. Maybe you'll evolve even.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay, okay…Was any of a successful that you're aware of?
Eric (as spirit): Oh man, I mean we worked on I was working on it I was part of the pre team. I'm more of like I know we were all science guys but I was like a [adding emphasis] science guy. I was more theoretical and we had just started doing experimentation and then this all happened you know TPK man.
Brandon (as Milo): I'm sorry man…
Eric (as spirit): Total party kill…
Brandon (as Milo): Cool
[a beat passes]
Brandon (as Milo): Not that kind of nerd alright um…
Julia: I was going to ask what Milo's in-universe classic character were like but denied I guess.
Eric: Listen he’s a Star Trek nerd already, he never played Dungeon and Dragons, it’s too nerdy even for Milo.
Brandon (as Milo): Do you think Dr. Morrow can see you? Or is it just me?
Eric (as spirit): Oh man well I mean for whatever time have been trapped in the pod I don't think no — I don't think so not even a little talk to anyone like I know I seem pretty nonchalant now but how long I don't even know how long it's been I've been in there and no one's responded other than you so it might be something. I'm surprised you can talk to me! How can you do that?
Brandon (as Milo): That's why I was gonna ask do you know anything about the like you know after part you know?
Eric (as spirit): The epilogue? Like the after game like when you beat the campaign in Pokemon and then you play more things afterwards?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah the credit sequence for Humanity something about that?
Eric (as spirit): Yeah no you know I've read some stuff but there are ideas that maybe when your spirit leaves your body it's more just like the energy and you still exist within the universe but those are just theories I mean how can you test death? You can't! You can't do an experiment.
Brandon (as Milo): True,yeah…
Eric (as spirit): It's cool you can talk to me that's pretty sick.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I'm glad you have a friend in the post afterlife. The after afterlife.
Eric (as spirit): Yeah I like that in the after credits I like that new game plus.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah new game plus.
Eric (as spirit): Nice alright duces.
Brandon (as Milo): Well okay yeah if you ever need anything let me know.
Eric (as spirit): I don't know it works after this…
Eric: You feel like he's kind of deteriorating a little bit like he glow on his back is happening a little bit more. He reaches out his hand to shake your hand.
Eric (as spirit): Hey thanks dude letting me out.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah of course uh yeah.
Brandon: I shake his hand.
Eric: You shake his hand and you feel like maybe for a moment like your eyes glowed green you changed like for a moment it's like you flickered on you flickered back off. And we've talked about this a little bit and how uncontrollable it is but I think that as you interact with more spirits I think maybe you have a better handle on what's happening and the ghostliness so by DM what I'm giving to you is that you have more of a control of your spirit. I looked at it and you have +5 to animal handling is that right?
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: So now you can use that animal handling on Tuna so Tuna is a cat and kind of does what cats do. So if you roll an animal handling check on Tuna they are more likely to be more effective when you ask them to do things.
Brandon: Great! And yeah I think there's also the spirits control goes part and parcel with just Milo's confidence in himself, and I think he's you know now that he can talk to a spirit he feels a little bit better about what's happening and a little bit more understanding.
Eric: Absolutely I have this boy you have this like moment of calm you're like hey I did the thing it's not just me talking to a dumb cat like I talked to an actual person!
Brandon: And then I look up and realize there's a human skeleton in front of me!
Eric: At this point security it's like running past. You get pushed to the side and you can see Mr. Brewpot like
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Oh no! I can't believe this happened son are you alright?!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I'm totally fine!
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Oh we never should have let you expose yourself! You have such a sensitive constitution!
Brandon (as Milo): That's a weird thing to say alright.
Eric: Alright, and we’ll cut away from there.

Eric: Hey what do you want to what do you want to do what kind of wild and crazy stuff does Aggie get up to on Saturday?
Amanda: I'm not gonna let you demean Aggie by making fun of all of the housekeeping, gardening, canning, and pickling that Aggie likes to do on the weekends. But today Aggie wakes up with a real sense of purpose and gets dressed checks online the hours for Town Hall and heads on over to the town archives which is down in the city center kind of near the Capitol building.
Eric: Cool, cool, cool! Alright yeah you've definitely been down in that Town Hall before so this shouldn't be a problem. What is your relationship I guess to the larger government like do they know who you are can you just walk into the archive?
Amanda: Yeah so it's kind of like Aggie is almost like a representative from a u.s. territory which are ruled by and yet not allowed to vote on issues decided by the Congress.
Eric: It's a real Guam situation.
Amanda: It is! A real Guam situation and less unjust than those but Aggie is kind of like an unelected representative for Lake Town for historic Lake Town. So basically she sits in on council meetings she is sort of present like allowed to be around and sometimes they kind of like ask her opinion it's almost like they're allowing in name, but not really in power for the old-school citizens of Lake Town to have a say in Lake Town city's development.
Eric: I think that's interesting we talked about this in the world-building episodes and I think that like each neighborhood might like have a City Council representative similar to what we have in New York City or borough presidents or whatever. Maybe it's like a park technically like it shouldn't have a voting representative right but it's you who also has this custodian position because it's designated by the state/federal government.
Amanda: Yeah and like Aggie is sort of the like there's a board of trustees of them like historic like town kind of Visitor Center and museum. But Aggie is like the one person who is not like a retiree, or has other nonprofit jobs um so she kind of just shows up to stuff and so it's almost like you have so many reasons that you would need to give her a call, that she's kind of just like around for a lot of stuff but that being said, Lake Town city has so many things going on that it doesn't always affect Aggie. She's not super up-to-date on like what's happening all the other neighborhoods they kind of like talk to her about issues that affect historic Lake Town so she's sort of in but not really of the broader city government.
Eric: That's interesting it's like if the representative for Washington D.C. to Congress was also the mayor of Washington D.C. That's definitely the closest comp I can think of but it's not like a city scale.
Amanda: Yeah and so far Aggie hasn't had to take a lot of stands because she's only 30 and a lot of this development happened before she took this position about six years ago. So she is very friendly with and kind of like walk around in the town hall like it's not unusual to see her there. I think today you know she's going to do some research about Ma’s, about ice cream trucks, and about this mysterious knight on a reflective motorcycle. But she doesn't wanna make it super obvious that she is like digging around so she kind of like strolls in coffee in hands,—
[Ambient typing and office sounds start]
Amanda: She says hi to the guards, says hi to the secretaries. The town hall’s opened because the DMV is open for a little while so it's kind of like a skeleton crew but she tries to kind of amble casually back to the archives.
Eric: Yeah I think you can get into the archives, this feels like when you go to like the microfiche section of a library. It's like you should have someone you know out pulling —
Amanda: Like ahh! Someone’s here!
Eric: Yeah like you should have someone pulling for you but like honestly if you're there you probably are someone who already knows what they're doing. But you definitely need to make an investigation role for how good your research skills are at the moment.
Julia: I can't wait for like 10 episodes from now where Aggie has a conspiracy board with red strings and stuff like that. So stoked for it.
Amanda: I also I mentioned that she's in her off day chambray shirt —
Julia: Of course!
Amanda: So not the work denim heaviness but just a day off shirt.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Gooosse Dwn Laketon.
Amanda: Awww. Sorry to say, I got a natural 1 on that one.
Eric: Oh Jesus Christ.
Julia: There's been two whole rolls that one was a natural 20 and a natural 1.
Amanda: Well here we are.
Eric: Oh man…
Brandon: Did Aggie forget her vowels?
Amanda: Oh beans.
Eric: Okay so what was your what's your top priority?
Amanda: Top priority is — I want to lie to you right now, but I'm not, the financial state of Ma’s. Like have there been bankruptcies have there been loans, is there like criminal activity that is somehow tied to Ma’s or Ma’s nephews that's mainly what I'm trying to get at. Like why would someone from Ma's be starting a criminal syndicate.
Eric: Alright cool so I think that this is like this is in the historic Lake Town section. So you're trying to track the business of Ma’s so you pull down that section, and there's some newspaper clippings, and there’s some financial ledgers. So Ma her name is Phyllis Crock, C R O C K, you know that the Crocks have been making ice cream for a very long time Ma's been running Ma's Ice Cream Shop since like the seventies and she's still doing it. Yeah you look at the financial records and Ma’s has always been doing like pretty okay starting from before the incident and then continuing especially because Ma’s has been integrated into kind of like the historic Williamsburgization of historic Lake Town so it's always like —
Amanda: Franchising in the stadium and stuff like that.
Eric: Yeah a little bit I think that there's been some reach out for there and maybe there's one outpost and maybe there it was like a hipsterized version in Thornhill a little while ago, but really those didn't do that well and maybe they're not those aren't there anymore. Like they tried to expand so now it's just Ma’s but the original Ma’s is doing really well.
Julia: OG Ma’s.
Eric: When you're digging in a little bit deeper you get a text message and I think this gets projected it’s kind of like a howler and Harry Potter. It's just like ALERT ALERT ALERT! And it’s a text from your younger sister Kelly.
Brandon: Is it like projected out of the phone
Eric: Yeah it's projected out of the phone it's because you have it on silent because you're in a library it's just like ALERT ALERT ALERT!
Amanda: Oh I open up the text from Kelly.
Eric: Kelly is the one who's a model, and internet fave she's on like makeup in CVS or like you know when you go into CVS and see all the hair dye like she's on 50% of them and she's been on Drag Race a bunch. And she’s like
Eric (as Kelly): Aggie!! I have a leak in my toilet!
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Kelly, which of your houses is this?
Eric (as Kelly): Umm oh God, two of them.
Amanda (as Aggie): Which two?
Eric (as Kelly): Um well you know not in the houses, in two of the apartments.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay cause if it was if it was your apartment in Thornhill, I mean I could come over but if it's the other ones like you got to call your super Kelly. I'm not your super.
Eric (as Kelly): No one’s in Hawaii, and one’s in New York City. Well not mine I'm staying with a friend, it's not really a friend it's more of like a guy who’s paying for all my things. But in two of them the one I own, the one in Hawaii well no I don't know that's my friend’s too. They both have leaks in the toilet. Can you fix them? What do I do?
Amanda (as Aggie): Why does she think through her own sentence in the text, and not before sending the text…
[Everyone laughs]
Eric (as Kelly): AGGIE!!!
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay you're gonna want to tighten the release, you’re gonna close the water pipe that goes — you know like the little pipe on the bottom of the toilet there's like two little knobs —
Eric (as Kelly): Hold on, let me FaceTime you.
Eric: And now you see she's laying down on her couch with her phone above above her so you could just see her laying on the couch.
Julia: For the best angles.
Eric (as Kelly): Aggie what do I do!
Amanda: Use the YouTube, Kelly. Look on YouTube about how to stop a toilet leak just turn off the water that goes into the toilet, so two little pipes on the bottom coming out of the wall there's like a mean pipe that goes into the bottom of the toilet there's two on either side of it —
Eric (as Kelly): Wait, hold on wait, wait, wait.
Eric: And then she goes on Skype —
Amanda: Pretend it's a bath and the baths about to overflow and turn it off.
Eric (as Kelly): No I know that’s why I called you it’s so important.
Eric: And she goes on Skype on her computer and she has her friend
Eric (as Kelly): Hey this is Ashley, she’s in Hawaii, can you tell her what to do?
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh my god…
Eric: And you reverse the camera on the phone and you’re talking to Ashley who’s on the Skype computer
Amanda (as Aggie): Ashley you look like a reasonable person don’t you—
Eric (as Ashley): WHAT?
Amanda (as Aggie): Don’t you have a super Ashley?
Eric (as Ashley): Super what?
Amanda (as Aggie): Who takes care of your apartment who takes out your garbage?
Eric (as Ashley): I mean like my husband.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay so not at the risk of sounding sexist can your husband fix the toilet please?
Eric (as Ashley): Okay let me ask MAAARK! MARK!
Eric: So this goes on for twenty minutes and uh —
Brandon: And real player Brandon leaves.
[Amanda laughing]
Julia: I am so sorry.
Eric: So this goes on for a while and you're just caught in a various tornado of conversations.
Amanda: Yeah when I managed to extricate myself I'm gonna send her just a link to WikiHow My Toilet Is Overflowing Help.
Eric: At this point a guard walks in and be like
Eric (as guard): Um ma'am, we're gonna have a fire drill in about two minutes so everyone just needs to clear out so just uh make sure that you're out of here.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh thank you thanks Henry. I'll see you next week for the meeting right? Eric (as Henry): Yeah I don't know uh, Aggie I'm at work so uh,ma'am just please.
Amanda (as Aggie): Thank you, officer.
Amanda: Then I give him a little jaunty head nod as I walk out.
Julia: Wink!
Eric: So yeah the fire alarm goes off after a minute and you gotta clear out.
Amanda: Alright so embarrassed by the critical one that Aggie feels, even though she doesn't know what happened to her.I'm going to instead go like across the the quadrangle like across the square to the Lake Town City Police Headquarters, where one of my buddies from growing up works, and see if I can sort of ask him to give me some access to information about Ma's Nephew's, if they have any criminal history.
Eric: Nice as you're walking up you get another text message and this is the group text of all three of you and Emily which she's now changed to Only You Can Stop Crime.
Amanda: Is it a detective emoji at the end?
Eric: Yeah, there's a dog emoji then a detective emoji.
Eric (as Emily): Hey! Got us some intel, we heard that the Nephews are gonna try to break their friends out of jail, so IT’S A STAKEOUT!
Eric: In all caps.
Brandon (as Milo): Who’s this? jk jk jk.
Eric (as Emily): LOL good joke. You three can stake out the jail or you can try and track them and their hideout in historic Lake Town. I’ll take the other one, what do you want?
Amanda: Aggie said
Amanda (as Aggie): It’s Emily by the way.
Amanda: In the text chain once Milo asked.
[Eric laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): LOL jk but who is this really?
Eric (as Emily): EMILY!!
Brandon (as Milo): Jk jk
Eric (as Emily): Oh my god.
Eric: Okay, so my players! Emily got some Intel that the nephews are gonna try to break the four guys you put away out of jail however that might happen, and however might be. You three have a choice you can either do a stakeout of the jail to see what their deal is, or you can try to find their hideout when theoretically the majority or all of them are gone and this is more of a discovery sort of mission.
Brandon: I'm gonna text back
Brandon (as Milo): You're gonna have to give us a little more info on who you got this information from before we commit to anything.
Brandon: I’m gonna do a persuasion roll.
Eric: Okay, persuasion.
Brandon: Don’t know why I chose that, it’s probably gonna be very bad! Yes it iiiis!
Julia: Yeah, your charisma’s terrible.
Amanda: Val forgot their phone.
Julia: Do have the best charisma of this team? What is happening?
Amanda: Yeah, I’m -1.
Julia: I’m +1
Brandon: Yeah speaking of 2 -1 is a 1.
Amanda: Oh bud…
Julia: Jesus...
Eric: With a 1 Emily says—
Brandon: My text fails to go through.
Eric: Yes! No actually that's 100% what happens you're just like
Eric (as Milo): Damn, why do I have T-Mobile, shit shit.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah it was cheaper but it's not worth it!
Eric: You have Cricket.
Julia: Jesus.
Amanda: Aggie asks
Amanda (as Aggie): When is this supposed to go down?
Eric: Emily says
Eric (as Emily): It’s supposed to go down tonight, probably sometime late, that’s the best I know. That’s why it’s a stakeout.
Juia: Val checks their phone but is also moving people right now, so just the the read receipt. Amanda: Aggie’s gonna reply
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm actually at the police station right now let me see what I can find out about the hideout.
Julia: I think Val in between moving heavy boxes texts back at Aggie
Julia (as Val): Ask about the ice-cream truck.
Amanda (as Aggie): On it!
Julia (as Val): Tight.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay I'll text you back shortly.
Eric: Amanda you love elementary is this like you have a friend on the force who’s like a good detective?
Amanda: No my friend is just a rank-and-file cop so this is Brian Roper, he’s the Ropers son.
Eric: Ahh, of course!
Amanda: And he does not see his parents as often as he should but we were pretty much neighbors growing up, and he's my age so we see each other you know around historic Lake Town. But I'm gonna go now I think visiting him for the first time at work besides like whatever like getting a permit or something.
Eric: Yeah you walk in and Brian is looking very intently at some forms.
Amanda (as Aggie): Brian what's going on?
Eric (as Brian): Does it still count as a block party if it doesn't cover the whole block?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah Brian it's probably the heavens on the block.
Eric (as Brian): Oh I missed that in the police academy hmm so I'll sign for it seems neat maybe I'll go check it out. Aggie what's up?
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen Brian number one, just gonna say this one time sorry if it comes off wrong.
Eric (as Brian): Okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Your parents are lonely.
Brandon: Wow.
Amanda (as Aggie): Go see them a little bit.
Eric (as Brian): Alright.
Amanda (as Aggie): I just wanna know in your situation just letting you know they are breaking their toilet every other day and I'm going to fix it.
Eric (as Brian): It's not as much of a call for help as you think it is. I think they just have a bad toilet, it's a bad toilet.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, you believe what you want to believe okay—
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen I need a paper from you.
Eric (as Brian): Alright Veronica Mars what do you got?
Amanda (as Aggie): I don't know that reference.
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Have you heard of the Nephews?
Eric (as Brian): Oh [exhales loudly] yeah I mean I've heard of them. Used to be a part of the paddle boats they're all Ma's kids yeah, what's up?
Amanda (as Aggie): I'm gonna need you to either tell me some information about what they have done in the past, or walk away from your laptop for a minute. Because some of them tried to come at me last night. You know me I don't want to make this into a whole thing, I'd rather just go and and have a discussion. So I'm gonna need some help right now.
Eric (as Brian): They went at you last night you didn't file a report? What do you mean you got beat up on the street?
Amanda (as Aggie): No it’s — listen it didn't end up being anything—
Amanda: And happy roll persuasion here DM.
Eric: I think this is more deception.
Amanda: Okay!
Eric: Yeah roll a deception roll cause this is just like kind of a lie.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 12.
Eric: Okay with a 12
Eric (as Brian): Okay, Aggie, you need to report these so that people can take care of you. If you got mugged on the street that would be bad. I'm not gonna leave my laptop, but if you asked me a question I'll look it up. [mumbling] I know I'm not as smart as you but like I can figure things out I figure that thing out about the block party so.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda (as Aggie): Brian you're very smart.
Eric (as Brian): Thank you.
Amanda: Do you know where the Nephews are headquartered? Do they have a lair? Also have they been tied to any sightings of ice cream trucks or motorcycles with like a reflective coating?
Eric: Two of those questions are bananas so I'm gonna answer the one that makes more sense. The lair no they're not Lex Luthor, I guess but I can look that up. I know that they hang out on the dock —
Amanda (as Aggie): No in the file I saw —
Eric (as Brian): No I know I'm looking it up! I know personally that they hang out on the dock in the lake and there's that boathouse over there. I guess they played bad music and yell at each other and throw bottles and axes you know the usual.
Amanda (as Aggie): Gotta clean up the glass ugh.
Eric (as Brian): It's bad, I mean that's more of a you thing, uh I'm yeah alright look it up
Brandon: Cleaning up the block parties.
Julia: I like that he's like oh you know the youths they throw axes.
Amanda: They pay to do that now!
Julia: Mhm!
Eric (as Brian): Yeah, I mean a bunch of them yeah we picked them up for a bunch of stuff. Petty larceny, vandalism, this one oh this one's wild this one grand theft auto they. It is of an ice cream truck, that's kind of interesting.
Amanda (as Aggie): Where’d they steal it from?
Eric (as Brian): Seems like they'd stolen from a truck depot it sells like strange cars... Strange cars and vehicles.
Brandon: Weird Al's weird car emporium!
Eric (as Brian): Yeah actually if Weird Al's Weird Car Emporium!
Brandon: No relation.
Eric: I was just about to say that.
Eric (as Brian): Yeah it's like when you pick up you know things that have things on top like the Wienermobile. You know the Wienermobile?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm familiar!
Eric (as Brian): Uhh, let's see yeah the so those kids broke bad but I don't hold that against Ma.
Amanda (as Aggie): No, no, of course not, of course not, and just the last question any I don't know I've heard some kids talking about in the museum. Is there like someone with like a glass motorcycle or like metal? Or some kind of reflective outside have you heard about that? Is it just an urban legend?
Eric (as Brian): Aggie I'm not saying this to be mean, but is there a gas leak in your house? Because I will check it out.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know Brian, that's a great point you're a real friend. I'm gonna go check my carbon monoxide detector.
Eric (as Brian): Smart probably for the best.
Amanda (as Aggie): Cool alright I'll see you around, parents house!
Eric (as Brian): Alright. See you ma'am! Thank you for doing your duty to the city and reporting crimes!
Amanda: Aggie walks hurriedly out ducking under her mountain lobsters cap. In the parking lot she's gonna text the rest of the group “looks like the boathouse by historic lake town is where these nephew's hang out”
Brandon (as Milo): Who's this? LOL is that joke still funny?
Eric and Julia: NO.
Amanda: Aggie dislikes the text.
Brandon: Milo just dislikes his own text
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: Wonderful! What do the three of you decide?
Julia: I say boat house.
Amanda: Boat house.
Brandon: Boat house!
Amanda: Boat house, house for boats!
Eric: Alright so uh why didn't you guys text Emily back and let her know.
Amanda: I think we should hit it. I'm not here to stop a jailbreak.
Brandon: Yeah there's police in the jail they got it let's let's go to the boathouse.
Julia: Let's go beat up some teens.
Brandon: Let's beat up some people over 18.
Amanda: Aggie response to Val's text with a question mark, and then changes it to exclamation points.
Julia: Excellent, thanks for the back up!
Eric: Emily responds
Eric (as Emily): LOL great, I’ll stake out the jail, I’ve got some people that can run with me no problem! Just let me know what’s up! And yeah, just text me.
Julia: Now I'm worried she made a squad with Sour Anthony and the horse guy.
Amanda: I write back “Sour Anthony?”
Brandon: Yeah and I add a question mark on her text.
Eric (as Emily): Listen, I have a bigger budget than I thought! So I’m bringing more people on! Julia: Gif of just like frustrated sigh rolling of the eyes.
Brandon (as Milo): That was not the deal.
Eric (as Emily): The deal is now I have 10,000 more dollars, so see you later!
Julia (as Val): Where did she get 10,000 more dollars.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh no idea…
Julia: Can we create a side chat only without Emily in it please?
Eric: Oh yeah you guys could do whatever you want.
Brandon: What are you gonna name it?
Julia: Valkyrie it's it's just like not friends sans Emily.
Eric: Allright cool so uh how do you want to do this? Your mission as defined by Emily, is trying to find, and also scoping out the quote unquote lair of the Nephews.
Brandon: Milo texts the side chat and says
Brandon (as Milo): You guys want to get tacos and then head to the boathouse?
Julia (as Val): Hell yeah tacos yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah why doesn't someone bring them to my place? I live right by the boathouse, we can park our cars and and walk over from there.
Brandon (as Milo): Sounds good you got any recs for good tacos next to you I was gonna go down to Tortilla Jane's.
Amanda (as Aggie): No I haven't heard of it but I'm down to try anything.
Julia (as Val): I got to drop off some food for my ma first but then I'll be there.
Brandon (as Milo): Great text me your orders.
Amanda (as Aggie): Meet at seven?
Julia (as Val): Tight.
Eric: Wonderful alright so Milo's bring the tacos and there you all meet it Aggies place.
Brandon: I brought everyone guac, on me, very generous.
Amanda: Meaning you walk in and ask us for money?
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: [Mockingly] No okay I got guac for everybody but I have the receipts right here so if you can just venmo me.
Julia: Val proposes
Julai (as Val): I think we should save all the receipts and then just send them to Emily when we’re done with this.
Brandon (as Milo): That’s a great idea!
Amanda (as Aggie): I like the way you think.
Eric: Emily’s walking and she’s like shit!
Amanda (as Aggie): So listen the boathouse is like a five minute walk away it's on the actual lake but there's a little embankment before the road so we can wait across the road there's like trees and some rocks like an old staircase that leads to nowhere so don't worry about it it's just from fire it's not like a ghost thing.[laughs] I don't know.
Brandon (as Milo): Ghost thing?!
Julia: Val just looks at Milo.
Brandon (as Milo): [shouting] WHAT!
Julia (as Val): I dunno, man.
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t look at you when I talk about pizza.
Julia (as Val): I mean you could,
Eric: [Talking like Val] That is definitely my personal thing it's my brand.
Julia (as Val): It is one of my jobs.
Amanda (as Aggie): So if they're actually breaking people out of jail tonight, I know that shift change is at 8:00. So maybe they'll try to, I don't know I’ve seen that in movies like would they try to hit it at that time.
Amanda: And I I distinctly don't look at Val as I asked that question.
Brandon (as Milo): I would assume, yeah! I mean that’s what I would do. If I were a criminal.
Julia: Val just eats their taco.
Amanda (as Aggie): So if we watch the place at that time, Emily is whatever, but I think that was a good idea so we can just see if it's emptied and then you know do a little circuit, and try to see. I have some flashlights over here if you all have like a black coat or something I can loan you one of mine.
Brandon (as Milo): I got you one better. You guys want to be shadows again? I can try that!
Julia (as Val): That was pretty dope when it happened.
Amanda (as Aggie): That was fun yeah, I do.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay!
Julia (as Val): It's not everyday we get to be a shadow it's all I'm saying.
Brandon (as Milo): It's my third time it's pretty neat.
Eric: You can decide when you want to cast that but that's a good idea.
Brandon: Yeah I'm gonna wait until we see the leave the place and then cast it.
Eric: Sick that sounds great I love that. Alright yet do you want to do anything before you leave or you just wanna head over there?
Brandon: I want to finish the the last bit of the guac.
Eric: Very important.
Julia: Val just puts a taco in their pocket to go.
Brandon (as Milo): That’s — Val that's not… Okay there's salsa on that.
Julia (as Val): Yes there is!
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen if for whatever reason stuff goes bad just meet back at the house okay?
Brandon (as Milo): Cool.
Eric: Okay cool! Yeah you three walk over to the boathouse so the way that Lake Town the original Lake Town was set up, there were a bunch of bungalow houses were surrounding the lake which of course is just an inlet on to Lake Champlain because it's not actually a lake there's like a little river that connects the two but of course Lake Town lake whatever. Before the incident this is where people would ice skate in the winter go, swimming in the summer, go sailing, and all that fun stuff and then there's a dock where you could like rent kayaks and canoes and stuff. But now since it's more kind of just a living museum the dock isn't really used for anything unless there's personal use from the people who live there, and the boathouse has now been taken over by just some rowdy teens and young people, and it sounds like the nephews are now using it as their hideout.
Amanda: There have been plans to revitalize it to make it into a restaurant, to make it into a like marine museum extension, but yeah nothing has worked.
Eric: Yeah so I will give all of you an action what do you want to look at, what do you want to do while you're outside? Are you doing a stakeout, are you trying to scope? Are you trying to go in what is your plan? Emily only asked for you to find it which you did and then to scope it out but of course you three can do whatever you want.
Julia: I think looking for activity makes the most sense to kind of start with so that we can see if there's like movement inside or lights or something like that and determine whether or not we can safely enter.
Amanda: Yeah I think maybe we can approach to see if it's empty or not, and if it is, get shadowed up, and then head over. I'm also bringing my ring of super keys, and the odds that I have a key this both house are pretty high.
Eric: Wonderful.
Brandon: Y’all, I’ve got an idea.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna! Tuna?
Amanda (as Aggie): We just ate…
[Eric laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna?
Eric: Tuna walks out of a bush he’s like —
Brandon (as Milo): You're a ghost why are you in a bush?!
Eric (as Tuna): That was more for a dramatic effect hello!
Brandon (as Milo): God you’re so dramatic…
Julia: Val reaches down and tries to go for scritches again.
Eric: So this is a good point you don't see Tuna.
Julia: Oh okay.
Eric: Right now it looks like Milo is just calling out for Tuna, but now you know that Tuna is in fact Milo's ghost cat.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: But you don't see Tuna.
Julia: Okay! Val’s just like
Julia (as Val): Your weird cat’s not here right now.
Brandon (as Milo): No, they’re here.
Julia (as Val): Well where is the weird cat then?
Brandon (as Milo): They came out of the bush.
Julia (as Val): I guess that is just a bush.
Brandon (as Milo): Get out of the bush.
Amanda (as Aggie): Why can't we see you ghost cat?
Julia (as Val): Did you know about the ghost cat?
Eric (as Tuna): I have been here I—
Julia (as Val) He has a ghost cat.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh!
Amanda: Aggie is just looking between these two very quickly.
[Eric laughs]
Julia (as Val): It is a very good cat that also talks.
Brandon (as Milo): I have a cat it was my it was my cat when I was when it was alive, it was our house cat and then it died thankfully cause it's the worst cat alive. Now it follows me around!
Eric (as Tuna): I was your dad’s cat.
Julia (as Val): So apparently the death did not help because the cat is still around.
Eric (as Tuna): I was your dad's cat, I was never your cat. Yeah, I only did what your dad said.
Brandon (as Milo): You've made that abundantly clear, Tuna.
Eric (as Tuna): Meow.
Amanda (as Aggie): My cat’s name is Sushi, that’s so cool!
Brandon (as Milo): Oh that’s really cute!
Julia (as Val): You all have cats? That’s uh
Amanda (as Aggie): You were just in my house, Sushi sat on your lap!
Julia (as Val): There was a cat there, I remember that.
Eric: Retcon Sushi just on top of Val. Just on Val’s head.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sushi ate your chips!
Julia (as Val): That is fine, and I’m okay with this.
Amanda (as Aggie): You said “No! Infernal creature!” And then you pet them.
Julia (as Val): I did give chin scritches which was easier than with your cat. Which is definitely not there!
Brandon (as Milo): Yes at least I'm not allergic to my ghost cat though so—
Julia (as Val): That is probably a plus you save a lot on Zyrtec.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna can you go check the boathouse and see if there's anyone in there?
Eric (as Tuna): I could try, maybe they have cool things in there.
Brandon: I'm gonna roll an animal handling.
Eric: Do it.
Amanda: [Chanting] Plus five, plus five, plus five, plus five!
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: 18 + 5 for 23!
[Everyone cheering]
Julia: Tuna gonna listen!!
Eric: So how do you get Tuna to listen this time?
Brandon: I ask nicely.
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: I'm not in control of this animal.
Eric: Alright so I think that a little ghost hand comes out of your chest and it drops like a little thing at ghost catnip, and Tuna’s like
Eric (as Tuna): Mmmm more of that I'll get you somewhere!
Eric: And Tuna just plays with it, and eats it. Maybe plays a little much and then now stoned, trumps into the boat house, and disappears into a wall.
Julia: Val is just like
Julia (as Val): What is happening here?
Brandon: I look at my chest and I’m like
Brandon (as Milo): Don’t do that again, I’m not going to reward this behavior, don’t do that!
Eric: The ghost does a peace sign like Ash Ketchum and then disappears back into your body.
Amanda: Strong Pokemon undercurrents.
Julia (as Val): Your bonus hand is weird.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Okay so I think that you're far enough away this happened so if you walk over there at 7:45, I think at like 7:55 you see that some people walk out and hop in a car and drive away.
Amanda (as Aggie): Time for that shadow thing Milo.
Brandon: Does Tuna come back?
Eric: Yeah so Tuna comes back in and Tuna says
Eric (as Tuna): Mmm they have so many—so many crumbs everywhere, but also I think it's because of all the food because they're bad at cleaning.
Brandon (as Milo): You're a very weird cat.
Eric (as Tuna): I love things, they also have lots of shelves for me to jump on. There's still a lot of guys in there though!
Brandon (as Milo): So that wasn't all of them that left?
Eric: No that was not all of them.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Tuna also gives you kind of a floor plan, it's a pretty big boathouse I think there are two main rooms. One they've turned into kind of like a living room area, and one of they turn into a kind of kitchen area which is where the said food there's just like shit everywhere it is incredibly messy in there. There are also stairs that lead to a lower area but Tuna did not venture down there.
Julia: Are the stairs in the kitchen area, or the kitchen in the living room area?
Eric: The living room area is where you walk in and it's off of the kitchen area, which is in the back. So the guys went out through the front door which was attached to the living room area, and then three guys walked over to a car, but Tuna says there's still a bunch of dudes inside.
Julia (as Val): Can we get like a full count of how many dudes it is? Or?
Eric (as Tuna): There’s like a handful. A paw full.
Brandon (as Milo): Tuna, that’s nothing! Learn to count, please.
Eric (as Tuna): I have this many
Eric: They hold up one paw. Julia: That’s adorable, [angrily] CAN’T SEE IT THOUGH!
Brandon (as Milo): Does the thumb count as a finger- a digit? What are we doing here?
Eric: It’s more just a flippity thing!
Julia: Does he have the little extra thumb?
Eric: Yeah they have the little extra thingy.
Julia: Awww polydactyl.
Eric (as Tuna): It’s vestigial so.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay stick around we may need you. Just shadow up and go in y'all?
Eric: Val and Aggie you can still do a thing outside.
Julia: I'd like to like stealth around and see if there's like a basement door or something like that since there's stairs leading down stairs.
Eric: That is a good idea!
Amanda: I can also let you two do that and then I can pose as myself to like come inspect or like there was a gas leak and and like distract the guys going into the front door.
Brandon: I like that.
Amanda: Because of my superpower I have advantage on deception checks.
Julia: If there's a back door or a basement door yes.
Eric: You can do it in succession I mean you three are connected and you have your phones so there is —
Amanda: If I talk to them, then I can have them walk me inside toward the kitchen and then you guys can do whatever you want!
Julia: Maybe yeah.
Brandon: Cool so why don't you just open the door, or why don't you have the door for us, Aggie, and then we'll just slip in.
Amanda: Yeah and—
Eric: I will say, tough stealth roll. The DC of the stealth roll doesn't change but you have +10 to it so if you were to walk by somebody who opened a door that would be DC 25, however you would have +10 plus stealth to it so it would be easier than just trying to slip by somebody regularly. You know I'm saying?
Brandon: I do yeah! Do you think there’s a back entrance?
Julia: I'd like to check to see if there's a back entrance.
Amanda: So if this is a traditional boathouse that means that the front door is on ground level and then the basement is a dock, so it's like a it's like a drive-in garage, so there are probably like multiple stalls and boats and generally those aren't like a thing you can lock, so you might be able just to like walk down the embankment and just like walk into the dock level. Should come up the stairs.
Julia: Well I think that's a smart move.
Eric: I love that that's great. So you want to do it simultaneously?
Brandon: Yeah I think Aggie will cause a small distraction, and then we’ll shadow up and go.
Julia: I want to I want to shadow up I just think we should investigate the basement if it's empty at that time and then once we know that like that coast is clear, having Aggie serve as the distraction at the front door so we can investigate the kitchen would make sense.
Eric: I would say that Val you make this perception check I want you to scope things out.
Julia That’s a 10 for perception.
Eric: A straight 10?
Julia: Straight 10.
Eric: Okay with a 10 what Aggie said describing a boathouse is correct. There is an upper level which is on ground level, and then below is the one that leads out to the dock. Val, as you're walking around staying in the dark you can see that there's like uh — Aggie described that it's just like there should just be some canoes there and then there is a there are stairs up and then it goes into actual level but it's like they fashioned a garage door like in front of the opening that would usually just go out into the lake so there is a garage door and that's all I can give you with a 10.
Julia: Then Aggie probably will need to serve as a distraction well I power lift this door open. I am very strong.
Amanda: And if all else fails I'll try to glean whatever I can from the inside of the house.
Eric: Okay so what is the plan? Simultaneously Aggie poses as the super to come in and says something while you two pass without trace and try to get in the bottom.
Amanda: I would say give me like a 30-second head start just so that they can like call people up if there’s anyone down there, and Aggie says
Amanda (as Aggie): So if I think that they're catching on to you at all are we hear a noise from the basement I'm gonna say like well we gotta call the gas company and then that'll be like our sign.
Brandon (as Milo): Got you.
Eric: Wonderful alright so let's start let's cast pass without a trace. Let's do the spirit surge so Milo roll your d20.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 13.
Eric: Alright so now you have one too, so you pass without trace. Now both of you are like a shadow in the darkness oh and now as Milo touches Val, Val you can see Tuna which is laying like a scarf on the back of Milo's neck.
Julia: Chin scritches.
Eric: Still passes through.
[Julia lets out an exasperated groan]
Amanda: Even as a shadow?
Eric: Shadow and ghosts are different. I don't know what pokemons been telling you alright let's start with Aggie. So Aggie do your thing!
Amanda: The mechanic here is that I have advantage on deception checks when I'm posing as a super but then after I have to roll my d6 and if I get a 1, they'll ask me to actually fix something.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: So I'm gonna walk up the embankment so that I am like coming at them from the actual sidewalk and not like from the side of their house, and then knock firmly on the door twice.
Eric: There’s like a bunch of rustling from inside and it goes [muffled noises] like you hear a chair slide back, and some boots stomping on wood and open the door there's just like a big like you know when you see a high schooler who's just like much bigger than you, and you're like how did genetics happen like this? Like you are 17 and you are 6’5. Oh no. So yeah there's a big looking like 17 year old pimply-faced but looming over you.
Eric (as high schooler): Hello?
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh hey I'm —
Brandon: [Laughing] You know you answer your door with hello?
Eric: Do 17 year-olds know how to open their clubhouse?
Julia: Surely they don’t.
Eric (as high schooler): Uh hello?
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh hey sorry to disturb you we got a report of a smell of gas and I'm the super for Lake Town, and I don't want to call the fire department over for nothing, so I wanted to come check it out myself. Do you guys notice anything do you've a stove in there?
Eric: He like looks back over his shoulder like he's looking at his people at someone for confirmation he's like
Eric (as high schooler): No just like a hot plate but—
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen—
Eric (as high schooler): We don't have it, we don't have anything like a stove or anything maybe it's the heating system, listen I don't want to cause you any trouble but this is a it's a pretty serious call so I just got to check it out for due diligence.
Eric: Okay let's do your super move.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: First roll is a 14
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: Other one was a 2. So it's a 13 deception total.
Eric: Okay make your d6 roll.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: A 3! Safe!
[Eric laughs]
Eric: Okay, okay with a 13, the seventeen-year-old says
Eric (as high schooler): Okay come in.
Eric: So he moves out of the way he was like
Eric (as high schooler): Hey she just needs to check stuff, she's not gonna call anybody. She's just gonna gonna check it out so it's alright.
Amanda (as Aggie): Now listen, I was 17 once too, whatever you guys are up to it doesn't matter to me. Just show me where are the heating pipes in this room?
Amanda: Aggie’s gonna try to just kind of like walk the perimeter of both rooms as a guise for looking for anything suspicious, any clues that could possibly happen. Do you want me to be like investigation or perception?
Eric: Yeah so first of all you walk in and you see that there are three guys sitting on a table they're playing Texas Hold'em, just like chips everywhere it is disgusting here.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: There is just like moldy food there are pizza boxes everywhere, there's like clothes like tons of clothes on the floor somehow.
Brandon: Eric, this is supposed to be fantasy I don't want to live in this space.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: And you can see that even in the kitchen there's just like there's no water but somehow there's just like food trash everywhere there's a hot plate there's like a mini fridge, and just lots of stuff in there.
Julia: I hate this.
Eric: So make an investigation check.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 15.
Eric: Alright, with a 15 you look around and there are a lot of surge protectors, there are only like a few sockets, but there are lots of surge protectors everywhere. It's like each one has like a real big one with like ten plugs in them, and you can see there's all there is also wires extension cords coming up from the basement.
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen I don't want to harsh your buzz guys but daisy-chaining powerstrips especially in an old building like this you just it's definitely a fire hazard, so not gonna like give you a citation or anything but if you have a lot of power coming from these you're really out of risk of blowing your circuits, maybe starting a fire.
Eric: All three of the guys stand up and you can see like one there's a shorter guy with like a really patchy beard who’s like in his early 20s it stands up
Eric (as twenty-something): [Nasally voice] Hey uh what we do here is our business, uh thanks for telling us but, I think we're fine we don't need a danger sense from McGruff the Crime Dog. So thank you, we're fine thanks. I don't smell any gas please, get out.
Amanda (as Aggie): Let me just finish my inspection real quick just a visual inspection listen I'm not gonna hassle you guys anymore, we're not gonna get into whether or not you're permitted to be here but let's let's just finish the inspection I'll get out of your hair you—
Eric (as twenty-something): Excuse me we are absolutely permitted to be here we've been here the entire time.
Eric: And I think at this point all four of them take like once menacing step towards you let's check in with our spooky boys you want to check out the garage?
Julia: Yeah!
Eric: Alright you walk over to the garage door, there's like a big old padlock lock in the garage door.
Julia: I assume because we're at a beach there's like a rock nearby probably?
Eric: Yeah definitely a rock nearby.
Julia: I think I want to take a rock and try to pound the lock off.
Eric: So metal is pretty high.
Julia: Yes do I get any bonus because I'm using a rock, and not just in my hands?
[Eric laughs]
Eric: What's your attack bonus?
Julia: My strength is 5, like +5 and then my proficiency is 2 so it's 3 and then my proficiency is 2 Eric: Okay I'll let you keep the plus 5, but you do need to roll pretty high.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: It’s a 15.
Eric: Alright I want you to make a sleight-of-hand check to see if you made noise while trying to destroy this lock.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Okay that’s a non nat 20.
Eric: Okay so you pick—
Amanda: Quiet but bad!
Eric: You pick up the rock and you're “I’ll fuck with this lock!” yeah you try to throw it at the rock but luckily it just goes right in the sand and goes womp. So you were not able to do it but you did not make any noise.
Julia (as Val): Alright well you got any ghost shit we can do here? Can the cat go back in or something?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah the cat can bo back in, uh yeah uh Tuna can you one more favor for me? Can you head in there and just see what's going on?
Eric: Sure, make an animal handling check.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 14 +5 for 19.
Eric: Okay with a 19 Tuna was like
Eric (as Tuna): You're relying on me so much, I'm sorry that you're so bad at things that you need your cat to do stuff for you. But fine!
Brandon (as Milo): Uh, thanks, I guess?
Julia (as Val): Look and see if they have like this guy's a nerd right, you've probably seen him watch like nerdy sci-fi movies before see if they have like —
Eric (as Tuna): Mmmm such a nerd.
Julia (as Val): Sci-fi guns in there.
Eric (as Tuna): Okay!
Brandon (as Milo): Is that really necessary Val?
Julia (as Val): Yes—
Eric (as Tuna): what a big—
Julia (as Val): Well if I just say guns you might look for nerf guns.
Brandon (as Milo): No I mean the nerd thing about me.
Julia (as Val): Well I was giving them context.
Brandon (as Milo): They’re a cat!
Julia (as Val): The cat doesn't need context? The cat can talk!
Brandon (as Milo): [Under his breath] Jesus christ.
Eric: Fair.
Brandon: Just for you. Eric, Tuna has advantage on wisdom checks that rely on smell.
Julia: [Laughing] Such a wise cat.
Amanda: Tunaaaa!
Eric: Tuna walks in there takes a few minutes, and then Tuna stocks back out like
Eric (as Tuna): I didn't see anything there's some power tools and boxes and and bags and stuff just trash everywhere but well I do I remember, hmmm I remember a smell, he smelled like [Pause]
Eric (as Tuna): Milo it smells like your job.
Brandon (as Milo): That's a weird way to describe that thing okay.
Eric (as Tuna): Yeah it smelled like you know that weird thing that new— the weird thing at your job?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah the pod?
Eric (as Tuna): Yeah it smelled like that.
Julia (as Val): What—what is a pod?
Brandon (as Milo): It’s a—
Julia (as Val): You work for like a self storage place?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I work for the company Pods.
Julia (as Val): Okay, that’s what I thought.
Amanda: And then upstairs Aggie says
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen, call the gas company if you smell anything that's as much as I can give you I will get out of here, respect your elders.
Eric: Both of you make a perception check.
Julia: How’d you do bud?
Brandon: I got a 21.
Julia: Oh I got an 8 so that's good.
Eric: Yeah you have like a phone call going, you hear from your phone because Aggie called you because Val loses their phone.
Brandon (as Milo): Val we gotta go.
Eric: I think at this point Milo you hear from the phone a door slam and a voice say
Eric (as voice): Hey I know who you are you're not going anywhere.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello! And welcome to the Afterparty for episodes three and four! Laketown citaaaaay!
[Collective woo]
Julia: Laketown City!!
Eric: It’s gonna be May!!
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: The joke that will be at the end of the episode.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: Yes, we’re treating you to listen for the end of the episode cause we’re gonna include some lil’ bloops there.
Julia: Some bloops!
Amanda: Well I have so much to ask and talk about, these were some action packed episodes. Is Emily evil? There’s just a lot to discuss.
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: So what we’re gonna do is talk first about player questions that we have for each other, for Eric, lil group discussion; and then move onto your questions for each of the episodes and the world and our characters in general. I think spoily corner may come back, what did I call it the first time?
Julia: Yeah that sounds right.
Eric: It was just like the eyes emoji corner or something?
Amanda: Yes, exactly!
Julia: It’s the mmm, I dunno corner.
Eric: Who can really say?
Brandon: Who can really say corner.
Eric: And truly my favorite thing listening back to it was that I was doing it to you three, and also everybody so there’s just layers of eye emoji.
Julia: Layers and layers of eye emojis.
Amanda: Well let’s maybe start with the most eye emoji part of these last two episodes to me Eric why the fuck did Val get hit by an ice cream truck?
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Hey, yeah WHY?! Why would you do me dirty like that?
Amanda: Oh sorry, sorry, Brandon is this the fuck cut of the Afterparty?
Julia: It’s my cut so the fuck stays.
Amanda: OH! It’s Julia’s cut, alright.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: Listen now that Zach Snyder is releasing the Snyder cut, we have to do the fuck cut.
Julia: Batman says fuck.
Brandon: I wanna say there was someone on Twitter that said “y’all cuss a lot”
Julia: I’m fine with that, I’m fine with that!
Amanda: Welcome to dnd as an adult.
Brandon: And they were a child.
Eric: And then all of the bloodthirsty people in the discord were like “fuck cut!”
Eric and Julia: [Chanting] Fuck cut! Fuck cut! Fuck cut!
Brandon: Exactly.
Amanda: Listen, kids these days they’re on the internet. They have YouTube, they have TikTok some of them live in cities and—
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: They hear these words and it’s up to them and their parents to talk about when it’s appropriate to use them.
Brandon: It’s true, I just wanted to say that we were both right.
Julia: Okay, okay.
Amanda: [laughing] I’ll take it, I’ll take it! Eric, talk about this ice cream truck. Why did it happen and did you intend to end the episode that way, or was this something that came up?
Brandon: Yeah were you just like feeling vindictive at the end like “y’know what would be good for this? Let’s hit Val with an ice cream truck.”
Julia: Mhm, checks out.
Eric: So that point, I will say that this is a different type of game than we played in the first campaign. Like you do need to do more damage when you are having a powered game to illustrate the fact that one, they are human, but two, they are superhuman. So it’s literally two sides of that coin, it’s like Val tried to tackle an ice cream truck, which is something that you would not do as a person, but the fact that Val has a human corporeal form takes that much damage when they do get hit by an ice cream truck I thought was important to do. It’s more like I really like drawing these threads out even though it was more of a quote unquote “fight episode” I really love the obstacle course and I know we’re gonna talk about it but doing it was just really fun because it’s like a character tinged sort of fight or contest that you’re doing it for a reason. But yeah I wanted to pull on the ice cream truck stuff a little bit another like adding a little clue like what is this ice cream stuff? Why does it keep coming up? I don’t know [laughs] we recorded so far in the future. I don’t wanna say anything. But yeah it’s just another I’m throwing another clue on the fire I guess.
Brandon: What did y’all — did you guys have ice cream trucks growing up?
Julia: Yeah! Did you not have ice cream trucks?
Brandon: No I did I just didn’t know, Texas is weird. What did y’all get at the ice cream truck? This is very important to me.
Julia: I would always, so the go-to ice cream truck here on Long Island was Mr. Softy because Mr. Softy did soft serve, and also you could dip the soft serve and also get sprinkles on it, it was very important. Very important.
Amanda: Chocolate dipped, chocolate sprinkle.
Julia: Chocolate dip, chocolate sprinkle. Yeah I would do chocolate dipped rainbow sprinkle, and vanilla ice cream. That was my go-to.
Eric: You gotta get that chipwich bruh.
Amanda: I was just about to say chipwich was my go-to as well.
Julia: I was also a weird child and I liked a snow cone.
Brandon: Yeah snow cone is good. You guys all chose things that didn’t exist in the south so.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: What’d you get then?
Eric: It was just a frozen tumbleweed put onto a cone.
Amanda: That rainbow rocket?
Brandon: I didn’t hear about chipwiches until after college, and uh—
Amanda: Oh Brandon.
Brandon: Mr. Softy I learned in college, obviously, or soft serve from a truck. But—
Julia: Poor, poor child, so deprived.
Brandon: I know, but I would get a cartoon ice cream pop thing, like Sonic faces, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle faces.
Julia: And they were always slightly melty and the eyes were off, I love those.
Brandon: Exactly!
Eric: That Spongebob still haunts me.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: You wake up and there’s a frozen Spongebob face looking at you through the darkness.
Brandon: It’s in your bed.
Eric: Yeah!
Amanda: I’m just confused about the order of operations, you have to get the gumball and counter it before the pop is done. So what do you do? Do you just like hold it in your mouth like a chipmunk?
Brandon: I don’t know, Amanda, no one knows!
Amanda: Do you bite it and then spit it out and then litter?
Julia: No I think you just chew it while you eat the ice cream.
Amanda: Oh man I would choke on it in four seconds.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: I don’t think that they thought about the order of operations, they’re like [grunty voice] UUGH I GOTTA TURN RAPHAEL INTO AN ICE CREAM!
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: That’s how the business meetings went [forced grunt]
Eric: [More grunting in his voice] EEEHHHH WHAT DO WE DO?
Brandon: There was also a lot of grunting.
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: Oh no… Let’s steer our ice cream truck back onto the Afterparty road—
[Julia laughs]
Brandon: Nice.
Amanda: Eric, tell us about this obstacle course!
Eric: You know the obstacle course was actually taken from something we recorded a really long time ago. We were trying to do a podcast bundle with Humble Bundle, do you remember this?
Amanda: Yes, sort of an idea for a can’t do a live show, but maybe we can band together a bunch of people, and split the profits among everybody who was in it.
Eric: Yeah this was like two years ago, before Multitude really started touring. Also I think people really started getting their shit together. Like now there wasn’t a monetization plan for any sort of podcast, so we were trying to get a bunch of dnd shows to come together and maybe some fiction shows to throw some stuff on and we recorded this one shot that was a heist. So this was where I first learned about blades in the dark, and I really tried to use their circle system where you have pieces of pie to represent how things are going. And then it was a heist with a, you know how like at a carnival, it’s not like American Ninja Warrior but at a carnival there’s like these obstacle courses you could just run?
Julia: Yeah the blow up ones!
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah! Like those foam ones, or like they’re blown up and you just run up and run down so yeah there’s this news article I read where someone heisted one of those—
Brandon: WHAT?!
Eric: And I thought it was the single funniest thing— Brandon you’ve recorded this.
Amanda: You played it!
Eric: I don’t know where you went—
Brandon: No I just didn’t hear about the news article thing.
Eric: Yeah, I told you it was based off this news article that someone heisted one of those from a carnival so I’m like that’s the single funniest thing I’ve ever seen, so the fact was you had to get this thing back from some salamanders or lava monsters. Then one of the endings was if you got caught, you had a challenge to go and run this obstacle course. So I had this idea of different challenges to do it, so then I adapted it to this thing. So it was just really fun to be able to do it, now if this became more American Ninja Warrior than carnival obstacle course, which I am very glad for. Because it really kind of stretched so much of what I love about Laketown City in so many directions, you’re in like the hipster area of your city, and then someone throws on a light switch in a warehouse and oh! There’s an American Ninja Warrior set there!
Brandon: If that happened in Bushwick I literally would not be surprised. I would be like yup, that is correct.
Amanda: Everyone’s a drag queen, it’s EDM, and we’re eating LSD popsicles.
Eric: It’s right after the knickerbocker stop.
Brandon: PBR everywhere.
Julia: So many cans of PBR.
Amanda: Incredible.
Eric: There’s a stage on one side and an American Ninja Warrior set on the other side.
Amanda: So did each section of the obstacle course have its own mechanics?
Eric: Yeah! First we can talk about how I did set up different people for all of you to recognize in episode 3. So you remember I made you guys make all of those perception checks? So depending on what you came up with, you were going to see different things. There’s actually a bunch of things you guys didn’t see but one was Shannon Redwine the bully, one was Fritz—
Julia: Is she ever gonna come back? I’m just very curious.
Eric: Who can say? Who even knows?
Julia: Damnit.
Eric: And then Amanda rolled so well that you got both Fritz and the horse in the room. I was just gonna give a bonus to somebody seeing that there was a horse, and then Brandon you just got your interaction with Sour Anthony.
Brandon: The best of all.
Julia: No. Unacceptable.
Eric: My favorite voice of all time.
[Julia and Amanda groan]
Brandon: Okay, actual question. I’ve never watched American Ninja Warrior. Is it just like the same obstacle course that all the contestants compete on?
Julia: Yes, not at the same time though. Each one does a trial run, and then their goal is to get to the end the fastest.
Brandon: Ahhh okay!
Eric: Yeah, it’s like a time trial thing. But it’s also about endurance and upper arm strength, this was like just do it. It was a lot more like Wipeout, or you know like the Japanese inspired games that inspire Wipeout. Just like do it, and see where it goes.
Brandon: Oh so they’re not fighting each other on the course.
Eric: No, not like that usually. So yeah! I had different things for that, then Emily challenged all of you to do this which I just thought, listening back to the end of 3, I forgot how funny it was that Emily just says “go!” and you have to go.
Julia: We all just ran. We just did not want to lose.
Amanda: In episode 4 exactly, I think one of us was like “I don’t even know why I wanna win but I wanna win!”
Brandon: Someone says go, you gotta win!
Eric: For Val it was just like FUCK Sour Anthony!
Julia: Eric, I’m curious is there was a way if there would have been additional people running the course or if that you just planned on these specific people running it. Like was there a way that Shannon Redwine ran the course?
Eric: Oh 100%!
Julia: Okay interesting.
Eric: Just the way that you all interacted with these people, and the fact that you didn’t interact with Shannon, there was another thing you could’ve ran into a friend from high school, or from a job you ran into, and there were some other NPCs just scattered in there. But the fact that you interacted with the people that you interacted with, they were the ones who had a reason to stay like Emily’s speech for everything that it sets up for my world, that it was an exposition speech is not that compelling I don’t think. She’s not an aurator, she’s not fuckin’ like Professor. X being like “the mutants we need to all stand together!” She’s not that!
Brandon: She did have a giant purple sword though.
Eric: She’s like low grade Leslie Knope with a sword, and that’s not inspiring. So the fact that people were leaving was just like, I don’t wanna deal with this, I don’t care, or I don’t want to. Which is kind of what she was talking about.
Amanda: Did you do it that way, or did you roll for Emily’s persuasion or charisma.
Eric: I think I did it that way. I didn’t write anything down for a speech, I was like I’m gonna make up a speech to empower people, and it’s not gonna go well.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: So if I had spoken to Shannon Redwine she might have run the course?
Eric: Oh yeah, Val talking to their bully would’ve engaged somebody to challenge each other so I can only imagine that Shannon would’ve stayed.
Julia: That’s fair! Now I regret not talking to her.
Eric: I mean would you really have gone up to your bully after not seeing them for ten years.
Julia: No most definitely not. But I would like to have seen where that story thread would have gone.
Brandon: I bet Val would’ve, I mean Val’s like big and bulky and can fight now.
Julia: No but I don’t think so cause I think Val is the kinda person who wouldn’t give someone not worth their time the time of day.
Brandon: That’s true, that’s true.
Amanda: Love it, Val’s truly like my business goals in terms of being like “if you don’t wanna work with me, fuck you.”
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: That’s how I solve problems! I just don’t talk to people I don’t want to talk to.
Brandon: I don’t have problems. I just don’t talk to people, it’s really effective.
Amanda: Eric, any mechanics from the different sections from the obstacle course that you would like to share with us?
Eric: Yeah! The first one was just ripped from American Ninja Warrior, dexterity, acrobatics, jumping from one pad to the other pad and slipping and having to start over. The army crawling, see I totally thought that at least two of you, and at least Aggie was going to make it to the tunnel first just cause I know Aggie has super high dexterity, and then Milo decided to fuck all that up. [laughs] And so—
Amanda: The spirits decided, Milo just intended it.
Eric: Oh I’m sorry it was the spirits!
Brandon: No that was me, it was the player.
Julia: It’s a really Brandon the player did us all a favor in coming to the tunnel.
Eric: Exactly, so two other guys bust out in front, and then they got hit by the sleep spell. Like it was just sleep and I rolled a d8 and they got knocked out.
Julia: It’s very good.
Brandon: Wait eight d8?
Eric: Yeah eight d8, the way that sleep works is that you roll their HP and it’s usually for like you’re fighting goblins and you do it in an area and you go from the person or the creature that has the lowest HP up, so it has to consume their HP for them to fall asleep.
Brandon: Gotcha.
Eric: You roll a certain number of dice and you get like 40 so it’s like you have goblins, and one goblin has like 5 HP but the rest have 10, you knocked out the hurt goblin and then the other goblins that are inside of that number. It’s math.
Brandon: It’s math! [laughs]
Eric: So yeah, I thought that was fun, and like some of them had chunkier HP, like Fritz had a lot of HP and Sour Anthony did not have a lot of HP so them as a combination was really good. And that was done by Enya which Aggie then destroyed.
Julia: Destroyed the Enya, how could you?
Amanda: Can’t abide Enya.
Brandon: Hey Eric, what was Sour Anthony eating?
Eric: I told you, it was Chex Mix, Brandon.
Brandon: Okay…
Eric: I even wrote about it and said it was Chex Mix.
Julia: Do you wanna hear my theory about Sour Anthony?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Please.
Julia: So I know that Eric is a fellow watcher of My Hero Academia, and there is a very specific character, minor character, but in one of the character’s classes where he eats sugar and then gets super strong. And I’m picturing Sour Anthony eating snack food and then that allows him to fly. That’s my guess.
Amanda: Cool, I wish that happened to me.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Just like housing cookies and then he can fly.
Julia: Yeah! That sounds great!
Brandon: That’s the dream!
Eric: Yeah, you’re right, I’m changing it, it’s cookies. He’s eating cookies Brandon.
Brandon: Okay!
Julia: Great!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [Kermit voice] Hey man just like these are my chocolate chip cookies, I got these from home so don’t touch them. I made them, and I browned the butter, and I got sugar from out of state, it still has all the molasses in it they’re just mine and I would really hate — can you just step away? I brought them from home.
Brandon: And then he takes the—
Amanda: NO! The Afterparty is my house I don’t have to let this happen!
[Brandon and Eric laughing]
Amanda: Moving on! Any final mechanics please.
Eric: Yeah there was the don’t say anything at all puzzle which you say something nice to the door or you would run into a trap. It was just something that I got from the old, like old Wipeout episodes, either your bust through a door that has a trap in it or you don’t. The floor is an illusion thing which you guys figured out, and then the final thing where you guys needed to do something that was related to your class as you hit the punching bag.
Julia: Ahhhh!
Eric: So Val hit it just like you do a big barbarian punch, Brandon hit it with a spirit surge, and Aggie you just kinda like kicked it but you had to do like a monk thing but you figured it out.
Julia: There we go!
Amanda: Right on.
Brandon: Were there any rejected modules or tasks?
Eric: Yeah the problem I remember running it was I did too many athletic ones, because that is what American Ninja Warrior is. So I’m like you have to run up the warp wall! Then I’m like oh we’re just gonna run athletic checks, like this is not interesting.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Val would’ve come in first the entire time.
Eric: But like that’s what we did the first thing was a body thing, then the other things were powered or resistance or arcana, all these different things so that’s what I had to tweak.
Brandon: Smart!
Amanda: Speaking of play-testing, something we meant to discuss last Afterparty is that Eric worked with some consultants in preparing the world, and preparing for episode one. So we just wanted to shout them out and talk a little bit about that experience, so Eric, take it away!
Eric: Absolutely! I just wanted to say that Join the Party is really difficult for me to do on my own and I would not be able to do it, because 1: I need to talk to other people, but 2: my experience as a person and as a game player is not the be-all and end-all. So I really wanna shout out the people I’ve reached out to, so Celeste Conowitch who is from Venture Maidens and is just incredibly talented is now a full-time game person on their own and they do consulting for your tabletop roleplaying game podcast whatever, and you can just hire her she is incredibly talented. And I reached out to Kevin Snow as a sensitivity consultant, and a disability reader, because this was about bodies in so many different ways like these people are being radiated by science which is a thing that happens in real life, and doesn’t give you powers? Since it had to do with people’s bodies like Milo literally has a hole in his body and Val vibrates a lot, so I feel like I needed to talk to someone about what effects this might have on people and being cognizant of not being like “oh hell yeah! These bodies are better!” and the separation between the X-Men-style mutant and the regular human, and how that dichotomy is not real. Also like the effects if there are curses and effects, like quote unquote curses and effects of feedback for being a person who comes from a tradition of radiation. It was something I really wanted to be aware of and now that we really were cognizant of what we were doing for Join the Party I reached out to Celeste and Kevin. You can find them in the links that we put in the episode description, they’re both really great, and I just wanted to shout them out!
Brandon: That’s great! Thank you both!
Amanda: Thank you both! So let’s move now into questions from our wonderful, wonderful audience. Let’s go back to episode three, walk our minds before the obstacle course before all of that, this is from Noelle K. desperately needing to know everything about the Brewpot family please and thank you.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Honestly, I should be asking you three because I came up with one guy, then my interns apparently came up with Brewski so please tell me!
Amanda: Listen sometimes if you’re not careful, you devolve into a Long Island lax-bro and that is just what happened to me in that moment.
[Julia and Brandon laughing]
Julia: Yeah I think we talked about this off-mic, but I think I pitched the idea that Brewski had a band that Val has seen live.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: I can’t remember which band it is but it’s on my list of bands and I just haven’t looked at it in a while but yeah. Brewski is in a band that plays in college towns quite a bit.
Eric: He’s like a senior at SUNY LTC and it’s been like six years and he still hasn’t gotten his physiology degree.
Julia: Oh bud, oh bud.
Eric: No it’s just Mr. Brewpot is so — I love and I’m getting this from nad-pod but like I like putting dads into the podcast. It’s very fun, it’s just a really intense energy you can run at someone with and it’s like if a dad gives you a quest, you have to do it. So that’s how I dealt with Milo like hey your boss who is also your dad in some other way is like here, go do this thing, I’m telling you to go do it. No I just really like it.
Julia: That was one of my favorite scenes in episode three was Brewpot speed walking at Milo and Brandon being like “I speed walk back at him!”
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: Loved that!
Brandon: Just for the audience's sake, he’s not actually my dad.
Julia: Mhm, he’s not!
Eric: No we know who your dad is.
Amanda: But Brandon have Milo and Mr. Brewpot gotten drunk at a holiday party?
Brandon: Absolutely — well Mr. Brewpot thought Milo got drunk but Milo is a very smart employee who just gets his boss drunk and pretends to be as drunk so they can bond and then become the favorite employee.
Julia: Like all employees do.
Amanda: That doesn’t surprise me.
Brandon: Yeah! You gotta stay like one or two drinks behind your boss at the happy hour. That’s just the smart thing to do.
Amanda: Not bad advice.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): [In a drunken voice] MILO! If only I can rearrange the alphabet and make it so much easier for people to find all the science! It would be SO much better!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): [With a southern twang] WHY IS G IN THE PLACE THAT IT IS?! It should not be there! I’ll put it at the end!
Brandon: Is he a country lawyer when he gets drunk?
Eric: Yeah oh 100%!
Amanda: Oh that is very good.
Julia: That’s so funny what a weird complaint.
Eric: He went to a college in Charlottesville and that’s why he picked it up, like whenever he gets drunk he gets a southern accent.
Amanda: Amazing. Shel in the discord had a really interesting comment that they were going to ask whether other people were aware of the powered people’s powers, but it seems like episode three did kind of get at that like it’s some awareness and some people do use their powers.
Julia: Well I think that was something that we talked about in the world building was that people know they have powers, but the world at large doesn’t necessarily know that people have powers. That’s why you had that scene with Tegan where they’re interviewing you and trying to get information about the incident.
Amanda: The reason I think Aggie was secretive about that was not because she wants to totally deny the fact that she’s different but the fact that you kind of don’t go outside the family. Like you don’t talk about personal stuff with an outsider no matter how cool their jacket is.
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: Mhm, of course.
Amanda: So that sort of, if I remember correctly that was kind of the framing question that all of us had when we had our initial discussion of what campaign two would look like. You know powers, sort of like in the dichotomy of superhero empowered media. The question is sort of how secret is this? Are you a public superhero so that everybody knows that superheroes exist? Or did you get struck one day with a power and no one else has that or knows about it?
Brandon: Yeah I think it’s also interesting to note that we’re living in a town that’s already kind of odd, because the diaphorum you know. So it’s like everyone in the rest of the world has to be like, everything happening in Laketown City is just kind of odd in general.
Eric: Right, it’s like hey I really love going to Atlanta, it also has like all of the nuclear reactors in the United States, like that’s really strange.
Amanda: This is a related question from JamieDWN also in the discord, are there third generation post-event kids, like team JTP’s nieces or nephews or actual children? If so, are they powered? Do the powers dilute over generations etcetera.
Eric: That’s an interesting question…
Julia: I think this is another conversation we had off-mic when we first were coming up with the idea. Didn’t we talk about the powers would get stronger as generations go on? Cause like if you look at Aggie and Val, and I guess to a certain extent Milo—
Brandon: Wow.
Julia: These aren’t like huge incredible superpowers like you see in the comics, we’re very mildly powered people in superhero lore terms. If you look at our parents too, it’s something that’s been brought up on the podcast, our parents just look very good and are very healthy, but that’s it. They don’t have powers.
Amanda: Yeah that was sort of the question around the incident in particular like what would cause people to be powered. We wanted very much to take place in that second generation not the people who are dealing with it for the first time, but once the city is established the diaphragm is established, how do you live a normal life with just this strange addition? So adults who were exposed they have this mild effect of just health and prosperity which is great, but their kids because they were changed on a genetic level versus the parents were already alive and in bodies that had developed, they had a much more intense power. But I don’t know like if two powered people have kids like is it a genetic related thing? Is this a blip and powers fade from here on out you know, I don’t think there’s a canonical answer but it was really interesting.
Eric: I actually didn’t think about this until Jamie brought it up but theoretically you’re all in your late 20’s someone probably had a kid so we don’t know about this baby, or five year old, or ten year old probably. They’re probably out there.
Amanda: More to come!
Brandon: Not one of us three, someone in the city.
Julia: Someone not related to our characters.
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: There is definitely someone who was from Laketown who is living in Laketown City, who got married at 18 and had a kid at 19 and that child exists.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I really liked that Julia, I didn’t think about that like on the X-Men Professor X scale. Like yeah there are no omega level powered people at this moment 100%.
Julia: No one is changing around reality like Scarlet Witch or doing Phoenix Force level stuff.
Brandon: YET! JUST WAIT!
Julia: Yet.
Eric: Just dropping an entire tornado on the city yet.
Amanda: But that is the kinda thing that Dr. Morrow would potentially do. So I think what interests me so much about Laketown City is that it’s a mix of the sort of ununderstandable wild superpowery type of powersource and science, and the fact that there is money, industry, and infrastructure to make sweeping airtram innovations is just a really fascinating complement to the existence of mild powers.
Eric: There was an idea that I had in the beginning that was like you have to imagine that someone’s parent walks in on them as they’re shooting fireballs in all directions and they’re just like “Oh! Why don’t you just turn it off? That’s what I do with my radiant smile.” Like mmm, it’s not the same guys!
Julia: Not the same at all!
Brandon: And that child was Mario.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: He had a flower.
Eric: Yeah that was Mario. I’m adding a fire thrower named Mario now, congratulations.
Julia: He’s from Little Italy, Val knows him.
Amanda: This question came directly from Eric: the music at episode three slaps, discuss?
Eric: Uh not just from me every fucking person was like hey the music ending in episode three fuckin SLAPS.
Brandon: Yeah it was pretty dope track, I’ve been because I’ve been doing Next Stop and other projects along the line, to help JTP get quicker in post I’ve been using a lot of pre-made tracks sort of like a music-supervision style. So I use a lot of stuff from the YouTube music library which is the library that YouTube allows creators to pull from that a lot of it is creative common zero license which means you don’t have to give an attribution, some of it is attributions so make sure if you use that, so make sure you use that. This track was called Nothing Yet by Spaz Cardigan and I don’t really know anything about the musician but I do really like their tracks, I downloaded all of them so I just have them on my computer ready to use. If you remember back in Labor Party, there was a I forget which one, I think it was the pastoral one where there’s like a running the cows or whatever it is?
Amanda and Julia: Mhm
Brandon: There’s a track and it’s got some stomping in it, that’s another Spaz Cardigan track. So yeah, I just really love them and you can find them on the YouTube Music Library if you search for it .
Amanda: And Brandon wrote an illegal amount of music for campaign one, more than a hundred tracks of environmental sounds and also music which you can now buy in our merch store! jointhepartypod.com/merch!
Brandon: That’s why I’m only using premade tracks for this season cause the cops came and said “that’s illegal!”
Amanda: Yes, he’s been banned. Mhm.
Julia: You’ve made TOO much music sir.
Eric: The FBI busted in and was like STOP IT!
Amanda: Moving onto episode four many very good questions, first of all Julia, this one’s from Al parent to two adorable cats in the discord. Julia, how did you bless Brandon’s dice and why?
Julia: Okay we can talk about superstition real quick if you’d like.
Amanda: Yes.
Julia: And Brandon doesn’t believe in dice superstition as far as I’m aware.
Brandon: It’s not a thing! It’s just statistics!
Julia: I think you need to cook your dice, I think it should always be resting on the highest number possible, that is my opinion! Brandon doesn’t really do that though, I just kinda hover my hands over his dice before we start a session. To try to channel some energy into them you know, to kinda give them good vibes.
Brandon: I do appreciate it. Because I think dice don’t matter, but Julia giving my general area and dice good vibes is very nice you know!
Julia: Mhm.
Amanda: And do we do that remotely now?
Julia: I try my best!
Amanda: Gaze upon Brandon and send him good vibes?
Julia: Listen, according to the science of Reiki which is
[a beat passes]
Julia: Wild… You can in fact send Reiki waves across the phone calls and the internet so I will do my best to send you good vibes over these calls.
Brandon: Thank you, I appreciate it.
Julia: You’re welcome!
Amanda: From HamiltonOtto, Eric was the table for Spirit Surge, a static ten possible outcomes as Brandon rolls them or is it the roll shifting as backfill as he lands inexplicably on results all the time?
Brandon: Like do you replace ones that have been used with new ones? Is that what the question is?
Amanda: Right.
Eric: I do replace them. I’ve had to do it a lot more than I thought I would have to.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: But yeah as soon as they get hit, I switch them out.
Julia: Oh that’s really cool, I didn’t know that! I thought like if Brandon rolls I don’t remember the number, another 4 whatever he’s gonna polymorph again or something like that. That’s very cool to know that they’re switched out.
Eric: Yeah just the way that since it’s a feat and not like a main tenant like a Wild Magic sorcerer I felt like I had a lot more control as the DM. Because Brandon was giving Milo up to the randomization gods and as like a facet of him as a person and whatever his powers do and how out of control they are sometimes I felt like I needed to not press my hand down on the scale but I needed to know what these things are especially cause there is as we’ve seen some sort of entity hid in that portal.
Brandon: I also appreciate that they have more consequences I guess is the word, but like in the Wild Magic table some of them are just like you know fluffy fun stuff. But it does make the game more interesting to be like— even if it’s not terrible, but like you know my legs were frozen. That just makes the game more interesting when there’s a challenge. Just to confirm Eric, there are half good things, and half bad things right?
Eric: Yeah! You got one of the good things—
Julia: The punch!
Eric: Unfortunately it happened now but you got the big hands.
Brandon: Yeah, it’s just confirming.
Eric: Big punchy hands!
Brandon: Just confirming!
Eric: Brandon I promise there are good things, also the polymorph thing wasn’t necessarily bad it’s just that Tuna failed it and Tuna was the closest thing to you.
Brandon: That’s fair, Tuna fails everything.
Eric: [Laughing] Not true! Tuna’s great and I could tell Brandon you wanna shit talk Tuna more?
Brandon: I don’t know, I lived with Tuna in life and in death is even worse so come at me.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: Oh my god.
Amanda: First the fuck cut, now this Tuna defamation, it’s gonna be rough for you in discord, Brandon.
Julia: I think that HamiltonOtto was also the person on Twitter who asked me why Val hates Sour Anthony so much.
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: Yeah that’s right.
Julia: You know what? I just kind of leaned into it so far so I went back and I listened to episode three to figure out why I reacted the way I reacted, and it’s cause Val said something about their mom being hot, and then Sour Anthony agreed, and that did not sit well with Val.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: So fuck Sour Anthony!
Amanda: Aw that’s very good.
[Eric continues laughing]
Brandon: I like that it’s like a thing in Laketown that everyone knows that Val’s mom is the hot, hippy, sculptor—
Julia: She’s a MILF!
Eric: [laughing] Who makes erotic scultptures—
Brandon: Yeah!
Amanda: She definitely made like a sculpture of all nipples that spells out “MILF”
[Brandon starts laughing]
Julia: Yeah! 100%! Should be in the not the MMFFC but the other museum the art museum.
Brandon: Truly a nightmare.
Amanda: Near Ga Ga! Eric how did the conversation between Emily and the people who set up the obstacle course go? This was from Joey but lots of people are very concerned, like who did Emily pay off to get this obstacle course constructed?
Eric: [Laughing] Amanda and I have been watching a lot of incredibly rich people shows recently like Succession and Billions like if you throw enough money at someone, they just do the thing you want them to do.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So if you’ve got these contractors to set this thing up, maybe it was the American Ninja Warrior people, maybe it was a sort of like obstacle course something else, I don’t know. Like hey here’s some amount of money, build this, and they’re like “okay!” You don’t have to ask them, like they’ll just do it!
Brandon: I mean the production folks from American Ninja warrior have to have some jobs in the off season you know!
[Julia laughs]
Amanda: And there’s this whole cottage industry of American Ninja Warrior training gyms and equipment and people who will like home build the climbing wall or will order it from somewhere so it doesn’t surprise me that either that or a sort of intense crossfit gym lent equipment.
Eric: Yeah you don’t have to be suspicious unless something is actually suspicious like if this is just a job, they’ll just do it.
Julia: Is Emily just super rich though?
Eric: Who can say, Julia.
Julia: Like is the Slaughter — okay alright.
Brandon: Her last name is Slaughter, she definitely kills people.
Eric: Brandon, that’s a real person.
Julia: She can kill people with a sword real good.
Brandon: No the real person doesn’t kill people, just the fiction person does.
[Julia laughs]
Eric: Emily Slaughter Prime is an upstanding citizen.
Julia: Yes will incredible dice making abilities!
Amanda: Well we have a bunch more questions about our world and what’s going to happen next but first I’m gonna have to refill this cookie/chex mix sweet and salty combo bowl! Be right back!
[Transition music]
Hey, it’s Amanda. Now, we joke a lot about cookies and Chex Mix in this Afterparty, but like a lot of people, baking has been a huge part of my life these past few months. And there is no kitchen tool I appreciate more than my digital scale. Baking by volume is SO HARD and MESSY, but baking by weight is EFFORTLESS, I realize this is not news to a lot of you, but it was to me. I LOVE pouring the ingredients directly into my mixing bowl and not dirtying my dry measures! I love pressing reset after adding each ingredient and not having to do math! I love guessing how many chocolate chips make up 200 grams! Welcome to the midroll. How do you like the cupcakes?

One of my favorite parts of playing a monk in D&D is problem-solving. Deciding when will be the best time to use my luck points and ki points, managing multiple attacks in the same round, optimizing for close-range versus ranged combat… it forces me to think about probability in a way not many other things do.

And now, back to the Afterparty!
[Transition music]
Amanda: I’m back, are you guys enjoying my Rick Martinez browned butter toffee chocolate chip cookies?
Julia: Oh they’re so good.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [With his mouth full] I put them all in my mouth
Amanda: Nooo Sour Anthony you’re not invited!
Eric: Oh okay.
Amanda: Not gonna lie to you guys, lot of question about Tuna physics.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Amanda: Malace in the discord would like to know, can Val see Tuna all the time now? Did Val see Tuna because they were carrying Milo? Can Aggie see Tuna? Just can someone give Tuna scritches.
Julia: I feel like the answer to these questions are revealed later, so can we add them to the “hmm! I don’t know!” section?
Eric, Amanda, and Julia together: Who can say?
Eric: Look Tuna physics are complicated, don’t worry about it guys!
Brandon: I don’t even know if I’m quite clear on who can see Tuna and why, I mean—
Amanda: I think we decided that once Tuna reveals themself to somebody, like lets themself be seen then that person can see them forever, right?
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: But I don’t think Tuna revealed themselves so there’s something extra.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Maybe because you were in a sandwich?
Julia: Yeah I think it was because of the contact that I was able to see Tuna.
Eric: Yeah that was the context of why Val could see Tuna. I will say later, just deal with it because it gets complicated!
Julia: Yep!
Brandon: Well everything surrounding Tuna is just mystery upon lies, upon mysteries, I’m used to it folks, strap in!
[Eric laughs]
Julia: So needy your animal familiar.
Brandon: They’re a dick!
Amanda: Vennik would like to know how does Tuna feel about regular cats? And will Tuna and Sushi (Aggie’s cat) ever meet?
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: Well first off you need to write that fanfic where Tuna and Sushi interact. That’s out of my hands, I don’t know what I’m supposed too tell you.
Amanda: We don’t know Sushi very well yet.
Julia: I feel like cats can see ghost cats, that’s why cats stare at walls and stuff, they can see other cats!
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Eric: Cats looking at other cats, but they’re spirits.
Julia: I think cats are just looking at ghosts all the time.
Brandon: Yeah, that’s a thing. Cats and dogs can see otherworldly spirits.
Julia: Yeah!
Amanda: In certain folklore it is!
Eric: I had a cat in my mid-twenties his name was Samspon and my roommates named Sampson with a p, because I was not there to spell-check it.
[Brandon laughs]
Eric: And Sampson would just look in corners and just look up and like chirp minimally.
Amanda: Aww!
Eric: Like bah bah bah bah! And I’m like huh, what’re you lookin’ at bud! And Sampson he just had an eye of his own so I think cats can see ghosts.
Brandon: Sampson would transform into a giant monster!
Eric: No! Sampson was just a cat. You don’t need to improve to make a cat even more creepy, they just do it.
Amanda: And how does Tuna feel about other you know mere mortal cats walking around?
Eric: I think fine? I mean no more than other cats, like I’m not improving upon, I’m just taking the general idea of a cat.
Amanda: Cats are ready-made for dnd.
Eric: Exactly, like I didn’t do much to Tuna, Tuna is just a cat.
Brandon: Tuna was just a cat that died and now is stuck to Milo and it’s a horror show for both of them. They’re just a cat!
Eric: No Tuna loves it, Tuna loves you so much—
Brandon: Tuna does not like me, Tuna likes my dad.
Eric: Tuna loves the fact that Tuna still gets to bother you.
Brandon: Yeah, that’s what Tuna likes.
Eric: It’s great!
Amanda: This is from OutOfCoalText on Twitter: Will all of Milo’s spells eventually go ghost? Will entangle become grasping ghostly hands is wall of thorns, wall of mildly disgruntled ex NFL stars?
Brandon: Uh second question, YES. Now it is canon.
Eric: The first one is literally canon, we do that later, I think that we’ve really been working on this circle of spirits a lot and we do flavor it later as we get further.
Brandon: Yeah agreed, I think the thing too about Milo is like it’s not strictly — it’s like powered by ghosts and spirits but like it is a manifestation of those individual ghosts and spirit powers that they had or have. So like when he did entangle and it was a grasping vine, cause one of the spirits might have had the ability to do plant tricks—
Eric: [laughing] Plant tricks,
Julia: Ah yes, plant tricks.
Amanda: Guys I thought I didn’t share that secret tumblr name with you why would you out me like that?
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: AmandaPlantTricks.tumblr.com
Amanda: [Jokingly upset] Aww no.
Brandon: But I think as Milo we’ll see but as Milo gets more and more control over his powers I think he’s able to like hone the spirits as opposed as to just like channel the spirits individual willpower you know.
Eric: You know what’s funny? Cause like that’s true for Milo but also from a dnd perspective it’s like you know I would like to reskin these to make it more ghostly, like yeah let’s do that. It fits the subclass we came up with a lot more so, the way that the druid — I’ve been thinking about this so much — the way druids draw their power from the environment and the way Milo draws is power is from this realm that he has a portal, so like you are literally a ghost druid. So your spells would be ghostly.
Brandon: Exactly. There are spells that are already flavored like pass without a trace as a shadow in the game already in canon in dnd, and we added some flavor to thunderwave in of it is like a Pikachu power but there’s some ghostly whispers at the end of it so we’ll continue to sort of go that direction. And shillelagh is just a silly power so we’ll keep flavoring that.
[Julia laughing]
Amanda: Speaking of the end of the episode, I just saw this from Julia, not this Julia—
Julia: Not me!
Amanda: Different Julia, on Twitter: what would’ve happened if only part of the squad finished the parkour?
Eric: Oh that’s a good question! I did have a situation laid out for that, I didn’t think I would resolve it on this episode because we don’t know what Emily is actually planning here. But like yeah, it was entirely possible for all three of you to not do this. To not have it done, honestly thought that Aggie was not gonna get it.
Amanda: Aha! I’m a monk!
[Julia and Brandon laugh]
Eric: You did it.
Julia: It was a big reason why I picked up Milo and carried him along cause I was like I don’t want to be on a team with Sour Anthony but at the same time out of character I was like I wanna make sure that Brandon gets on the squad. I hope he doesn’t fall behind!
Brandon: Thanks! Julia the real person is so kind to me, and Val is also real kind to me.
Julia: You’re just better than Sour Anthony so Val was like yes!
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: You’re a nerd but I appreciate you.
Eric: That’s totally fair, hey I have a question! Why did Milo give up the 10k for the key?
Brandon: It’s not as nefarious or weird I think as people might imagine it. Well one, as a player it’s just more interesting to have things like items over cash, but two as in character Milo has a good job that he likes. So he’s not hurting for cash you know? And Milo as a person is just his whole this is that he’s intensely driven by curiosity. That’s why he’s in science to begin with, that’s why he has a degree in that. So that’s why he would rather have the key to figure out the secrets surrounding the key and more about himself and these spirits first of all and 30% of it to the government for taxes so you know $7,700—
Eric: Wait why would you given cash given by a person to you and give it to a tax — you’re gonna declare a secret mission amount of money?
Julia: It’s income tax.
Brandon: Yeah when it’s over $5,000 and then you get audited like you’re getting screwed man.
Amanda: Just declare a lottery winning and other miscellaneous income!
Eric: [Laughing] I don’t think —
Brandon: If Milo gets audited he’s not going to jail!
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: Val’s just like
Julia (as Val): I’ll set you up with a good lawyer! He’s gotten a lot of people out of from under the IRS’ eyes so…
Eric: There’s an old saying that we have, it’s not the crime, it’s the taxes. We make sure that we got our accounts.
Julia: Tax evasion is a main reason people went away during prohibition! It wasn’t that they were breaking the prohibition law, it was that they were done up by the fact that they weren’t declaring their income.
Brandon: Yeah so if Milo’s gonna be a vigilante he’s not gonna also do tax fraud! So you know, $7,000 is gonna buy him a nice clunker of a car kinda thing.
Julia: It’ll pay your rent for a couple of months!
Eric: Yeah! $10,000 is a lot of money!
Brandon: Yeah like rent for a couple months or uncover secrets of inside spirits for a lifetime! You know?
Eric: That’s true. That’s a good point, don’t worry I’m sure that Emily is just gonna pocket that ten k and be like alright that’s fine.
Julia: No skin off her nose.
Amanda: Related question from Magdelena on Twitter: at this point in the campaign how well do you feel like you know your characters? And for Eric the NPCs is there every motivation in reaction like 100% clear to you or do they still sometimes surprise you?
Julia: Yeah I think it’s really interesting because the more we’ve played recently, the more polite Val has seemed to me—
[Brandon and Eric laughing]
Julia: In certain situations, and like it can be an aggressive polite but I think Val is more respectful than I gave them credit for early on. And I’m curious for people to see that and see the reveal but yeah they’re definitely surprising me in that sense.
Eric: I think it’s just Val interacting with strangers honestly. Like Val comes off as very hard-edged to strangers but you meet Val once and dog don’t worry, they’re cool, it’s fine!
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: I feel like there’s still a lot of room here for surprise, I think even into episode nine yeah, I mean anything can happen. I think this sort of core person of who Milo is and I would bet he rest of your characters we sort of formed when we were forming our characters in the beginning but like yeah I think Julia you said last ep you know you found out in the fact that Val went to college and got a communications degree you know. So yeah I think those things will still be there and surprise us as we go.
Julia: Mhm.
Amanda: I’m sort of the opposite as said last time, which is I feel like I know how Aggie reacts and the choices she makes but it’s sort of discovering who she is and what motivates her apart from the basic things I know already. It’s still happening as of episode nine I do feel a little more confident, I don’t have to ask myself what would Aggie do, I sort of am able to act in the moment but I feel like I still have a lot to learn about her which is a really fun place to be you know, only a few months into a campaign.
Eric: I feel similarly for the NPC’s cause like you gotta give people one motivation and one personality trait and then you go, but I’m still introducing a lot of people right now. So once I get to live in them a little longer, that would be nice and I feel like they’ll get fleshed out.
Amanda: Pizza related question from Jasmine in the discord: if the characters went to the pizza joint Val works in, what kind of pizza toppings would they ask for?
Julia: Mmmm. So Val does like a meat lovers with extra meatballs when they’re ordering from Dominick’s, but I think if Val is making pizza themself in their apartment, it is thinly sliced pepperoni that’s cooked so much that it curls at the edges and then a drizzle of honey on top.
Brandon: Hot honey or just regular?
Julia: Hot honey if they have it, but if you’re using spicy enough pepperoni I don’t think you need the hot honey necessarily.
Brandon: That’s fair, that’s fair. I discovered calabrian chilis that I added to my pizza, shit’s so good.
Julia: Very good!
Amanda: I think Aggie enjoys straight up cheese or a white pizza if she’s frisky.
Julia: Oooo.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia (as Val): A regular slice you can get it for a dollah!
Eric: In my head at Dominick’s it takes like 25 years for a new topping to be added to the menu.
Amanda: Yeah they have to like redo the handwritten signs.
Eric: Yeah exactly so I feel like it’s a strong movement like it was like
Eric (as Dom 1): MY FAMILY DIDN’T COME OVER FROM SICILY SO THAT YOU CAN PUT MEAT ON THIS PIZZA, THAT’S JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS!
Eric: And then like 25 years later, Dom 4 was like
Eric (as Dom 4): YOU’RE NOT GONNA ADD ANYTHING GREEN ON MY PIZZA! MY GREAT GRANDFATHER DIDN’T COME OVER FROM SICILY TO DO THAT!
Julia: Unless it’s basil!
Eric: Yeah exactly. So I feel like they only at Dominick’s is regular, pepperoni, and green pepper, and they’re just now experimenting with meatball, like meatball happened very recently.
Julia: Meatball and sausage got added at the same time.
Amanda: And mountain lobster, of course.
Eric: Mountain lobster of course.
Julia: Since the beginning!
Eric: That’s the part on it’s own, a part on it’s own.
Amanda: So to close out before our spoily corner, we have a few questions about the podcast making process which I’m always very excited to see and to answer! AkaAS in the discord asked how many episodes we’ve recorded in person versus remote.
Julia: Seven? Did we do seven episodes before we got stuck in our houses?
Brandon: Six or seven I think.
Julia: So yeah we recorded at least two maybe three remotely for everyone.
Amanda: Yes Brandon moved a few episodes in so we were able to record four in person, all together. Then the next couple Julia was in the studio with me and Eric and Brandon was remote; and then we took a little break and recently have started back up again. After the show came out we wanted to just like see how it was like and how you guys enjoyed it so then we’ve been recording recently all remote. Which is different but I think we all know each other well enough and we have the foundation of recording the world building and the first few episodes all together, and now I feel like it’s not a thing, we’re just playing the game.
Julia: Yeah! Absolutely.
Brandon: I think definitely cause we all know each other so well and we have played games, and recorded together that it just feels natural. Like we know when you know Julia’s gonna have a joke or something you know?
Julia: Thanks!
Eric: That’s true, I’ve really needed to prime myself before Julia winds up and does a joke. I do think it’s to our benefit that we do a podcast like I — shout out to all my streamer friends out there doing remotely and figured out, like Celeste is incredibly good at this and you have like the background and everyone has their little box. But like for podcasting it’s very nice for editing it feels like everyone is in the same room, and we all have the same microphones, so we all sound the same! So that’s very helpful.
Amanda: Icoocat from Twitter asks what we do to create the feeling of a real-world city, and how does living in New York City affect our playing LTC. I felt self-conscious during the world building episodes that we made so many references to New York, because I’m sure that like everyone who lives outside of it is like “ugh enough with the New York! With the TV and movies guh!” But that is the context that all of us share, and it was a really helpful analogue for oh we need the equivalent for this kind of neighborhood, or you know the experiences we’ve had in living in New York but also various cities, yes you have the downtown that’s empty on the weekends and blah blah blah.
Brandon: Yes and in the edit, Amanda too I agree with that sentiment so I try to keep it to the general stuff that we said so I think that was hopefully helpful.
Julia: And I think that even if we do include a lot of New York inspired stuff, Laketown City is canonically very close to New York so you see a lot of bleedthrough in cultures there. A lot of New Yorkers probably moved to Laketown City as it was growing, so you’re gonna see reflections like that in the city. It’s not like Boston, where Boston is it’s own city because it was founded before New York was and it’s not gonna have the same traditions and the same culture but because Laketown City is a new city it is going to be very much inspired by the people that move to it.
Eric: Yeah a hundred percent, also the fact that it is in Upstate New York and the relationship between Upstate New York and Downstate New York and New York City and Long Island is very fraught and weird. You can totally see what’s happening during all the quarantine news. Like the relationship between Governor Cuomo and our Mayor de Blasio, it’s really weird. The fact that LTC is up near Montreal and Vermont is a really big part of its nature and the fact that there is the tension between that city and New York City. And the fact that they’re connected by a high speed rail. Like there’s a literal port that takes these people, Tegan lives in New York City, like there are people around here all the time. We can’t ignore the presence of New Yorkers and New York City, it’s something that you can’t look away. Also as this thing grows, we are interacting with the environment and like seasons and nature of Upstate New York which we — I’m not gonna pull that crumb. You know if this was set in Washington we’d have the same conflict between Seattle and Portland, if we set it in Virginia we’d have the same issues with Baltimore and DC! Region is very important in what Laketown City is. They way that these arcs are gonna get set up is right now we’re in fall and we’re gonna go onto these other seasons! Hey winter in Upstate New York has a lot of fuckin’ snow.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: So get ready for some snow in the next arc.
Brandon: I’ll get my boots!
Amanda: Aggie’s up at 3:30 plowing it’s not a fun time for her.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Val has a shoveling business. Val’s just all about the side hustle.
Brandon: Milo has never shoveled his driveway once.
Amanda: The people mover really jimmed up in the snow.
Eric: So jimmed up.
Amanda: Vennik asks if we ever get so into character or so into the story that when arguments or awkward situations happen in game they spill into real life? If so, how do you handle it? And if not, how do you prevent it? It’s a good question.
Julia: I don’t think we’ve had one yet that I was mad at any of you out of character to be fair. I did look at Brandon during episode four and was like what are you doing? Why are you trying to mess with us?
Brandon: I’m used to that
Eric: You know guys it’s the spirits, not Brandon.
Julia: I was like this is getting really weirdly competitive guys, and we know we all have to be in the same team after right?
[Brandon and Amanda laughing]
Eric: This happened a bunch in the first campaign cause this was when we were first starting it. I think we talked about it a little before but spoilers for campaign one, when TR8C nearly killed Greg when he first met him that was like a big deal. I did not know how to deal with it, and I had to like stop and figure it out before Greg died. But you know we’ve been doing this for a while and a lot of it is like in the game I think that this is like a city game and the consequences are more real. Like we are people with lives and can’t just like do whatever because it’s easier to envision the consequences and repercussions of that which is why I’m excited to play this game in the way that it moves around. We’re in a lot of introductory stuff, and as we get farther I’m sure things will happen, so we’ll see.
Amanda: We also all know and trust each other and know that ultimately we want to make a great podcast with a story that we all care about and let our individual players and characters make choices that are authentic to them like it never would occur to me to question the fact that anyone’s trying to fuck up the podcast or like you know mess up the story or make life difficult for another character, that I think that trust if built over time.
Julia: And I think that we had a great discussion before we started the first actual play session where we had a conversation about trusting the characters and trusting the NPCs and being sure that Eric and also the other players at the table are going to put us in the place that we need to be. And by trusting each other and trusting the players, nothing bad is gonna happen in that sense. Like no one is going to try and fuck anyone else over.
Brandon: Yeah I think that’s a tough lesson for me specifically, and I think a lot of newbie dnd players is like getting rid of that suspicious of the DM and just letting them sort of put the pieces in place that they need to and understanding that they’re in the same team as you. I think I still struggle with that sometimes cause I’m a suspicious competitive person. But I think that’s something that’s difficult to figure out and I think that there’s also this balance that you have to strike if you’re going to be sort of chaotic in the way that Milo is with the randomness, you can’t be so random that it destroys anything in the world or with the other players or for the DM. There’s a really tight line of where that’s appropriate and how it can affect the story.
Eric: Or even just light being aware of it and being that kind of chaotic person and like knowing that you might get hit with a consequence or a punishment, not from the DM but from the world.
Brandon: Yeah that’s the point, I am never gonna get mad at Eric for turning Tuna into a panther you know? I know going in that that’s a possibility and if that’s gonna happen I’m just gonna have to deal with it.
Eric: I will say also and maybe this is like the advent of dnd content and how this has grown so much, but like it really is like TV and movies. Like if I emotionally devastate you, I just gave you a real good scene. Like don’t you always want the death scene the hard scene as an actor? Like you want your character to do weird and fun and hard and emotional shit? Like that’s how I’m really seeing it and I’m gonna throw obstacles in front of you so that you have fun. Creative actor fun with it.
Amanda: Yeah I felt that way when I told you about Aggie’s siblings, because I was like here are a lot of ways to devastate my character and I’m just gonna give them to you to have fun with because I trust what you’re doing and I also unlike my nature that wants no conflict and do a jigsaw puzzle in candlelight —
Eric: Can confirm.
Amanda: Having conflict in the game is what makes it interesting and having things to overcome. And now, spoily corner.
Eric: [In a singsong melody] Spoily corner, we can’t tell you yet!
Brandon: Who can say!
Amanda: Oooo, I like it! Joey: is Emily a Hexblade Warrior?
Everyone: Mmmmm who can say!
Amanda: I don’t know!
Eric: I will say, and this is going to be an answer that is going to give you more questions—
Amanda: YES!
Eric: Remember with NPCs and she is not an enemy but remember that I pull from all of the places, I don’t just pull from the Player’s Handbook, I pull from the Monster Manual, and all of the monsters. I can just make a stat block of one and they’re not directly related to the class. So you know that I love using that NPC like class guide that I found a while ago but like I have all of the Monster Manual and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes and all of these things I can pull from. So Emily may be a Hexblade Warlock but it may not be a class. Just to give you a heads up.
Amanda: Hmm possibilities! From OH! The whole Discord: Who is Emily and what does she really want?
[Eric laughs]
Julia: Hmmmm!!
Eric: Alright seriously she is a really neat lady, and she’s nice! There you go. Aw I spoiled the campaign.
Julia: She’s got so much capital and no one knows why!
Brandon: DRUGS!
Amanda: Who was driving the ice cream truck, why did they want to run Val and Aggie over? Where are they going?
Julia: HMMMM!!
Brandon: Hmmm who can say!
Amanda: Who can say?
Eric: Who can really say? I do love that and I didn’t talk about this, but the fact that Val punched an ice cream truck is so Val.
Amanda and Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Like this is how I do it, it’s my investigation roll! Punch an ice cream truck.
Julia: Yeah, obviously! Well if I put it out of commission I can then investigate it better.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Or yeah, Aggie thought was like there’s only a few auto body shops in town, if an ice cream truck shows up a dent one we’re gonna know which one it was.
Eric: I also like how people are just shipping everyone with everyone now, in the discord it’s just ship city. It’s like fuckin’ Athens up in this piece.
Brandon: TUNA WITH MILO, TUNA WITH VAL, TUNA WITH AGGIE!
Julia: Oh gross…
Eric: Fritz and Emily, Fritz and Aggie, Aggie and Tegan, Tegan and Tuna? What?!
Amanda: That means we’re real property.
Eric: Yeah exactly!
Julia: Someone said Val and Fritz, and I was like did they even interact?! At all?
[Eric laughs]
Brandon: I don’t think they did.
Amanda: Aggie very much wants to hang out with Fritz and brood over a beer, they’re just companions and I think that would be really fun.
Julia: Maybe you can call him next time during our next short rest.
Brandon: He’s shady, I don’t trust him.
Amanda: I’ll try.
Julia: I don’t not trust him, it’s like celebrities don’t wanna get recognized and he’s kind of a celebrity.
Brandon: Yeah but he didn’t use any of his powers, so what is his power? Why is he hiding?
Julia: That’s true, we did not see his power.
Amanda: Who can say?
Brandon: Who can say.
Amanda: Who can say! Thank you for joining us for another Afterparty, we love watching you live tweet, and live blog in the discord episodes as they come out. It really makes our day and our week so we will see you in one week, with the next episode of Join the Party. Bye guys!
Julia: Later!
Brandon: Byee!!
Eric: You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.
[Outro music]
Amanda: Ooo all in sync.
Julia: Sexy in sync!
Amanda: Backstreet’s back, alright.
Brandon: Is there any other kind Julia?
Julia: Uhh… The boy band. Also sexy though so.
Brandon: Exactly!
Julia: Here we are.
Eric: [Dramatically singing] Everybody
Julia and Eric: [Singing] Yeaaah!
Eric: I know that sounded sick. I just wanted to be part of it because I wasn’t involved.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Fair enough!
Brandon: It’s on brand though.
Eric: Thank you
Julia: *NSYNC It’s —
Amanda: Hey, hi, he—
Julia: gonna be maay! Sorry, Amanda, go ahead start the Afterparty.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: It’s all staying in now! In the cut."

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time, on Join the Party…
Eric: Our party tries to recoup after the wild day they had and go about their normal lives. But I guess nothing is really normal anymore… All three of them get invited to a mixer thrown by local busy-body Emily Slaughter at a cool warehouse in the hipster district. The mixer isn’t what it seems when Emily reveals her own power, her deathness with a glowing purple katana. More of the guests reveal their power including Sour Anthony, a glowing man with a wild voice, and a chill bro who can turn into different animals and speak. Emily gives everyone the opportunity to make $10,000 if they go with her on a mission to clean up the city, but first they need to compete on this America Ninja Warrior-style obstacle course, more like Lake Town City Powered Warrior! Am I right? Let’s get the party started.
[theme music]
[suspenseful techno music]
Eric: You are in a warehouse on the edges of hipster-ville, Emily Slaughter has offered money for you to take down The Nephews with her, but first y’all gotta run the weird obstacle course that she put in this warehouse!
Amanda: How big is this warehouse?!
Eric: It’s very like, it’s the size of a warehouse!
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: There was a horse there we didn’t notice right away!
Julia: It’s a big warehouse!
Brandon: At least the size of a horse.
Eric: Alright, I want everyone to start by rolling initiative.
Julia: I established in the last episode that I’m already in a rage.
Eric: Fine.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: So am I, I’m also in a rage.
Amanda: 18!
Eric: Like personally?
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: 11.
Brandon: 14.
Eric: Okay,
Julia: That’s a good roll for you, Brandon!
Amanda: Good job!
Brandon: Wow! It started off strong!
[Julia laughing]
Amanda: I’m sorry that you waste all your good rolls on initiative.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: That’s true, that’s actually 100% true.
[dice rolls]
Eric: HAH!
Amanda: Oh no, it’s that thing where Eric does something we can’t see, laughs and then types a lot.
Julia: I’m hoping it’s a 2 for Sour Anthony.
Amanda: Fuck Sour Anthony.
Julia: Fuck Sour Anthony!!
Eric: Alright, so the way that initiative is going to work for the obstacle course, because you’re not fighting each other, everyone’s going to be running the obstacle course at the same time. Your initiative is pretty much gonna say where you are in this race of the obstacle course but I’m going to basically read out what the obstacle is and you can all decide if you wanna make any rolls or if you just wanna go ahead and just fuckin’ do it. I can tell you what exactly it takes to do said obstacle, if you get stuck in a stage you will be hung back and you’re gonna be separated out of that part of the initiative. But everyone who’s on the same stage is going to go together.
Brandon: Cool.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Yeah so Emily starts by saying
Eric (as Emily): Last one there is a rotten egg!
Eric: Then just starts running and it’s that thing where like one person runs so everyone’s feet just go “huuuuuhhh!” And just starts running, so Aggie you end up breaking out in front of Emily and you are out in first. Emily is in second, Milo you’re in third, Val you are in fourth, and coming up the rear you have Gordon as a dog just a floppy basset hound running behind you —
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda: Awwww.
Eric: Sour Anthony is still floating, not as fast as you think he would and Aggie, you turn around and you see that Fritz was trying to break like trying to leave, but then his competitive spirit took over and so he's like
Eric (as Fritz): (in a lower gruff voice) Oh I’m a professional athlete I should definitely win this.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: So he’s bringing up the rear and hoofing it now, but he’s starting from the door so he’s pretty far behind from everyone now.
Julia: Impressive!
Brandon: Sour Anthony can propel himself while floating?
Eric: Yeah!
Brandon: So he can fly?
Eric: He can fly, but right now he’s just choosing to hover and it seems like hovering is less fast than running.
Julia: Interesting…
Amanda: I hope that Sour Anthony over time just evolves into Bitter Tony.
Julia: (laughing) Jesus.
Eric: Alright so the first stage of the American Ninja Warrior obstacle course STAGE ONE! Is just one of those I don’t know if any of you have watched American Ninja Warrior but there are those pads that are on a diagonal and you have to jump from one pad to another pad. Unfortunately though, you know how in American Ninja Warrior everything has water on the ground?
Julia: Mmmhm!
Eric: I don’t know if Emily just didn’t have enough time to set this whole thing up, but there’s like one pad you might have on the ground. You know like in cheer how the padding should be there but it’s really just hard floor, it’s like that.
Brandon: Seems fun.
Julia: Seems real safe.
Eric: Everyone’s gonna roll acrobatics rolls.
Amanda: Can I first cast sanctuary on myself?
Eric: Sure, what does that do?
Amanda: It basically wards me against any attacks or harmful spells, if they come at me they have to make a wisdom saving throw. If they succeed then they are immune from my sanctuary for a full hour, but if they fail they have to choose a new target or lose the attack or spell.
Eric: Cool, so what does it look like when you cast sanctuary on yourself?
Amanda: I’m the same way that there’s little sparks that kind of hovered between my hand and Fritz when I healed his bruise, it’s almost like it starts at the top of my head and kind of ripples downward as if I am being I don’t know, scanned but a laser, only instead it’s like a little rows of orange sparkles that are moving down my body briefly.
Eric: I like that you’re out in front going oh let me put my buff on and it’s cascading down. Yeah that’s intimidating definitely. Does anyone else want to do anything before we hit this obstacle?
Julia: I wanna Hulk-jump over them.
Eric: You wanna Hulk— how!? What exactly is that?!
Julia: You jump on the first one and then just like big squat and then leap over the rest of them.
[Eric laughing]
Eric: Okay! Val you can do yours with strength but your dc is going to be much higher than everyone else’s.
Julia: That’s fine!
Eric: Milo, what’re you doing?
Brandon: As we run up to the obstacle Milo’s eye color changes and he feels that—
Eric: Oh! He’s goin’ ghost!!
Brandon: He feels that energy pulse within him then center on his stomach and then casts entangle for the two people in front of me grasping weeds and vines—
Amanda (as Aggie): MILO!
Brandon: Right from the ground in a twenty foot square starting from the point within range—
Amanda (as Aggie): What did we ever do to you?!
Eric: OH TWENTY FOOT. Twenty foot square! Alright!
Julia: Jesus.
Brandon: For the duration these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain and a creature within the area must succeed in a strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends.
Eric: Alright so I think everyone’s gonna have to make— INCLUDING YOU! You know you’re gonna have to pass through it too!
Brandon: No I’m not, I’m gonna run around it, I cast it I know where it is.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Eric: [laughing] He’s gonna run around it.
Julia: I don’t know if you can run around it when it’s uh—
Brandon: It’s only twenty feet! It's not that big. I’m sure the people behind me probably also see it.
Julia: I like the idea of Milo—
Eric: Twenty feet is very— IT’S LARGE!
Julia: I like the idea of Milo being like I’m not gonna do this, and then walks around it.
Brandon: It’s like three red shells where the people in front of me don’t see it cause I’m gonna cast it right below them but the people behind me probably will see it as they come up and just run around it.
Eric: That’s interesting, okay so the three people in front as you pass forward what happens if they fail? Do they get stuck?
Brandon: Yeah they get entangled until my spell ends or they can use their action to make a strength check and on a success they can free themselves.
Eric: Okay cool, so let’s start by doing that the only people in front of Milo are Aggie and Emily. So let’s do strength checks for them.
[dice rolling]
Julia: I love that the competitive nature is coming out real early in this one, huh?
Milo: It’s not me, I can’t control it!
Julia: Suuure.
Amanda: [defeatedly] I got a 6…
Julia: Aww.
Eric: Well Emily also rolled a 1.
Julia: Oh jesus.
Brandon: So they had to beat a 13.
Eric: So yeah, I think Emily and Aggie are just sprinting ahead trying to break out and Emily is like
Eric (as Emily): Aw yeah! Aw yeah everyone wants to do this, this is so great!
Eric: Then all of a sudden in front of the obstacle, just grasping ghostly hands are coming up like
Eric (as ghost hands): [in ghostly tease] oh no you can’t go! [laughing] You’re not gonna be able to participate!
Brandon: They’re not talking—
Eric (as ghost hands): OooooooOOOO! Amanda (as Aggie): [sarcastically] Mr. I left before the ghost shit started happening, okay.
Brandon (as Milo): [panicked] I’M SORRY! IT’S NOT ME, I CAN’T HELP IT! I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S HAPPENING!
Eric (as Emily): Oh bullshit!
Julia (as Val): Suuuure.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [in a Kermit the Frog voice] Oh that’s bullshit! I just [garbled words]
Brandon (as Milo): I can’t control it!
Eric: A twenty foot square is very big and if you’ve seen American Ninja Warrior, you need to go to the entrance of it, so everyone who is behind, I’m gonna give advantage on being able to go through because it’s not like you can avoid it but I think that if you know what’s coming you’d be able to do it so I’d even say that everyone behind also is going to roll strength saving throws including Milo, with advantage.
Juila: So I have a question,
Eric: Yes?
Julia: Rage gives me advantage already on strength checks, do I roll double advantage?
Eric: [laughing] No. You’re gonna roll with advantage.
Julia: Ah damnit.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: So that is a 12? That’s a 12. I shouldn’t have blessed your dice before this.
Brandon: I know, I rolled an 18. It’s all Julia’s fault for blessing my dice.
Julia: Mmmhmm.
Eric: Alright so even before the obstacle course happens, Milo throws down this patch of ghostly hands and Aggie, Emily, Val, and Gordon the dog are all held there.
Amanda: God damnit.
Julia: Aww fuckin’ Sour Anthony, floated over it didn’t he?
Eric: Sour Anthony floated right over it, and as you’re all held there, Fritz just kinda like plows he lowers his shoulder and plows his way through.
Julia: Bastard.
Eric: So now Milo, Sour Anthony, and Fritz are all going to attempt the obstacle of jumping. Everyone make a dexterity roll.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Oh jeeze.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: Yep. I got a 5 +2 for a 7.
Eric: Alright so [laughing] immediately Milo you’re like
Eric (as Milo): Aw fuck these guys I’m gonna do that.
Eric: So you try to hop from one, then you hop to the other and immediately your feet slip off as you try to jump from one to the other.
Brandon (as Milo): Yup! This seems right!
Eric: You just beef it super hard
Julia (as Val): I don’t believe in karma but that was karmaaa!
Eric: You also take seven points of damage.
Julia: Ooooo!
Eric: You just go face-first on the not so soft ground.
Amanda: As we’re trying to take ourselves out of these ghostly hands, I turn to Val and go
Amanda (as Aggie): I like you bud.
[Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): Right back atcha!
Eric: At this point Sour Anthony just glides right on through, doesn’t even touch anything.
Julia (as Val): Hey that’s cheating!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [Kermit voiced] Oh hey! It’s literally the only thing I can do, I think it's okay.
Julia (as Val): That’s cheating!
Eric: And Fritz definitely hops from one to the other.
Eric (as Fritz): [in a low gruff tone] Oh that’s right I’m an athletic person.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Alright so now Sour Anthony and Fritz are onto the second obstacle, and the five of you, Milo, Aggie, Val, Emily, and Gordon the dog are all stuck here. And then Milo you gotta run back around.
Brandon: Or do it?
Eric: Yes you do.
Brandon: I mean, hang on, they didn’t tell us any rules, they didn’t say that up front.
Eric: Alright
Brandon: I have a way around that—
Julia: You wanna cheat your way through?!
Eric: You wanna hop— you have to hop back onto the thing so if you wanna try to hop back onto—
Brandon: Well I have other magic you know.
Eric: Sounds dumb and bad.
Julia: Magic sounds dumb.
Eric: Oh first before you do this, roll your spirit surge roll please.
Brandon: Oh! Yeah!
[Dice rolling]
Julia: OH MY GOD.
Brandon: I got a 1.
Amanda: HE GOT A 1! BRANDON! You brought this on yourself!
Eric: Alright, please roll a d10.
Julia: Jesus.
Amanda: Good lord…
Brandon: Oh it’s really funny.
Amanda: I know there’s no stakes at all to this but I still wanna win.
Brandon: I got a 3.
Julia: Uh oh.
[Eric laughing maniacally]
[Amanda and Julia joining in]
Eric:Oh you doofus, okay so the ghost hand that is coming out of your chest has now shot the grasping hands on the ground and you’re looking back you’re so satisfied with yourself and you beef it and take 7 points of damage. But the hand doesn’t go away—
Brandon: You’re putting a lot of cockiness on Milo that doesn’t exist.
Eric: I think Milo was pretty stoked with himself is that not true?
Brandon: No!! No!
Eric: Then why did Milo entangle people?
Brandon: He doesn’t have control over his power yet. It just happens. It’s cause he—
Julia: Brandon the player entangled people not Milo the character.
Brandon: Yeah cause he wanted it to happen in his head but he doesn’t know how to do it, it just happens cause the spirits understand what he wants so—
Eric: Do I control Milo as an NPC, you control the spirits that flow through him?
[Julia laughing]
[beat of silence]
Brandon: No I control both of them—
Eric: Alright so the spirits inside of Milo want him to win very badly.
Brandon: Yes!
Eric: So he shoots the grasping hands out and now the hand shoots directly below at Milo’s feet. It’s kind of like scanning him upwards and downwards, and unfortunately—
Brandon: Is this like a TSA pat down?!
Eric: You know it seems like it and you’re like
Eric (as Milo): Uh what’s it doing…
Eric: And you’re like
Eric (as Milo): Thanks ghost in my chest!
Eric: Then you start running and you can’t, you can’t move your legs.
Brandon: I’m just frozen?
Eric: You’re frozen in place.
Julia: Oh my god.
Brandon (as Milo): Great!
Amanda (as Aggie): Serves you right!
Eric: Unfortunately if this was initiative I’d say you’d be frozen in place for three turns.
Brandon: Three turns?!
Eric: For three turns!
Brandon: Can I still like do things?
Eric: You can still do things, you just can’t move. So right now you’re just in the middle of this obstacle course staying there. Do you want to do something else with your magic?
Brandon: Well that means no I’m not going to because I’m gonna try to keep them frozen.
Eric: Okay alright so now everyone is going to make strength saving throws you have to beat a 13.
Brandon: Mhm!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Alright well I rolled a 14, so I’m not even gonna try— actually I’ll roll, I get advantage on strength saving throws.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a 9.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Oh okay yeah, I got a 2 on the second one so…
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: I’ll spend a luck point and reroll that.
Eric: Alright.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: So total was a non nat 19.
Eric: Nice.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a 21 after rerolling
Eric: Aw hell yeah dog.
Julia: Ohh yeaah.
Eric: So unfortunately dogs have bad strength—
Amanda: Awwwwww
Eric: So both of you and Emily are now broken out so now you three are going to make your dexterity rolls to get past—
Julia: I would still like to Hulk-jump over.
Eric: That’s true, okay.
Julia: Um I actually, I’m gonna be nice. I’m gonna as I’m Hulk-jumping over —
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: I did good, don’t worry about me!
Julia: Great, I’m going to grab Milo and like throw him over my shoulder.
[Eric bursts out laughing]
Julia (as Val): I like you better than Sour Anthony!
[Amanda and Eric laughing]
Julia (as Val): So we’re gonna do this together!
Eric: Alright so first I wanna see if you can make the Hulk-jump.
Julia: Alright, can you tell me what the DC is or nah?
Eric: Uhh I’ll give you, what’s your strength modifier?
Julia: It’s a 5,
Eric: A 5 okay,
Amanda: Oh mine too!
Eric: Alright I’m gonna say this is a DC 18 roll.
Julia: Okay!
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Well I hit DC 18 on my first roll.
Brandon: Nice!
Eric: Alright, I’ll give that to you! Now I want you to make a slight of hand roll cause I think you’ll be able to grab a nerd, but I want to see if you can hold onto him so make a slight of hand roll.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: That is a 17 +3 so a non nat 20.
Brandon: NICE!
Eric: Hot damn.
Amanda: Ayyyy!
Eric: Emily got a 19 so all three of you now are just jumping like oh I know how to do this! You’re jumping from side to side—
Julia: Except me!
Eric: Val what does this look like?!
Julia: I just squat down real low, and my legs vibrate extra, extra fast, and I just leap to the last one.
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda: A standing leap?!
Julia: While grabbing Milo—
Brandon (as Milo): This is extremely impressive!
Julia: While throwing him over my shoulder.
Brandon (as Milo): I owe you like thirty!
Eric: That’s amazing, alright well you’re all moved on from obstacle one, and I’ll give you I think you’re out in front now. With Milo—
Julia: Hell yeah!
Eric: Cause that was pretty sick, and now Aggie and Emily, I’ll give you Aggie you’re out in front of Emily and you’re now done with obstacle one.
Amanda: Where’s Fritz?
Eric: Fritz and Sour Anthony are onto obstacle two!
Amanda: Gotcha.
Eric: Which you see there is like an army crawling tunnel in front of you, and it looks just kinda like a very oversized version of like those trampoline obstacle courses that you might have at a state fair that you can run through and it’s oversized so you have to army crawl through.
Julia: Ookay.
Eric: Is there anything that the three of you wanna do before you go in there?
Amanda: How does it compare to the dog version of the agility course tunnel?
Brandon: Thank you!
Eric: Thank you, it’s like that, yeah. Let’s say it’s like that.
Brandon: It’s like a dog agility course.
Julia: It’s a shame that Gordon didn’t get through the first obstacle.
Amanda: I know.
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: Poor Gordo, never thought I’d say that.
Eric: Can the three of you tell me your HP?
Julia: Ooo yes, uh 32!
Amanda: 24.
Brandon: 14!
Eric: 14…
Julia: Jesus.
Eric: Okay yeah so you’re coming up on the army crawling portion is there anything you would like to do you just wanna barrel through?
Julia: Hmmm.
Amanda: Can I do a perception check on the architecture of this challenge? So folks may not know that I have a power called superpower which means I get more details on perception checks of either floor plans or like building engineering.
Eric: It’s literally a super power.
Brandon: That’s very funny and good!
Amanda: But the problem is that if I pose as a super to get into a building that I shouldn’t be in I have to roll and if I fail I have to actually fix something in that building for that person.
Eric: Yeah that’s the only other way you’ll be able to get in yeah.
Julia: [laughing] That is extremely funny.
Amanda: But in this case I’ll make a perception check?
Eric: Yeah make a perception check for how this fits into the warehouse, that’s great.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: Ooo good, that’s a 19 +4.
Eric: Okay 23, this was definitely put in very quickly I don’t know if the person knows its up to code and if Emily did it, it’s like did Emily run this before?
Amanda: Right.
Eric: It seems like it’s still very new and nice. It doesn’t seem like Emily probably ran this before, it’s just like Emily getting it in there as quickly as possible.
Amanda: Okay, so do I see any obvious points of weakness where if I could say pull out one of the lincoln logs the whole thing would collapse?
Eric: Yeah you can see that if you look up there are some things that are hanging from the roof, I think there is one in particular in front of you, you see that there is a speaker that’s playing a—
Amanda: She rigged up an AV system?!
Eric: Yeah there’s a speaker that’s playing into the army tunnel it—
Amanda: What’s it playing?!
Eric: Right now it’s playing Enya which is like “sail away, sail away, sail away”
Brandon: That’s very relaxing.
Amanda: What a strange mood.
Eric: Yeah it’s incredibly relaxing.
Amanda: Julia looks so offended.
Julia: I’m so confused.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: I think with a 23 if you wanna ask one more specific question, I can give that to you. Are you looking to take something apart?
Amanda: Yeah, I think I’m going to try as I’m going through to pull it down on whoever’s behind me.
Julia: Hey!
Eric: Interesting, okay, I will give that to you as you go through because the way that it’s set up I just don’t think you have a good sense of—like it’s supposed to be a surprise as you go to each one. So I can’t tell you the next one but if you do wanna, I can give you advantage if you’re looking for something to fuck shit up.
Amanda: Sure. The four people I’d like to finish are Milo, Val, Fritz, and me and—
Julia: Same.
Amanda: I’m gonna try to kind of throw the tunnel so that I stay behind those guys but in front of the others.
Eric: I will say related to the speaker you see that it’s just like really cracked concrete on the floor except for one spot that definitely looks a liiiittle depressed.
Amanda: Okay, I’m gonna avoid that one.
Eric: Okay, do you other two wanna do anything? Milo you have two more turns of not being able to run.
Brandon: When Val moved me it didn’t break the spell?
Eric: I assume you have him over your shoulder?
Julia: Yeah, I think I’m gonna switch him over to backpack mode.
[Everyone laughs]
Brandon: Gotcha okay okay.
Eric: So now you and Val are synonymous at the moment, so you can still do stuff, you just can’t move your legs.
Brandon: I am going to use my wild companion and try to get Tuna back in this game.
Amanda: Tunaa!!
Brandon: I’m gonna say
Brandon (as Milo): Val this is gonna be weird don’t-don’t hold this against me, TUNAAA PLEASE HELP!
Julia (as Val): Why are you calling for a fish?
Brandon (as Milo): It’s my cat… Uh oof you’re not gonna be able to see them, it’s fine but they are there I promise!
Eric: Tuna pops up on your left shoulder. I would say Val you can see that there is now this really stretched out orange cat on Milo’s shoulder.
Amanda: So Tuna on top of Milo on top of Val is what’s happening?
Eric: Yeah! It’s literally a Tuna sandwich.
Brandon: So Val can see—
Brandon and Eric: [realizing the pun] OOOOOHHHHH!!!!!!
Julia: Jesus.
Eric: You almost ran over that joke!
Amanda: It’s open faced and Brandon is the cream cheese!
Eric: So now all of a sudden there’s a cat.
Brandon: So Val can see them?
Eric: Val can yeah.
Brandon: Oohh okay.
Julia (as Val): What—what is? There is a cat?!
Brandon (as Milo): You can see my Tuna?
Julia (as Val): There is a cat...
Eric (as Tuna): [Whining] I was stretching. I was asleep. What do you want?
Julia (as Val): This is kind of adorable.
Brandon (as Milo): Hi Tuna welcome back we’re in the middle of an obstacle course here I would really like your help maybe you can find some shortcuts maybe you could like I don’t know knock some people over, trip them, I dunno. Apparently Val can see you now, so maybe you can also trip some people who knows?
Eric (as Tuna): [Groggily] I just woke up tell me one thing to do also meeoow.
[Everyone starts laughing]
Julia: This is adorable.
Brandon (as Milo): Meow?
Eric: Tuna looks over at Val and is like
Eric (as Tuna): You can see me?
Julia (as Val): You’re extremely cute.
Eric (as Tuna): Thank you, that’s all I ever wanted—
Brandon (as Milo): Don’t Val, don’t, no no no no no.
Eric (as Tuna): Please Val, keep going I love it.
Julia (as Val): So adorable I will chin scritches after we finish this obstacle course.
Eric (as Tuna): I hope that is a thing that is possible okay—
Julia (as Val): I will try my best I am very strong.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric (as Tuna): Just give me one thing to do.
Brandon (as Milo): Can you just find like an, I dunno shortcuts or like an end obstacle course button.
Eric (as Tuna): Oh yeah, uh.
Julia (as Val): There’s also a terrible man named Sour Anthony if you wanted to mess up with him, that would be fine with me. I know I’m not your owner? I guess?
Eric (as Tuna): Listen nobody owns me—
Brandon (as Milo): Nobody owns Tuna.
Julia (as Val): Okay, nobody owns you, no one can own a cat I understand that. That is what my grandmother always said.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric (as Tuna): I am my own person. I’m so sleepy.
Julia (as Val): You’re also a cat.
Eric (as Tuna): I’m sleepy. Okay I’ll go check it out. Brandon (as Milo): Welcome back from being a panther bud.
Eric (as Tuna): What is that weird music that’s playing?
Julia (as Val): It’s Enya, and I don’t like it.
Eric (as Tuna): Oh is that why I’m so sleepy?
Julia (as Val): Yeaah. Eric (as Tuna): Don’t listen to that.
Eric: Then Tuna just hops off and kind of just disappears.
Julia: I’m gonna cover my ears before I go crawl into the thing.
Brandon: I’m gonna do the same also my symbiotic entity um when I awaken my wild shape I get 3 temporary hit points per level I have in that class so I get 9 temporary hit points.
Eric: Very good! Good job! Okay so the two of you are gonna go through.
Julia: Yes, with ears covered.
Eric: Alright, Emily is also going and is behind you, and you two are ahead.
Julia: Is Emily also covering her ears?
Eric: Uhh no, Emily is not covering her ears.
Julia (as Val): You made this obstacle course!
Eric (as Emily): I didn’t run it first, I ordered it!
Julia (as Val): You ordered it wh-where on the internet?!
Eric (as Emily): I’m just trying—I’ll just, hey listen I can explain to you later I can just go on ahead if you want me to.
Julia (as Val): Okay fine, nope, I’m going.
Eric (as Emily): Alright, cool.
Eric: So Emily tries to push past you, how are you taking Milo with you?
Julia: He’s on my back—
Eric: Oh he’s on like a backpack.
Julia: Yeah, and we’re just crawling.
Brandon: And every crawl he’s like
Brandon (as Milo): I won’t. Forget. That. You did this. For me. I promise! Thank you.
Eric: Okay, as you’re army crawling through, you’re about halfway through and you’re covering your ears as best as possible. The Enya is like getting louder, and you come out and you see like both Fritz and Sour Anthony and just laying on the ground.
Julia: Cool.
Amanda: Noo! I’m—
Julia: I’m gonna crawl over them.
Eric: [laughing] Alright that’s fine by me!
Julia: Yep.
Eric: Okay make just a strength check just to see how easy it is for you.
Julia: I get advantage on this!
Eric: Do it!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Alright that was a 14 which is a 19 and then a natural 1 so I am glad I got initiative.
Eric: Yeah with a 19 you’re able to just move on past as you go past them you two notice they’re both snoring.
Julia: Yeah that feels right.
Eric: Fritz has a like a real dad snore he’s like [deep snoring noises] but Sour Anthony goes
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hurr hmmm drrrmmm.
Julia (as Val): I’m very glad I met your cat because he gave me the idea not to listen to the Enya even though I wouldn’t listen to Enya anyway!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: I only listen to pop-punk covers of Enya, that’s the only time I listen to Enya.
Brandon (as Milo): Just don’t tell Tuna that, don’t inflate their ego, please.
Julia (as Val): They’re an extremely good cat.
Brandon (as Milo): It’s-it’s… They’re not.
Eric (as Tuna): Who’s always around cause I’m a ghost cat!
Julia (as Val): I love that.
Eric: Emily is less dexterous at getting pasted these two grown men bodies that are ahead so she’s stuck, so you two are now ahead.
Julia: Wooo! How’s Aggie doing?
Eric: Yeah Aggie, wassup?
Julia: I’ll come and get you.
Amanda: What is the tunnel made out of? Is it nylon like the good good border collie agility courses?
Eric: Sure yeah, let’s make it nylon.
Amanda: In that case I approach the sleeping heap, I am going to crouch up a little bit and yank the speaker out of the ceiling. But I’m also going to use a ki point to use step of the wind and dash forward as a bonus action.
Eric: So you’re inside of the tunnel and Enya’s playing, how do you want to do that? Because it is like a piece—
Amanda: Oh I see, it’s like an inset speaker?
Eric: Yes so it’s in the thing.
Amanda: So then I am going to punch it.
Julia: [excitedly] I was going to say punch it!! Punch it! Punch it! Punch it with your bare hand!
Eric: I’m gonna come up with an AC for a piece of electronic technology, which I’ve done twice in this campaign already now!
Julia: Mmhm!
Brandon: I’ll tell ya Eric, speakers are not very robust.
Eric: Nope! It is not high AC.
Julia: Hit it right in the drum?
Eric: Make an attack roll.
[Dice rolls]
[Julia gasps]
Amanda: That’s a natural 20.
[Everyone cheering]
Julia: Yeess!
Eric: Alright, just describe what it looks like.
Amanda: I want to punch the speaker out of its place so high that it goes up and with a Looney Toons falling sound, falls on the back half of the nylon collapsing the entrance to the tunnel.
Brandon: And there’s a tiny explosion.
[Brandon and Julia make quiet explosion noises]
Eric: Yeah it’s in the air and the speaker holds up a sign that says “Help” and it falls on the ground. Yeah absolutely I mean it's a nat 20 that’s exactly what happens. I think at that point you also hear
Eric (as Gordo the dog): Woof! Woof woof woof!
[Everyone awwws]
Julia: What a shame for a sad pup.
Brandon: The one thing Gordo could’ve done well.
Amanda: Ideally the hole where the speaker was like drapes over the heads over Fritz and Sour Anthony so they can still breathe.
Eric: Yeah they’re fine, they were just asleep but when you punch out the speaker the music stops, and Emily’s kind of stuck in there, but you used step of the wind—
Amanda: I do.
Eric: You’re just out and poppin’. Sour Anthony and Fritz both wake up and they’re all kind of tangled up together.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sorry guys!
Julia (as Val): Good job.
Eric: Alright uh—
Brandon (as Milo): I didn’t do that one I promise that wasn’t me!
[Eric chuckles]
[Transition music]

Alright, let’s get back to the show.
[Transition Music]
[Suspenseful techno music]
Eric: Alright so now it goes Val and Milo are definitely on ahead, Aggie is behind, and third Emily, Sour Anthony, and Fritz are kind of stuck in that big fourth section, and Gordon the dog is having some trouble there in the back.
Julia: Whoops.
Eric: Val, Milo you’re gonna go first here you run up to two doors, and there is a sign above both of the doors that say “or don’t say anything at all” and on both doors you see that one has the comedy mask, and one has the drama mask.
[Amanda and Julia groan]
Brandon (as Milo): Uh um okay, Val hello.
Julia (as Val): Hello…
Brandon (as Milo): One, I have an idea, two, I have a second idea.
Julia (as Val): I love ideas, especially two of them.
Brandon (as Milo): One— well I have three ideas actually, sorry.
Julia (as Val): Okay three, even better.
Brandon (as Milo): One, I have a ghost cat. Two, I can turn into a shadow, and three, maybe we should wait for Aggie and just do this together?
Julia (as Val): Why don’t we have ghost cat investigate while we wait for Aggie and then we pick a door?
Brandon (as Milo): I like this thinking. TUNA!
Julia (as Val): Aww the adorable cat is back.
Eric (as Tuna): [in a grumpy cat voice] I’m still… I’m just as sleepy as before but I think it’s for personal reasons.
Julia (as Val): That’s fair enough.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh my gosh.
Eric (as Tuna): Get it? Cause I’m a cat and I’m always sleepy. I should be napping right now.
Julia: I reach out to give chin scritches.
Eric: You reach out and your hand just goes through nothing.
Julia: I try to be even stronger in chin scritch.
[Everyone bursts out laughing]
Eric: You flex and then it still just goes through.
[Julia groans frustratedly]
Eric: [mimicking Julia] Why can’t I give this cat pets?!
Amanda: Their form is so ripped!
Eric (as Tuna): Mmmm whatdoyouwaaant?
Brandon (as Milo): Can you just check out one of these doors, or both of these doors and just let us know what’s behind them?
Eric (as Tuna): Sure which one?
Brandon (as Milo): Uhhh… What do you think Val?
Julia (as Val): [Hesitantly] Comedy.
Brandon (as Milo): Let’s do Comedy.
Eric: Alright, Tuna hops through and Tuna says
Eric (as Tuna): There’s nothing there, it’s just a door.
Brandon (as Milo): Well beyond the door did you see—
Eric (as Tuna): There are more doors.
Julia (as Val): Oh… There’s more doors? I don’t wanna be in a maze.
Brandon (as Milo): Not really that funny uh…
Julia (as Val): I hate mazes.
Eric (as Tuna): It’s just it’s the same thing right after that.
Brandon (as Milo): Just door after door after door?
Eric (as Tuna): There’s three yeah.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay um…
Eric: At this point Aggie is caught up and you can see behind, Emily, Sour Anthony, and Fritz are just pushing each other to get through and Emily is all
Eric (as Emily): I just think it’s really important for me to win because I really wanted all of us to do this.
Eric: And Sour Anthony is says
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [Kermit voice] No but I have great power so like I needed to show myself what I can do.
Amanda (as Aggie): You can call this off at any time, Emily!
Eric (as Emily): NO! I’M GONNA WIN IT! AND I’M GONNA SHOW ALL OF YOU WE’RE GONNA BE A GREAT TEAM TOGETHER!
Julia (as Val): So we’ve got these doors…
Eric: Yeah so Aggie is caught up, so you three are now firmly in first.
Julia (as Val): If you go through the Comedy one it’s the same thing through it.
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t really get it but I have an idea,
Julia (as Val): Okay!
Brandon (as Milo): I can turn us all into shadows, what do you think?
Julia (as Val): I would like to be a shadow, that seems kinda cool, I’ve never been a shadow before.
Brandon: So in reality this gives us a + 10 to stealth checks and we leave no tracks or traces of our passage. What does the sign say again?
Eric: The sign says “or don’t say anything at all”
Amanda: It’s hung over both doors?
Eric: It’s hung in the middle of both, it’s kind of hung as a banner.
Julia: I feel like there’s like a reveal spell thing, there’s some sort of secret words on the door?
Amanda: Does anyone know what lyric that it’s referencing?
Julia: Can I investigate the sign that says nothing?
Eric: Yeah! What do you wanna know?
Julia: I wanna see if there’s a secret message behind it or something… Ooo I don’t wanna investigate—
Eric: Why don’t you make an arcana check for this? Because this is kinda like it’s more like a mystery.
Julia: Also bad but alright!
Brandon: Can I try history or is it arcana?
Eric: Just make it an arcana check.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: That’s a 4 from Val.
Eric: Val, these are some nice words!
Brandon: 13!
Eric: 13…
Julia: There’s words though, we know that now.
Amanda: Can I do one more structural check?
Eric: Yeah.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: You wanna arcana too? How’s your arcana? Oh fff- jesus.
Amanda: I got a nat 20 again!
Eric: You got a nat 20 AGAIN?!
Amanda: Sorry that’s on me.
Eric: Oh my god okay so you can see that each one of these is sectioned off, like I said it’s not easy for you to see what the next one is. From what they had said, from what Tuna said is that this section seems only big enough for like three sets of two doorways three times.
Amanda: I see.
Eric: And you also think if the comedy door has nothing behind it, the other one probably has something behind it, also from your structural knowledge in the way things are put together. You wouldn’t just make the same thing, that’s like a teacher on a multiple choice test and the whole thing was A’s like no one would do that. So with a 13, Milo I would say this is attached to an axiom, you intuit there should be “... or say nothing at all”
Amanda: If you can’t say anything nice don’t say anything at all.
Julia: So nice. So go happy.
Amanda: That’s my guess.
Julia: That’s a good vibe, let's do it.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay yeah, I mean I can’t stop you Val, but I am gonna make us shadows if that’s cool?
Julia (as Val): Listen, I’m not gonna say no to becoming a shadow. Existence is terrible sometimes.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay fine.
[Brandon and Julia laughing]
Brandon: Milo thinks — hopes real hard
[Eric laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): I’ve done this once, I think I can do it again!
Julia (as Val): Okay, I believe in you bud, even though you can’t walk.
Brandon: and I cast pass without trace, me and all the creatures around me, my companions now have a + 10 to dexterity stealth checks, and I cannot be tracked except by magical means, and we leave no tracks or traces of our passage.
Eric: Alright, so now all of you are shaded and like shadows now, you’re skulking through.
Julia (as Val): This is extremely goth, and I’m into it.
Amanda: So we go through the Comedy door.
Eric: You open the Comedy door and you walk on through, and like Aggie said there’s a second one that looks exactly the same as the first one.
Amanda: There’s a choice of two doors.
Eric: Yeah there’s a Comedy door and a Tragedy door.
Julia: So I think we should do Comedy again right?
Amanda: Let’s do it.
Julia: Alright.
Eric: Okay, ummm.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Uh oh.
Amanda: Oh no he’s rolling something.
Eric: I want everyone to make constitution checks.
Julia: That’s not my specialty.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: God dangit.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 8.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: Oh my god.
Julia: It is an 8 for me as well.
Brandon: It was on the edge of 19 and then rolled a 3.
[Collective ohhhh]
Eric: So all of you, you walk through the Comedy door and there’s just tons of cobwebs as you walk through. It is just so nasty and all of you with an 8 are just literally just trying to hold yourselves together.
Brandon (as Milo): Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross. Gross.
Amanda: Uhhhh.
Eric: So you’re all kinda stuck in the cobwebs at the moment.
[Julia groans]
Eric: I want all of you to make perception checks.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: God dangit, that’s a 9.
Amanda: 15.
Brandon: 24.
Eric: Alright so hot damn, Milo you hear outside that someone’s selling hotdogs too, you also hear there’s an ice cream truck going by.
Brandon (as Milo): Y’all there’s a lot of snack vendors around us.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: So Milo and Aggie, you hear as the other three behind you are kinda fighting with each other as you’re stuck in the cobwebs and then you hear Emily say
Eric (as Emily): Hello left door! You look so nice today, right door I love your doorknob.
Eric: And then you hear the opening of the door and they’re running through.
Julia: Well that’s gonna make things a lot easier.
Brandon (as Milo): Guys I think I just heard Emily complement the doors? Which is a weird thing to say, not the band, the actual physical doors. I think we should try that next.
Julia (as Val): Oh no
Amanda (as Aggie): Your wood frame is very fetching!
Julia (as Val): Alright…
Eric: Alright uh—
Julia (as Val): I like the song Light My Fire!
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Oh wait not doing that one.
Eric: You look forward through the cobwebs and you see that the tragedy side on the third set of doors lights up blue.
Julia: Alright we go through that one.
Amanda: Yeah as soon as we can get out of the muck, that’s where we’ll go.
Eric: Alright so who do you think is your fastest person?
Julia: I’m 30 speed, you’re also 30 speed?
Amanda: I’m 40 and I also have step of the wind.
Julia: So let’s do you.
Eric: Alright we’re gonna have a dexterity off to see which group of people goes on through. You still hear Gordon who’s rummaging around, he’s having some problems.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Okay
Amanda: I got a 15 for dexterity.
Eric: I got a 5!
Julia: GOOD!
Amanda: Ayyy!
Eric: So your group of three are now out ahead Milo you can walk again, the shadow around your feet are gone but now—
Brandon (as Milo): Oh thank the lord.
Eric: But now they’re also, the three of them are looking around like
Eric (as Emily): Where did they go?
Brandon: I had a shadow around my—
Eric (as Emily): Did they run away?
Julia: Yeah we got so scared of the cobwebs.
Amanda: We look back and all of the cobwebs are intact again.
Brandon: AHHH!
Eric (as Sour Anthony: Oh hey man, I can look around and fly around to see if I can find them.
Julia: Yeah he should do that [whispering] waste time.
[Everyone laughs]
Julia: Waste time, Sour Anthony! Waste time.
Eric: Alright you are now on the fourth obstacle, and it seems to be a raised platform, there are stairs that go up onto a raised platform that goes on for thirty feet, and then there are stairs that go back down. Kinda like a stage where you go onto a raised platform through stairs and then you walk through but it doesn’t seem like there’s anything there but you take the stairs down.
Julia: Don’t like that.
Brandon: Well I mean we’re shadows, they’re not gonna know that we went up there, so why don’t we go up there see what’s up there, and if we need to I’ll kill the spell if we need to.
Amanda: Alright.
Eric: Are you just gonna go up on the raised platform?
Julia: Yeah
Brandon: I also have stealth checks so maybe we do it stealthily!
Eric: If you wanna do it, you wanna do it stealthily?
All: Yes!
Amanda: We should go on the outside of the steps, that’s my professional recommendation.
Julia: Yeah the outside of the steps.
Amanda: Cause the middle is creaky.
Eric: Alright let’s do the uh, who has the highest stealth?
Julia: I’ve got 1.
Amanada: Uhh I have 5.
Brandon: I have + 2.
Amanda: + 10 for all of us.
Brandon: So you have + 15?
Amanda: Yeah.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Aggie why don’t you roll on that.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: [Excitedly] I got a 27!
Eric: Hot damn alright, yeah they have no idea where you are, you might as well literally be the walls.
Amanda: I recommend that we go up the side of the staircase because it’s the quietest and if there’s any kind of proximity trap that’s triggered by us going up the middle of the steps I want to try to avoid that.
Julia: We follow Aggie!
Eric: Okay everyone make a dexterity saving throw.
Julia: [Quietly] aw, good.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Is it a trap? Did I sense it?
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 15.
Brandon: 18
Eric: Actually, yes you’re right! You do have danger sense! Remind me of danger sense again.
Julia: Advantage on dexterity saving throws for effects you can see such as traps and spells.
Eric: Effects you can see…
Julia: Traps and spells.
Brandon: This is the thing about danger sense, how do you see a trap?
Eric: Exactly.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Alright, I’ll give you advantage on that.
Julia: Okay.
[Dice rolls]
Eric: Brandon you’re helping someone in the future.
Julia: Oh thank sweet baby jesus, a nat 20!
Eric: Nice! Wonderful, yeah so as you all start walking up and you’re sticking to the side and Val you lose your footing for a moment, you dangle your foot out and you realize as you put your foot out to touch the actual platform there’s just nothing there.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: But with a natural 20 you gather yourself and all three of you are now scooting on the side.
Amanda: So we’re just walking across a blank platform?
Eric: Yeah but you have to — yeah you’re like walking on a stage but all of you are pushed up against the side, just scootin’ through.
Julia: Like a cliff.
Amanda: Alright.
Julia: Alright, cool cool cool.
[Dice rolls]
[Eric laughs to himself]
Eric: Alright you see the other group of three go by, they immediately just run up the front of the middle, Emily stops herself like
Eric (as Emily): Wait a second this doesn’t make any sense.
Eric: Sour Anthony is just floating, like he’s just floating and Fritz just puts his foot down and just falls into something. He’s like
Eric (as Fritz): Ahhh!
Eric: And just falls. Alright you are now at the final obstacle there are three punching bags there and each one says “Hit Me!”
Julia: [Without missing a beat] I hit it.
Eric: You just hit it?
Julia: I hit it real hard.
Eric: You hit it real hard?
Julia: I hit it real hard with my fist.
Eric: How do you demonstrate that you hit it real hard.
Julia: I just rear back, big fist—
Eric: Big fist!
Julia: Vibrate even more and then big punch.
Eric: Alright, I want you to make an attack roll.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: So it’s a 13 and then I add 5 plus my proficiency so it is a non-natural 20.
Eric: [Laughing] Well it’s a punching bag, so you definitely wallop it. I want you to make, what stat would you use to display your power here? Of you punching it super super hard.
Julia: I think it’s just athletics or strength? Or intimidation even maybe?
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Okay, okay, so how do you intimidate the punching bag when you do it?
Julia: I just, I mean mug it and then I punch it in the face.
Eric: Alright, roll an intimidation.
Julia: Okay!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: [Chuckles] It’s a nat 20.
[Everyone cheering]
Eric: Everyone is rolling so well! Alright how do you intimidate the shit out of this punching bag?
Julia: I just yell at it
Julia (as Val): YOUR SISTER’S PUSH-AH!
Julia: And then just punch it in the face.
Eric: As you connect with the punching bag the two of you see it almost like in slow motion you can see that the punching bag curls around Val’s fist, it flops around like a sausage and it springs back and it just comes off of the chain.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: It flies ten feet in the other direction and then a confetti cannon that goes off and now there’s confetti all over you.
Julia (as Val): We woooon!
Julia: We won right?
Eric: As you look back you see that the three other contestants and also a dog are running at you as fast as possible.
Julia (as Val): Hey Aggie, punch that one.
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh yeah.
Julia (as Val): And I am going to punch this second one, because I do not have a lot of confidence in you, my good friend Milo.
Brandon (as Milo): That’s rude, but fair.
Julia (as Val): Okay!
Amanda: Yeah I just punch the one on the right.
Eric: How do you do it?
Amanda:I kind of look around nervously, rear my fist back and just punch it.
Eric: Okay, make an attack roll.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: So that’s a 7 + 5 for a 12.
Eric: With a 12 do you just punch it and then it comes back cause it’s a punching bag.
Amanda: I’m gonna use my bonus action to punch it again.
Eric: You’re just gonna punch it? Okay punch it!
[Dice rolls]
Julia: Better
Amanda: A 16 + 5 for a 21!
Eric: Alright with a 21, you punch it harder this time it comes back and the fanfare that happened when Val did just doesn’t happen.
Amanda: Shit.
Eric: Milo do you want a shot at this? You have one before everyone’s catching up.
Brandon: Well here’s the thing Eric, we forgot to roll my spiritual surge earlier. I ended the pass without trace spell obviously when we got here. I did roll while Julia was taking her action—
Julia: Ohh noo.
Brandon: and I was gonna just be like oh obviously it’s not gonna roll so I just rolled it just to get it out of the way, I did roll a 1.
Eric: [laughing] Alright! Yeah let’s do it! No you’re right, you’re totally right roll another d10 bud!
Julia: Brandon why?!
Amanda: Brandon, do you just get all the chaos in your life out in dnd?
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Is that what happens? Okay.
Brandon: I rolled a 4.
Eric: Alright with a 4 this time—
Brandon: There are good things on this table I promise.
Julia: At least you’re not frozen in place this time.
[Eric laughing to himself]
Julia: Oh no...
Eric: [Laughing] Alright so you suck all the shadows back up like for everyone it’s like they’re being colored back in, but again the hand in the middle of your chest stays and—
Brandon (as Milo): God — seriously? Again?
Eric: It’s like the shadows start wrapping around your hands and it wraps more and more and more, and your hands look like boxing gloves, they’re huge.
Brandon: Good, great!
Eric: So now when you punch for the next minute, you deal 1 d10 bludgeoning damage.
Amanda: How convenient!
Julia: Punch punch punch punch punch!
Brandon (as Milo): Someone’s looking out for me,alright.
Brandon: Eric will you give me shillelagh on this?
Eric: Yeah if you want to put shillelagh on it, I’ll give you the bonus to do it.
Julia: Milo’s just like
Julia (as Milo): Here’s Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk.
[Everyone laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): Here’s Bones and Spoke cause Kirk’s a dick.
Julia: Alright, fair enough.
Julia (as Val): I don’t know who those people are.
Brandon: So I’m also gonna cast as a bonus action, cast shillelagh so that means I can use my spellcasting ability instead of strength as my modifier.
Eric: Great, yeah do it!
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 21.
Eric: Alright so you definitely hit it, let’s talk about it, what’s the relationship you have to the ghost in your chest? Cause like the hand has been coming out a lot, way more than I the dungeon master thought would happen like do you really not have control over this thing?
Brandon: Well it’s multiple things right like every time I roll a spiritual surge table, some other spirit within me is just brought out and has a desire to be in the mortal plane again and expresses themselves through that power. That’s what the idea is.
Eric: Right.
Brandon: Yeah I don’t really have control to stop them right now but like we saw casting without trace, I’ve done it before so I’ve sort of know the like levers to pull to get that one out cause I’ve done it before.
Eric: Interesting. It seems like this spirit in your chest using this portal, they have to know something cause it seems pretty conditional over what has been happening and again, I’ve just been rolling it just so happens that it’s happening. So you looked down at your punching bag hands and you see that the spirit really is like this ethereal, I even think this long fingered sort of long nailed iridescent, even hand is also there. It seems like it acknowledges you when it turns over and curls its fist into a fist. So it’s like all three of you wallop, you’ve got Spock on one arm and Bones on the other arm and a ghost fist in the middle—
Amanda: Captain Kirk.
Eric: [Laughing] And all three of your hands wallop the punching bag at the same time.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: The chain holding the punching bag just dissolves into shadow and it falls over. The confetti cannon goes PEW! And you’re covered in confetti.
Brandon: Milo takes a step back and high fives the two hands together and is like
Brandon (as Milo): Alright y’all, let’s do that one again later.
Eric: You still have these massive hands, so Aggie you have one action pretty much until these people are on top of you. Sour Anthony has flown up high and is coming down like an eagle strike bomb.
Julia: He’s the worst.
Eric: Fritz is just running as fast as his incredibly professional athletic body can, and Emily now has her katana out and is running with it dragging on the floor like in an anime.
Amanda: I’m going to — listen if hands fail, you move to feet, that’s what my mom always taught me.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: I’ve heard that too.
Amanda: So I’m going to turn to the side and like side kick, like kickboxing kick the bag with my work boots on which are steel-toed by the way and very heavy.
Eric: Very good.
Amanda: And then I’ll use a ki point to use flurry of blows to make two additional unarmed strikes as my bonus action, so that is three kicks.
Julia: Doing big roundhouse kicks over and over again.
Amanda: Yeah yeah yeah!
Eric: So in steel-toed boots is badass. Okay make your rolls.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: So the first one is 21.
Eric: Okay
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: 13.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: And a 19.
Eric: Alright, yeah you connect with all three.
Amanda: YAY!
Eric: So what does this combo you’re doing of kicks with your steel-toed boots look like?
Amanda: So I think the first two I’m just balancing on my left foot and kicking with my right foot, my arms up in fists in front of me and I go one-two. Then I go back down on that leg and spin around with the other one and do like a flying kick with my left foot.
Eric: Hell yeah, you shouldn’t be using steel-toed boots on this punching bag.
Amanda: Eric, you never know when you’re gonna be on an active worksite!
Julia: That’s true.
Amanda: You need toe protections!
Julia: She gotcha there.
Eric: So you just rip a hole in the punching bag and the confetti goes off PEW! And you hear a sound effect from the speakers somewhere go [bouncy fanfare music]
Amanda (as Aggie: I thought I destroyed you!
Eric (as Emily): There’s another one, there are lots of speakers, hey I rigged the whole warehouse for speakers but [deep exhale]
Eric: Everyone’s super out of breath except for Sour Anthony who then like dive bombs and hits the ground.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [Kermit Voice] Oh hurt my head! I hurt everything!
Julia: Just deserved!
Eric (as Emily): Congratulations, you won! You won the obstacle course, I didn’t think that ready set go would get everyone to do it but here we are.
Eric: And then the dog running up, and Gordon just flops over on his dog back.
Julia: He’s just tired.
Eric: Yeah he’s tired, so yeah Emily’s leaned over in sweat, she’s sweat through the button down she wore that day and is like
Eric (as Emily): Alright yeah, great job! You’re really good at this stuff, I’m surprised. I dunno if you’ve trained or anything but hell yeah dude, sick, nice!
Amanda (as Aggie): Emily why did you have to do this? Why did you spend all this money— where did all this money come from where did this $10,000 come from?
Julia (as Val): Also what website did you buy this from cause I am very curious now.
Eric (as Emily): Honestly? American Ninja Warrior buys this stuff and they think they’re gonna be big and then two years later they don’t know what to do with it, so it’s very easy to buy off of craigslist when you know where you’re looking.
Julia (as Val): Alright.
Eric (as Emily): But you know around, that’s… Don’t worry about it. The point is that I think you three will be great when we take down The Nephews.
Julia (as Val): Oh yeah that was the thing we were doing.
Brandon (as Milo): Oh right…
Eric (as Emily): So just give me all of your, listen I’ll put us all on a text chain, you guys have each other’s phone numbers? You know what, I'm just gonna make a group.
Eric: And immediately you all get a text message that says “Crime Fighters” with an alarm emoji.
Julia (as Val): That is extremely conspicuous.
Eric (as Emily): Oh do you want it — I can change it?
Julia (as Val): Yes to something else, please.
Eric: Then it’s “Crime Fighterz” with a Z,
Julia (as Val): Nooo.
Eric: But now there’s a —
Amanda: A flower
Eric: There’s a flower
Julia (as Val): Remove Crime from the group—
Eric (as Emily): Okay fine I’ll work on it later, it’s fine! It’s great, it’s gonna be great. I’ll text y’all later. Hey other three, you other three you did such a good job but you know I might not need you now but I’ll text you. I don’t have any of your phone numbers, ooh I actually got a big blast I didn’t take down your phone numbers, they might have been deleted but I just uhh I can text you — I can find you on social. It’s cool.
Julia: I hate that.
Eric (as Emily): Uhh Gordon where do you put your phone when you’re an animal?
Eric: Gordon’s just still flopped over—
Amanda: Is someone gonna pet him? I don’t want to but someone should.
Julia: Nope.
Eric: Someone should pet this dog.
Julia: That is a man in dog form.
Amanda: True.
Julia: I am not going to pet his belly.
Eric: Gordon turns back into his tech-bro schlubby outfit that he has on.
Julia: Slightly better.
Eric (as Gordon): [With a nasally voice] Okay uh, well see ya later guys!
Eric: And Gordon just walks out with flip-flop sounds
[Everyone groans]
[Eric tries to make squeaking noises]Amanda: Before Fritz leaves I want to pass my business card and be like
Amanda (as Aggie): So this was bananas but if you ever wanna chat you know where I am look me up.
Eric (as Fritz): Yeah um, it’s embarrassing when I lose obstacle courses because I am uh… You know. I’m just a regular person, just so everyone knows.
Julia (as Val: S’ok I’m super strong so.
Brandon (as Milo): We all are! Just regular people.
Julia (as Val): Regular people, just super strong regular people.
Amanda: I give him a knowing nod.
Eric (as Fritz): Alright see ya, Aggie.
Eric: Fritz just stalks out.
Julia: I wanna know what his power is so bad, he’s the only one that didn’t reveal it.
Amanda: Me too!! I know!
Eric: Sour Anthony’s just flying around being like
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [Kermit voice] Aw well fuck you guys.
Julia (as Val): Fuck you Sour Anthony!
Amanda (as Aggie): Fuck you, Sour Anthony! You owe us some beer.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Aw fuck you guys, I can do this myself I can fly, yeah I’m like Superman! Fuck you. Except for Milo.
Julia: I just let him leave cause I don’t want him to talk anymore.
Eric: He takes his bag and he’s just snacking on his thing.
Amanda (as Aggie): What are you eating?!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey! Fuck you dude.
Eric: And he just flies out
Julia (as Val): I bet his flight is powered by snack food.
Amanda (as Aggie): That’s what I think too!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey shut the fuck up it isn’t the snacks!
Julia (as Val): See! Fuckin’ told you!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey fuck you dude! I don’t go to your place of business and tell you how to eat.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey Sour Anthony it’s time to—
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey fuck you!
Brandon (as Milo): Hey it’s time to calm down! It’s time to leave.
Julia (as Val): Someone had too many sours.
Eric: Anthony just flies off into the night. Alright now it’s just you three and Emly you now are fully out of initiative. You can go home.
Julia: I stop vibrating.
Eric: You stop vibrating, you’re out of your range. So Emily says
Eric (as Emily): So yeah, I mean that’s all kinda all I had planned for today so—
Brandon (as Milo): Emily you throw weird parties. Has anyone ever told you that?
Eric (as Emily): Weird, but also good. That’s what the mayor said when I threw the gala for the arts high school. It was all Mapplethorpe themed.
Julia (as Val): What the fuck?
[Amanda makes confused sounds]
Eric (as Emily): It was called “Inappropriate”
Brandon (as Milo): Cool… Alright, okay…
Eric (as Emily): I had a real Piss Jesus there.
Brandon (as Milo): I’m gonna leave.
Eric (as Emily): Alright, fine see you later, Milo! I’ll text you!
Amanda (as Aggie): We’re gonna talk about where, why, how, all of this is happening at some point.
Eric (as Emily): Sure yeah! Listen we’ll catch up in a few days, I gotta check out to see when the best place to hit them is. [chuckles] It’s so funny talking like that, but we’ll take care of it yeah! It’ll be great. I'll text you!
[Beat of silence]
Julia: Val leaves and changes the group chat as they leave to “Not Friends”
[Everyone laughs]
Amanda: I’ll walk out as well but saying on my way out
Amanda (as Aggie): Know that I’m only here cause I’m worried about what’s gonna happen if I’m not.
Eric (as Emily): Good enough reason for me! $10,000 and ten thousand files in pride. Best I can come up with.
Julia (as Val): I am here for the $10,000 just in case anyone has any questions or has any doubts.
Brandon: Milo turns around on his heels real quick and jogs up to Emily
Brandon (as Milo): Emily one more thing, um you are, you’re Sergeant Slaughter on eBay correct?
Eric (as Emily): SergentSlaughter1991! That’s my handle.
Brandon (as Milo): I’ll trade you this lunch box for that key you bought if you are interested.
Eric (as Emily): Uhh… What? Key? What key? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Brandon (as Milo): The old weird key, it’s a limited edition, it’s worth — it’s like four or five hundred lunchbox. C’mon we’re friends now I need the key, trades?
Eric (as Emily): Hmmm… Oh you mean this key?
Eric: She picks up her purse and rummages through it and picks out this big ornate pewter key that’s supposed to go into the emergency slot on Dr. Morrow’s science experiments.
Eric (as Emily): Oh you mean this one?
Brandon (as Milo): Yes!
Eric (as Emily): Oh! No. Also that lunch box? Is a fake… You can tell because if you look really close Monty has three antenna. It’s worth $50 at most.
Brandon: Milo feels some magic surge through him and he’s going to cast charm person.
Eric: [laughing] How many spell slots do you have?
Brandon: A lot!
Eric: So what do I do?
Brandon: You make a wisdom saving throw.
Eric: Okay what am I trying to beat?
Brandon: 13.
[Dice rolling]
Eric: Okay, what does charm person look like?
Brandon: I think this one’s energy is radiating from the top and the bottom of its body and a coalescence in the center but then shoots out the shadow of a person in aura form and sort of just envelops Emily.
Eric: Yeah that’s really cool it’s like the shadow version will listen to you and do whatever you want. So the shadow starts walking up towards Emily from behind and it’s like she turns back and sees it and waves her hand at it like she’s dispelling smoke and just goes
Eric (as Emily): Did you do that?! Can you not send your shadow monsters because you want this key?
Brandon (as Milo): Have we not talked about how I cannot do any of this I don’t do any of it.
Eric (as Emily): Okay but well, how about instead because I know you tried to do that, that was weird, how about instead I’ll give you the key but you don’t get $10,000.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay, that’s fine.
Eric (as Emily): Alright, cool. Saves me some money.
Eric: And she hands you the key.
Brandon: Sweet,
Eric: There you go.
Brandon: I put it in my pocket.
Eric: Wonderful.
Brandon: How big is the key?
Eric: It’s like oversized, it’s pretty big like it’s definitely heavy and it’s sticking out of your pocket.
Brandon (as Milo): C’mon, Tuna.
Eric (as Tuna): Mmm I was here the whole time helping.
[Amanda laughing]
Eric: So yeah so Aggie, Val, you’re standing out in the parking lot, are you waiting for Milo?
Julia: I think Val just keeps changing the group text name.
Brandon: Milo has muted this chat by the way.
Julia: Yes. Smart smart.
Eric: It’s muted already?
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Aggie’s turned her phone off.
[Brandon and Eric laugh]
Eric: Alright so yay, you guys are hanging in the parking lot outside of the warehouse I want you both to make perception checks with disadvantage.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Alright it’s a 2 for me.
Amanda: A 7.
Julia: We don’t see anything ever.
Amanda: No!
Eric: So you’re waiting for Milo, you’re both messing around with your phones, not really paying attention, you’re more trying to dunk on Emily in the group chat. You look up and you see there are headlights coming very fast toward both of you.
Amanda: I sort of instinctively put an arm out to try to move Val back with me like against a car.
Eric: I want you both to make dexterity saving throws.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: Good luck, fam.
Amanda: I got a 9.
Julia: 13.
Eric: I want you both to take 16 points of damage.
[Amanda and Julia groaning]
Eric: As this car which is charging at you, as you try to get out of the way, it still hits both of you as you bounce off of it.
Amanda: Oh my.
Eric: And it quickly peels out, you see this thing is bigger than a car and it’s hard for it to get out of the way. This is an ice cream truck and it is speeding out of the way.
Julia: Is it a Ma’s Ice Cream truck?
Eric: Make a perception check.
Julia: It’s a 5, I’m gonna use my charger so when I use charger I use my action to dash and as a bonus action I make a melee attack or I shove the thing so what I’d like to do is as it’s turning kind of like it’s probably on its axis as it tries to turn I wanna try to shove it and push it over
[Eric laughing]
Brandon: That is the coolest fuckin’ thing I’ve ever heard.
Eric: Aww jesus christ, okay.
Amanda: I would like to join them as well, I’ll use another ki point to double my speed to dash as a bonus action and try to push it over as well.
Eric: So you both are going to make athletics checks, and I am going to make a strength check for a truck.
[Amanda and Julia laughing]
Eric: Let me look up what this could be. I’m gonna say an ice cream truck has +5 to being pushed over.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: Alright I got an 8 on my first roll, I’m gonna use a luck point and reroll that.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: On my reroll I got a 15 total.
Eric: Val what’d you get?
Julia: A 9.
Eric: I was gonna give you a weighted average because you two were gonna do it together, but unfortunately I rolled a 23 for the ice cream truck, and you did really poorly on your perception check too right? Yeah you don’t see any sort of markings on this ice cream truck, it’s dark, you’re in the middle of the warehouse district. The ice cream truck just peels out and bolted down the street.
Amanda: Would you say we dented it even though we didn’t push it over?
Eric: You know, that is a good question.
Amanda: Val also has a lot of rings on so maybe they scratched paint?
Julia: Oh I got the brass knuckles on.
Eric: Okay, I like that I think that you did pretty well. I would say that Val you got some ice cream truck paint on your brass knuckles.
Julia: Cool.
Amanda: So hopefully we can identify the ice cream truck out and about in the city tomorrow.
Eric: Yeah it’s just all which unfortunately. You didn’t get any sort of details on it but your brass knuckles are covered in white paint.
Brandon: It’s a real Cinderella situation tomorrow.
[Eric laughing]
Brandon: Val is just like “nope! Nope!”
Amanda: Punching trucks all over town.
Eric: I want you two, Val and Aggie, to make perception checks.
[Dice rolls]
Julia: [Groans] 3.
Amanda: 21
Eric: Val you’re trying to tend to your brass knuckles, Aggie as you jump out in the street to try to figure out where the ice cream truck is going as fast as possible, maybe faster than an ice cream truck probably should. Down the street a motorcycle pulls up behind it and you see the glint of a street light on a mirror as both the motorcycle and the ice cream truck take a hard left about ten blocks down the street.
Amanda: Do I get the sense that the Knight of Mirrors is chasing them or aiding and abetting?
Eric: Chasing, definitely chasing.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: Yeah, Milo as you come out of the warehouse you hear this whole giant commotion.
Brandon: I jog up to Val and Aggie
Brandon (as Milo): Are y’all okay?
Julia (as Val): We were just walking here and this truck hit us.
Brandon: I help them up.
Amanda: I lay a hand on Val and cast healing hands on each of us.
Eric: Okay wonderful, so roll on those.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: So Val gets 12 hit points back, and I get 7.
Julia: Oh hell yeah.
Eric: Nice, wonderful, good heals. So as you pull yourself up from the ground Milo is just jogging out and you hear Emily from behind you saying
Eric (as Emily): What’d I tell you? Streets are dangerous.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party…
Eric: Goons storm the charity auction at First National Bank of Lake Town City. Y’know they’ve hit a few banks a few times, this should all go according to plan, right? Uhh, not so much. Val straight up tackles a guy, Aggie runs down the criminal hitting the vault, and Milo uses his ghost magic to nab ‘em. Other than that nothing that strange happened… Well someone riding on a chromatic reflective motorcycle rode into the bank and called themselves the Knight of Mirrors and Tuna turned into a panther and ran around the city. But it’s just another ordinary evening in the LTC, I’m sure the next day will be just as normal. Let’s get the party started.
[theme music]
Eric: So this is day two in Lake Town City, welcome!
Amanda [singing]: Lake Town City!
Julia [also singing]: Lake Town City!
Eric: Where all your dreams come true!
Brandon: Bah bah bah bah bah!
Eric: ‘Cause of science!
Amanda: Listen, we make the show for artistic fulfillment, but also if there’s not an animatic of the trailer educational video for Lake Town City, I’m going to cry.
Eric: It doesn’t even need to be, like, drawn, it could just be a recorded screen of someone doing a powerpoint, I’m fine with that.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Absolutely fine to me!
Amanda: With the occasional pointing.
Eric: All you need is a capture card and a power point. That’s all you need. This is great, alright! Uh after the auction what do you all do? Cause Val got the suitcase off of their hand, and Aggie I guess got the shit kicked out of her a little bit. Amanda: Yeah, I’ve got four hit points left y’all. So I’m gonna go straight home, pet Sushi and have a lil’ cheese and go to bed.
Eric: Fair. Brandon: Does Aggie feel weird eating sushi now?
Amanda: No.
Julia and Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: It has never occurred to her.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Does Milo feel weird eating tuna?
Brandon: Milo has never liked tuna, when he was a kid there was a lot of tuna casserole involved— Julia: Not even like a filet of tuna or like a tuna roll? Brandon: Uhh, he’s not a big sushi person but maybe if he goes to a fancy place and gets like a tuna steak, y’know?
Amanda: When Tuna’s really pissing you off you could be like “you know, I know what I’m having for dinner.”
Brandon: [laughing] Stare them in the eyes as he eats some out of the can.
Julia (as Milo): We’re BOTH suffering here.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: Well, this could be a time because Tuna turned into a panther. So what’s Milo doing?
Julia: Hey whaddup with that?
Brandon: I mean, Milo’s gonna run after Tuna for a little bit. He knows that after a little while Tuna gets tired and disapperates, essentially, but for the time being he’s gonna run after Tuna and make sure that Tuna doesn’t destroy anything too valuable.
Eric: Okay, just make a flat dexterity roll for tracking.
[Dice roll]
Brandon: 12!
Amanda: Ooo!
Eric: I think with a 12, you can follow Tuna around, Tuna the panther, and there’s some mischief happening, I think if you had an angry panther running around a city for an hour, just like knocking shit over, and people are very confused. I think with a 12 though you can’t really do anything about it, you can follow but you can’t stop them.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I think that people are taking video of the panther, like there is a literal panther running around and it happens for an hour and it’s wild, and then as soon as you see Tuna the panther is on top of a pretzel cart, eating all the pretzels in there, and then poof! Disappears.
Brandon: The video headlines are like “Panther Goes to the Highest Spots in City? And Knocks Things Over. Weird.”
Eric: [laughing] “Panther Growls at Hotel Staff as it Runs to Penthouse at the Lake Town City Grand.” Amanda: If any of the flower beds in the museum are disrupted I am going to be pissed.
Eric: Nah, I think just general mischief, uh, but yeah people definitely see the panther and video tape it and stuff. Julia: Does Lake Town City have a zoo?
Eric: Probably, I think that some people assume that the panther is from the zoo, it’s like the Average Bear headline is like “Panther Escapes from Zoo, Zookeepers say Not Ours!” [Everyone laughing]
Brandon: Zookeepers say “shrug emoji”
Eric: [laughing] Zookeepers shrug emoji? So no one knows where the panther came from which is strange.
Julia: Then it just becomes an exposé on exotic pets.
Eric: Yeah, yeah! It’s like everyone just throwing shit on the wall, there’s a bunch of memes of the panther.
Amanda: There’s a definite, like, obligatory mention to the potential giant mountain lobster in the lake.
Eric: “I can has pretzel?” it’s Tuna on top of the cart.
Brandon: This is like the moment in history where average bear society, whether or not to be hard journalism—
Eric: Well no, there’s average bear and then there’s Average Bear Reports which is where Tegan, keep up. Tegan has a different job. Alright so—
Julia: Tegan’s a professional, god dammit! Eric: Tegan went to j-school, they worked at the Washington Post for a while and now they’re at Average Bear Reports. Alright so you all go to bed and that is gonna be your long rest so you all get your hit points and stuff back!
Everyone: Yay!
Brandon: Oh I get my spell slots!
Amanda: I get my luck points, and my key points.
Eric: You have so many points. Julia: I can just rage more.
Eric and Julia: Scree!
Eric: Alright, let’s start with Val. So Val, it’s Friday, so you might have a different job or you might just be running errands today, but uh what are you, what do you do? Julia: It’s dog walking.
Eric: Ahh it’s dog walking. Amanda: Yay!
Eric: So we have [laughs] we have a montage of you walking like twelve dogs at the same time, very good. Julia: There’s one bernese mountain dog that is pretty much as big as me.
Amanda: Oh yeah.
Brandon: Does Val get in an argument with any dog?
Julia: [laughing] Sometimes! Sometimes the dogs don’t move and they have to be like Julia (as Val): Ay Bruiser! Let’s get it goin’, c’mon! We have to get Charlotte back to her parent’s house in like twenty minutes! Brandon (as Val): We talked about this!
Julia (as Val): [laughing] We talked about this! Eric: Bruiser we talked— [starts laughing] so Val do you wanna use one rage at the dog park? Asking so I can keep notes.
Julia: There are dogs picking on one of the smaller dogs, like one of the new puppies that hasn’t been acclimated to the pack yet, and Val picks them up and just like in their shitty raggedy sweatshirt just like zips the dog up, like baby bjorns them.
Brandon and Amanda: Awww!
Amanda: Extremely good. Julia (as Val): S’ok Moxie they’ll, they’ll learn to love you.
Eric: You get a text from Dom Five. Eric (as Dom Five): Uhhh hey, uh, come on over. When you get a chance.
Julia (as Val): I can stop by later, can I get some of your mom’s cheesecake?
Eric (as Dom Five): What? Okay. Eric: Finger pinch emoji. Julia: Three finger pinch emojis back. Eric: Um so, you finish up with the dogs and you head over to Dominic’s and Dom is back in his office. Julia: I walk in.
Eric (as Dom Five): Oh uhh we gotta celebrity here! Oh it’s so good to see you! Wow can I get an autograph? Should I take a photo with you and put you up on the wall? Cause I — you and Al Pachino would look really good together side by side, I think.
Julia (as Val): Yes we would! What are you talking about?
Eric (as Dom Five): Oh well, so you haven’t been… I guess, I didn’t know I guess I’m so cool with the social media now— Julia (as Val): I woke up two hours ago, I walked some dogs, and I came here.
[Everyone laughs]
Eric: Dom takes out his phone and pokes on it a little bit and shows you a video of you kicking the shit outta these goons.
Amanda: Yas Val!
Eric: There is also the part where you’re vibrating so.
Julia: It looks out of focus.
Eric: Yes, it definitely looks weird to the human eye especially recorded on a phone. Eric (as Dom Five): Uhh I didn’t know you could fight like that. Maybe I should uhh, I got, we got other stuff for you to do. I could always use more people for—
Julia (as Val): Well first off, I don’t advertise that y’know, we’re going around fighting people all the time.
Eric (as Dom Five): I mean, I do all the time. Julia (as Val): How do you own a business?!
Eric (as Dom Five): I’m… I’m uhhh part of this community and uh people respect me for it.
Julia (as Val): Oh sure, sure.
Eric (as Dom Five): Val, cool, uh would you like to do that professionally?
Julia (as Val): Like boxing?
Eric (as Dom Five very high pitched): I uh I mean if you don’t wanna that’s fine! Julia (as Val): I like walking dogs, I like making pizza, I like sometimes yelling at your customers to know how to order pizza, I like making deliveries.
Brandon: I like feeding pizza to dogs.
Julia (as Val): I like feeding pizza to dogs! Whenever you throw out pizza, I feed it to the dogs. It’s probably not good for them but they love it.
Eric (as Dom Five): Okay! Alright well uh, I’m gonna keep ya in mind, just so you know! Julia (as Val): Keep me in mind for what? Eric (as Dom Five): Okay, uh did the thing happen uh uh alright?
Julia (as Val): Did you get a chair delivered to your house or what?
Eric (as Dom Five): Yes but I wanted to ask you first, oh sorry do you want me to brag and bring up the receipt for you? Julia (as Val): Yes please!
Eric (as Dom Five): You wanna look at my email? You both a champion boxer and you also hack into the mainframe? You’re the brains and the brawn apparently, I dunno where I fit in anymore.
Julia (as Val): I dunno, I haven’t won any titles yet or anything.
Eric (as Dom Five): Oh man, I love you like a child but fuck, go fuck yourself! Truly fuck yourself! I cannot believe…
Julia (as Val): Go fuck yourself! Is this what you wanted cause—
Eric (as Dom Five): Yeah that’s literally all I wanted! Hey! What was with the panther?
Julia (as Val): [laughing] I don’t fuckin’ know!
Eric (as Dom Five: Oh okay, I just figured I would ask. Julia (as Val): Okay, I’m gonna grab some lasagna and some cheesecake, I’ll see ya later!
Eric (as Dom Five): Alright see ya later. Julia (as Val): Not paying for ‘em!
Eric (as Dom Five): Never do.
Eric: And you go over and you’re spooning lasagne into a tupperware that you have. Julia: Yup! Absolutely and I bring it upstairs.
Eric: Yes, absolutely and you get a text message from a number that you don’t recognize, and it says. Eric (with a slightly higher voice): Oh my god Val! Hey! This is Emily, Emily Slaughter it’s so nice— I saw you in the video!
Julia (as Val): Who in the fuck are you? [Everyone laughs]
Brandon: Finger pinch emoji.
Eric: Finger pinch emoji, um so Julia this is what I want to ask you: how long did Val live in Lake Town City?
Julia: So Val’s dad bought the cabin in Lake Town City as a wedding present. Eric: Like back in the early 80’s?
Julia: In the early 80’s before the incident, and Val’s mom would go up there just to like get away from it all, or sometimes it was a little hot so you didn’t want to be around the city cause y’know the feds come knockin’ on your door you don’t want— Amanda: Took a long drive.
Julia: Yeah you just wanna take a long drive.
Eric: It’s like hey why don’t you uhh go up to Lake Town just for a week or so? It’s fine! Amanda: Gets you outta the house!
Julia: And so when the incident happened that’s when Val’s parents separated mostly because of the quarentine and stuff, but they were kinda like on again off again because no one ever really gets fuckin’ divorced in the Catholic church. Um and so Val was kinda born as a result but lived full-time with their mom but spent summers down in New York City with their dad.
Eric: Okay. Julia: Until they were like sixteen or seventeen probably.
Eric: Okay so how do you think Val associated with the other people who were living in the historic Lake Town District?
Julia: Not great, I picture. I feel like they were always the outsider cause their mom was not a Lake Town City original, necessarily. Or not Lake Town Original, she was only up there every once and a while and the fact that she happened to be there for the incident was a surprise to everyone. Eric: Coincidental, really.
Julia: Very coincidental! For sure, so I think either was distanced or distanced themselves from most of the Lake Town City proper people.
Eric: Okay, alright, so with Emily texting you.
Eric (as Emily): Oh no, it’s Emilyl, we grew up, well we were kind of neighbors. I saw you in the video from the auction and I just had to reach out. It’s wild what happened to you.
Julia (as Val): Yeah. I-I mean there were other people there too, it wasn’t just me.
Eric (as Emily): No I know, I recognized your face and your cool hair so cool hello!
Julia (as Val): Thank you.
Eric (as Emily): It’s good to see you again! Julia (as Val): My hair is cool, thank you.
Eric (as Emily): You know what? Tonight I’m actually having a group of people together, all these people who grew up in the original Lake Town, and from there, you should come by! It’s gonna be really fun seeing all these people again, there’s gonna be free beer, some snacks, um it’s kinda like, I have this friend who has this warehouse space on the boarder of Industry City and Thornhill, it’ll be really fun! You should come by.
Julia (as Val): There any bands playing?
Eric (as Emily): There can- uhh, yeah! Yes! Your favorite band is going to be there.
Julia (as Val): Grift Store?
Eric (as Emily): Yes absolutely! I love them, Johnny Crash too is like wow! Julia (as Val): Okay, um you know what I’ll see if I can swing by. Eric (as Emily): Yeah? I would really like to see you, just to catch up and have us all catch up together, it’ll be sick. Julia (as Val): Mmmalright maybe.
Eric (as Emily): Okay, and hey 9:00 P.M.
Eric: And she sends you a dropped pin with the address.
Julia: I don’t respond. [Laughing] playing it cool!
Eric: Alright, let’s check in with Aggie! Aggie, you have your meeting with Tegan today.
Amanda: I mean it’s not so much a meeting it’s more like I told them where I’m gonna be, if they wanna stop by that’s cool, but if they don’t show up I’ll only be quietly disappointed instead of fully disappointed.
Eric: Instead of out loud disappointed. Where did you tell Tegan you wanted to meet?
Amanda: I didn’t, I just said I’d be on shift all day at the museum. But luckily, no middle schoolers to talk to today so Aggie wakes up as normal, pudders around, waters the plants, feeds Sushi. Then when she’s all dressed and ready to face the day her normal uniform makes her feel really you know, confident, and this is the armor she puts on to face the day. Goes out to the Mountain News to pick up her paper and coffee and roll as always. Eric: Alright you go over there and Mickie has all of it in a paper bag. Eric (as Mickie): Alright here’s the order, I don’t wanna mess with you today.
Amanda (as Aggie): Big night for news huh?
Eric (as Mickie): Yeah, uh, I learned a lot about my city, and crime, cats, large jungle cats. Uh I also you know something that I didn’t learn was the years of krav maga apparently that you know how to do.
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh what?
Eric (as Mickie): Oh are we just gonna skate by on that? You kicking the shit outta some goons, pretty cool! You know, I thought you were a boring person, and then I thought you were cool, but then you’re owning your boringness so now there’s like a level of boring, and a level of cool, and then another level of boring? But below that a very deep well like an oil spring of cool.
[Brandon laughing] Amanda (as Aggie): [almost hesitantly] Thank you, Mickie uh.
Brandon: That was the story of a small Texas town in west Texas.
Amanda: It’s almost like I’m a double decker opened-faced sandwich of boring on cool toast. Is that what I’m getting out of this or…?
Eric: Yeah it’s like a parfait of cool and boring layered, but the bottom layer is just this well of hot fudge of cool.
Brandon: Julia should we take a break while they figure this out?
Julia: I am so hungry now.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know it’s not so much of that, it you know — growing up, lots of siblings I had to make sure they weren’t roughed up too much at school so uh, it’s just something I don’t know something I like to do you know. I like to stay in shape and it’s is what it is!
Eric (as Mickie): Alright, uh I’m going to sign up for the krav maga capoeira tae kwon do lessons from you I’ll exchange for bagels, great I’m glad that we have it locked down. I’ll see you tomorrow at 5:00 A.M. I’ll have a gi on.
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): You know me, I just wanna try to keep everybody safe and happy and calm. If someone comes in with a mask on trying to rob a bank and I’m the only one around, I’m gonna do what I have to do.
Eric (as Mickie): Apparently. Oh you know I added something else to your order.
Eric: Mickie points over to the few chairs within the Mountain News and Tegan is sitting there with their—
Amanda (as Aggie): JESUS.
[Julia laughing]
Eric (as Tegan): It’s not my fault you didn’t notice me. Cause [laughs] I’m also wearing, as I’ve said before, my statement piece: turquoise jacket.
Brandon: Do they wear this jacket everyday?
Eric: All the time. Perpetually.
Julia: How bad does it smell? Eric: It — you think they don’t take care of it? Julia: I’m just wondering! Eric: Tegan Murphy of Average Bear News.
Amanda: I think Tegan probably always smells of sandalwood or some shit.
Julia: Are they just a fanfic character? Or?
Eric: Listen, that’s not canon! That’s Amanda’s headcanon of Tegan.
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh, hop in the truck if you wanna see what I do everyday, come see my morning rounds.
Eric (as Tegan): Okay! Sounds fun.
Eric: Tegan hops in the truck, at first Tegan hops in the bed and is like Eric (as Tegan): Is this wrong? Is this not what I’m supposed to do? I don’t know anything about working about anything. Amanda: Aggies sits in the driver’s seat and just shakes her head slowly.
Brandon: Are they trying to seem relatable and down home?
Eric: [without skipping a beat] Yeah! Hundred percent!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: So they hop in the cab and Tegan takes out a recorder. Eric (as Tegan): You know, I am trying to write an article about you, can I record this?
Amanda (as Aggie): Again, anything… Um… Amanda: And Aggie looks down at the recorder.
Amanda (as Aggie): Um…
Eric (as Tegan): It’s not on yet.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh! Uh I mean do I have to say off the record or how does this work?
Eric (as Tegan): No I was just gonna ask you before I could turn it on, is this okay? I’m writing about you, I’m not writing about the institution. I think that you’re interesting.
Amanda (as Aggie): I just - listen I’m just, I’m—I’m uncomfortable with that, I live in a small town, have a small job, and I’m the least famous of my siblings by far, and I kind of like it that way to be honest.
Eric (as Tegan): It’s cool listen, it’s one article. Please? Amanda (as Aggie): But isn’t it a whole just viral, and it’s on the internet, and then everyone gets it to their phone.
Brandon: Has Aggie used the internet before?
Julia: It’s like a TikTok I hear?
Amanda: Aggie’s great with a beeper.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric (as Tegan): Kind of, I guess? Listen, you know if you don’t give me anything interesting, I won’t write about it. But you gotta let me give it a shot. Pleaase? This is my reporter trick. Pleaaaase?
[Brandon laughing] Julia: So professional!
Eric (as Tegan): Pleaaase? Amanda: Aggie smiles despite herself.
Amanda (as Aggie): I-I see what you’re doing.
Eric (as Tegan): Okay, so I’m gonna start recording and the recorder is now on.
Amanda (as Aggie): So um… This is uh Lake Town. You might know that uh Lake Town City, before it was this big uh destination before Dr. Morrow, and the Morrow Corp diaphorum and all that, uh it’s just a little lake town where people come and live all year ‘round and then in the summer, people come up and the whole tourist economy. So this is what I do I’m a caretaker of Original Lake Town. There’s this museum down here where kinda Main Street and the lake meet and Main Street is now a historic district as well so there’s all kinds of fascinating protections I can tell you all about with the facades and the look of the thing and the old businesses and all that. Umm and I live on a cottage on the property of the museum, and every morning I just make a round around the lake and make sure everything’s alright. There was a panther incident last night as you may have seen, so just wanna make sure there was no damage or panther… poop or… you know. Or whatever else. Pretty boring.
Eric (as Tegan): [laughing] This is great stuff. This is so good. I’m sorry you’re so riveting I’m going to write about all of this, this is gonna be awesome. So do you like your—
Amanda (as Aggie): So I’m gonna have to fix a toilet later, so if you wanna come figure that out—
Eric (as Tegan): No it’s gonna be great, um so do you like doing this?
Amanda (as Aggie): It’s very fulfilling, I want to be of service and it’s great to help make sure that the folks that grew up with are being taken care of, even those who don’t have family around. Eric (as Tegan): Oh! Okay, um, you know it’s funny everything you’re talking about is Lake Town, Historic Lake Town District. To the outside it looks like this preserved place and that’s the thing, it’s like everything stays the way it is. But there is another thing that I’ve noticed that kind of connects everyone. You notice that everyone looks super good for their age?
Amanda (as Aggie): Uhh, what do you mean?
Eric (as Tegan): Oh, you know I’ve just been going around and talking to people, like the Ropers, you know the Ropers, so sweet.
Amanda (as Aggie): Ahh with the toilet you must have heard. Eric (as Tegan): Oh believe me, they told me all about it. Yeah but like they’re like in their eighties! But they don’t look a day over fifty-five. Amanda (as Aggie): I think it’s something with that mountain air, you know. It’s uh it’s just a balanced lifestyle, good diet, go out on your constitutionals, and do your brisk walks, and it’s something people really like! Eric (as Tegan): You know even your parents look amazing too. Like no older than thirty-five. I’ve seen them, I looked up some old newspapers and they look amazing, they look the same way they did in ‘85.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sorry… Did you like… Research me?
Eric (as Tegan): Yeah, oh yeah. I’m a reporter, it’s kinda the stuff that I do, but yeah!
Amanda: Aggie pulls the truck over.
Amanda (as Aggie): No, I mean how-how did you hear about me what are you trying to get out of this?
Eric (as Tegan): Nothing! It’s an interesting place, I just wanna know, must be the mountain air why everyone looks so good and why all of their children are so cool and successful. Including you!
Eric: If you wanna know more, make an insight check.
Julia: Amanda, at the same time can you also do an investigation check? A smell investigation check to see what they smell like.
Amanda: That was an 18 insight.
[Dice rolls]
Amanda: And a 9 investigation.
Eric: [laughing] Okay, 9 investigation: it could be sandalwood? I don’t even know where you, I dunno I’m not that good at it. What do you wanna know about what they’re thinking, just ask me a question and I’ll answer it.
Amanda: Does Tegan know the truth about the incident?
Eric: With an 18 you can tell that with these probing questions, they’re doing the thing where they want you to say the the sentence confirming suspicions. So with an 18 I’d say that they are leading questions to suggest that they might know what they’re talking about, but they are also being very coy.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know, Tegan, all I know is I was very fortunate to grow up in a place like this. My siblings are very fortunate to have found stuff that they’re good at that makes them proud. Lots of Olympic athletes, by the way, come from this town, lots of famous artists, there are a ton of people who have gone onto academic careers from Lake Placid and Saranac, and Keene, and Burlington. All over the map, but I’ve found something I’m good at that makes me happy, and that is you know, making sure the folks from my hometown and the buildings and the history is preserved.
Eric (as Tegan): Alright, good answer. I guess this is my stop, I’ll be in town for another few days. Let me know if you want to hang out.
Amanda (as Aggie): Again I’m in contact with the museum, the historical board, city government, lot of good facts they can give you. I’m just a groundskeeper.
Eric (as Tegan): Alright.
Eric: Tegan grabs the recorder, turns it off and opens up the door of the truck and says
Eric (as Tegan): Also you kick ass, I knew that. Amanda (as Aggie): Did the Ropers speak that highly of my plumbing skills? Because to be honest with you they just want company, there was nothing wrong with the toilet.
Eric (as Tegan): Aggie, uh recorder’s off, it’s cool.
Eric: Teagan hops out and walks away. Your beeper immediately blows up and it’s coming from Emily Slaughter. The Slaughters were a family who was also living in Lake Town at the time so you recognize the name even if you haven’t seen her in like years ever since you two graduated from NCSS, you haven’t seen her since graduation. So you got a text. It says
Eric (as Emily): Aggie! It’s Emily Slaughter, what’s up? I saw you on the news!
Amanda: Aggie stares at it for a moment and makes sure in her head which one of the Slaughter siblings Emily is, and then replies
Amanda (as Aggie): oh! great to hear from you, are you back in town? Eric (as Emily): Yeah, I moved back a little while ago. I really wanted to get all the kids from the neighborhood back together so I’m having a Historic Lake Town meet up later tonight. 9:00 P.M. if you want to come! As someone who’s still here, I think it’d be great to pull everybody together. Amanda (as Aggie): oh were you trying to book the museum? because those requests have to go through the website, we could definitely do something but maybe not with such short notice.
Eric (as Emily): Lol, computer emoji, um, no I actually have a spot my friend has a band over here and knows like a warehouse space over like where Industry City and Thornhill meet. We’re gonna meet over there, free food, some beer, I think it’d be cool just for everyone to hang out again.
Amanda: Aggie deliberately types out
Amanda (as Aggie): neat. Amanda: Period. [Julia chuckles]
Amanda (as Aggie): i’ll try to make it.
Eric (as Emily): I hope to see you!!!!!
Amanda (as Aggie): should i bring anything?
Eric (as Emily): Just yourself! And any of your friends who you know are still around from the neighborhood.
Amanda (as Aggie): thank you for including me. Eric (as Emily): Finger guns emoji.
Brandon: Does Aggie type in perfect punctuation? Julia: [whispering] Of course.
Eric: You know it!
Amanda: I can’t decide, I think it’s full punctuation, with all lowercase.
Eric: Nice!
Julia: Bold choice, and I appreciate it.
Eric: Let’s cut over to Milo! What up Milo?
Brandon: What up!
Eric: Well you had an adventurous day before!
Brandon: Very late night.
Amanda: Hey Milo why do you talk to ghosts bud?
Julia: Hey Milo what the fuck?
[Everyone laughing]
Brandon: Is that weird y’all?
Eric: Apparently, uh so, you have a to-do list today, don’t you?
Brandon: I do. Eric: So you still have the $500 in a manilla envelope that Mr. Brewpot gave you, what do you wanna do?
Brandon: Well, uh, Milo’s morning starts with his Darth Vader alarm clock going off, playing the Imperial March.
Eric: Of course. Brandon: As it does every morning, because mornings are evil.
Julia: Checks out.
Brandon: And slams it down, and realizes that once again he has fifteen minutes to get to work!
Eric: [laughing] Of course.
Brandon: So Milo decides to skip the shower, and gets ready, and just tries to hoof it over to the museum.
Eric: You take the express gondola.
Brandon: Mhm.
Amanda and Eric: Sky tram! Eric: Alright so you walk into the museum then the first thing you see is Mr. Brewpot like speed walking towards you. Brandon: I speed walk back and I say
Brandon (as Milo): Hello Mr. Brewpot, good morning, how are you doing welcome, have you had coffee, did you see there’s pastries in the employee break room? Here’s your envelope full of cash, I didn’t get the papers no one got the papers, no one got anything last night. But I will go back if there’s another auction in the meantime, I have a tour in like five minutes, is there anything I can do for you? If not, I’m gonna leave!
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Milo, uh, are-are you okay?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah! What do you mean?
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): What do — I know I’m a dad, but I’m not that unplugged from the news, are you okay? There was a panther! Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, there was a panther for everyone in the city, what are you talking about? Why would it impact me?
Eric: Okay I’m gonna get you to make a deception check to dupe this nice man who cares about you.
Amanda: Brewsky’s dad.
Julia: [laughing] There’s a panther for everyone in the city!
Brandon: Um, 11 - 1 for a 10.
Amanda: Ohh.
Julia: Oh god, bud.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Listen, Milo, if you don’t wanna talk about it, it’s fine, I don’t care about the money. Are you okay?
Brandon (as Milo): Talk about what?
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Uh, the bank robbers and the panther where you were!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, they came in and I booked it out of there! I didn’t stick around. Amanda: I’m just really glad I’m not the nervous talker in this campaign anymore.
[Everyone laughing]
Brandon: It’s a managing up strategy.
Amanda: Oh yeah, it is.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Listen Milo, uh, I’m glad you’re safe but what… Are you okay?
Brandon (as Milo): Again, yes. I didn’t get much sleep last night because I was a little wound up after a bank robbery happened at the auction I was at but, I’m fine. I’m gonna get some coffee.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Okay…
Brandon (as Milo): I’m sorry for disappointing my manager for not getting the thing they wanted.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Alright, have a good day son.
Brandon (as Milo): Here’s your tie back.
Eric (as Mr. Brewpot): Thank you.
Eric: Mr. Brewpot walks away with a very confused look on his face, and he goes back to his office. Julia: This poor man.
Eric: So what’s the plan?
Brandon: I’m gonna start by going around my morning rounds and just like flipping on light switches, turning on exhibits and go over to the sarcophagus thing, and have a lil light chat you know.
Amanda: They’re sleeping off their big night.
Brandon: I don’t know, we’ll see.
Eric: I was gonna say, yeah! You haven’t seen Tuna like you assumed that Tuna was messing with your alarm clock but you just set it incorrectly this morning.
Brandon: I mean, they’re a cat you know, they do what they want. They go their own way, they come back, who cares.
Eric: Especially a ghost cat!
Brandon: Also it’s Tuna, who cares about Tuna you know.
Amanda: I care about Tuna!!!
Eric: The audience cares about Tuna!!
Amanda: Tuna’s my favorite PC!
Brandon: Here’s the secret, Tuna’s a real dick.
Eric: It’s not a secret, bud! Alright you go over to the weird science experiment and—
Brandon: Yeah I kinda lean up against the glass enclosure with a cup of coffee in my hand, and real chill just like fiddle with a light switch and I’m like
Brandon (as Milo): Well you know, I couldn’t find the key. Is there any other way to get you outta there, uhh Mr. Ghost Friend? Oh sorry, how was your night, good morning, how are you?
Eric (as voice): It was baaad, cause I’m sitting here and I can look at my own skeleton, that’s a bummer.
Amanda: Oh no…
Brandon (as Milo): Hey what was the last thing you remember?
Eric (as voice): Um…
Eric: I do want to make you roll on this, if you want to try to endear yourself to the spirit a little more, I’ll give you advantage, but I think you need to make a persuasion check for them to talk to you.
Brandon: Okay. [Dice rolls]
Brandon: That’s a 3!
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: 14!
Eric: Okay, I will let you get the 14, you gotta endear yourself more to the spirit.
Brandon (as Milo): You’re look so radiant this morning!
Amanda: [laughing]
Brandon (as Milo): Can I tell you, I’ve never seen a better looking ghost.
Eric (as voice): What?! Uh, can you see—
Brandon (as Milo): I’ve never seen a ghost
Eric (as voice): You can see in here?!
Amanda: Roll again with disadvantage!
Brandon (as Milo): [Laughing] Um, okay no, I was bullshitting you but you sound wonderful, I’m really looking forward to becoming a friend—
Eric (as voice): So you didn’t get the key…
Brandon (as Milo): … a confidant, I did not! No one got anything from the auction it was attacked by weird masked robbers, is there another way to get you out? Was not my fault, I didn’t want to not get the key.
Eric (as voice): And where is this? Where am I?
Brandon (as Milo): Well, you’re in the MMFFC.
Eric (as voice): Uh okay, um.
Brandon (as Milo): Which is the science museum, you know?
Eric (as voice): Are there no emergency keys buried in your archives or you don’t know any other way to get your hands on them like someone must be selling one of these, everyone had one.
Brandon (as Milo): Ohh! Okay, yeah I didn’t know if it was a specific key or if it was like a replica key basically.
Eric (as voice): Yeah every employee of Dr. Morrow had one to make sure to shut down the science if the science went bad. Is this too rudimentary for you? I can slow it down a little bit.
Brandon (as Milo): I don’t know why you’re getting aggressive at me?
Eric (as voice): [screaming] I’VE BEEN STUCK IN THIS THING I DON’T KNOW WHAT— [trying to calm down] mmmm, you know what. You can find — look up on the internet, have you used eBay before?
Brandon (as Milo): [chuckles] yes.
[Eric and Brandon laughing]
Eric: Alright so, I think that’s all you’re gonna get out of the spirit at the moment.
Brandon: Alright, well I’m gonna spend the rest of my breaks during that day searching through the archive, looking on eBay coyly asking my manager or anyone else who might know in the museum about who could have a key who used to work with Dr. Morrow, see if I can find any—
Eric: Which one do you wanna do the most? Which one are you gonna lean into?
Brandon: I mean he’s gonna go where his skill sets are which is eBay.
Eric: So at first I wanna make you do an investigation check for the internet but you are skilled in eBay.
Brandon: I am proficient.
Amanda: That’s one of his languages.
Eric: You’re proficient in eBay, so you can add your proficiency bonus, an extra +2 to this thingy.
Julia: So many years trying to find a genuine Mark Hamill signature.
[dice rolling]
Eric: Lots of fake ones out there.
Brandon: What was it?
Amanda: 13
Brandon: Yeah!
Julia: That’s a 15.
Brandon: Uh that rolled under Amanda’s chair but total, that is 13 +3 for 16.
Julia: Oh 16, nice!
Brandon: While he’s at it, he’s also gonna try to find a 64 lunchbox, it’s the one with only bones on it.
Eric: 16 you dig around on eBay for a little while but you do find a key which is for auction.
Brandon: I just wanna say out loud, I’m the only one within like a three-mile radius that know how to use any search filters, so.
Julia: That’s important.
Eric: This has like “Vintage, Real” in all caps, “VINTAGE REAL HISTORIC SCIENCE KEY!”
Brandon: Not haunted!
Eric: Yeah! Not haunted!
Julia: No, it’s definitely haunted.
Eric: And there are five minutes left in this auction.
Amanda: Oh no!
Eric: Right now it’s at like $110.
Brandon: Okay, well I’m gonna load up my sniping program, and enter my max bid, I think I could reasonably get away with $200 bucks from my extra cash I have laying around.
Eric: No 200 is good, okay. So with a 15—
Brandon: I’m not gonna bid immediately, I’m gonna wait til the last one to two seconds and then my program’s going to bid my $200.
Eric: No definitely, for sure, I’m gonna give you advantage I think there needs to be a roll, let’s make it wisdom and again, let’s give you advantage cause you have the sniper program.
Brandon: Alright, well I also have proficiency in this so it’s gonna be a +5.
Julia: Oof!
Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: Wait proficiency in — oh right, eBay.
Brandon: And advantage.
[Dice rolls]
Brandon: Oh. God.
Julia: Please.
[Eric laughing]
[Dice rolls again]
Brandon: That would be a 22, 17 +5
Julia and Amanda: Ooo!!
Julia: Beautiful, the tray did wonders!
Eric: So you put your sniper program in and you’re ready, you have your $200 bid, and you’re ready, it fires up, and you just refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh, and you just see—
Brandon: Excuse me, I don’t refresh, it auto refreshes.
Eric: Oh the auto refresh program refresh, refresh, refresh, refreshes, and the auction is over and it goes to with a bid of $201.13. You lost the bid.
Brandon: With a 22 I lost the bid?!
Julia: Did you roll a nat 20—
Eric: I rolled a nat 20, can you see that?
Amanda: I do see it, yeah.
Eric: It’s true.
Amanda: It’s the kraken on top.
Brandon: Wow. Okay. I have an eBay Premium membership so I can see the screen name of the person who won the bid. Eric: Oh yeah, so it is someone named SergeantSlaughter1991.
Brandon: That is a very aggressive name to put online. So his break is almost done but he’s gonna quickly clear all the cache and history from his work computer, cause he’s not buying lunchboxes on company time.
Eric: No, not at all.
Brandon: That’s ridiculous, did I win that one?
Eric: No that’s fine, I’ll give you that one. Oh and you get a text message! It says
Eric (as Emily): Hey! Milo, this is Emily Slaughter, I saw you on the news! Wild right?
Brandon (as Milo): I wasn’t on the news. I didn’t see that. Send me a link!
Eric: So this is my question, Brandon how long have you lived in Lake Town City?
Brandon: So this is how Milo’s history goes he—
Amanda: Lil’ something like this! Hit it!
Brandon: Lil’ something like this his parents were married and living in Lake Town proper at the time of the incident, and a few years later they had Milo, but they felt that they couldn’t care for a child at the time so Milo was adopted by a single father. The father lived in Lake Town City but as they got you know, older and older he had to move further, and further out to find affordable housing and get closer to his jobs, as they were closer to New York City. So Milo’s lived in Lake Town City like the outskirts for most of his life but he doesn’t really know the inhabitants much of the proper Lake Town, like he knows them because everyone does. But he doesn’t necessarily have close personal relationships. But he has been here for you know almost thirty some odd years, so people know him, he’s a good bowler, and he’s the educator at the science museum. So he has a lot of face time with people.
Julia: Ayy single parent household high five.
Eric: So you never lived in Historic Lake Town proper.
Brandon: Milo did not.
Eric: Milo did not, okay. I’m trying to think, you would know Emily cause Emily is kind of a busy body, she’s like around. As much as you’re like around at bowling stuff, she’s putting together some sort of like benefit, or some sort of party. But you know her family has lived in Historic Lake Town for a while.
Brandon: Yeah, and Milo you know goes to Lake Town City to go get ice cream, and as a teenager fuck with the giant mountain lobster. Like he knows the people around town.
Eric: And she’s definitely lived here for a while, I think the city is small enough that you can like know people, like as people who are around. You might have had her contact in your phone already.
Brandon: Oh yeah, I totally did. Milo’s the kind of person that definitely is good at people, that’s why he’s an educator. So he knows how to talk to people, it’s not like he likes necessarily to be super social but he’s very good at it.
Eric: Sure, yeah so Emily texts you.
Eric (as Emily): Lol, okay, whatever. Y’know we haven’t—
hBrandon (as Milo): SEND ME THE LINK!
Eric (as Emily): Okay fine!
Eric: She sends you a video, an Average Bear article and there’s definitely at least video that’s like “Unknown Man Shot Spirits Out of his Chest. LOL OMG.” There’s a short video that’s from Twitter, that literally shows you the hand reaching out of your chest that changed Tuna.
Julia: I really hope it’s a Boomerang.
Eric: Yeah it’s a Boomerang of it yeah.
[Everyone laughing]
Amanda: Ooo.
Brandon: I text back in all caps
Brandon (as Milo): OMG I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER I LEFT, I MISSED THIS.
[Amanda and Eric laughing]
Eric (as Emily): Lol okay, um hey a bunch of people from Old Lake Town are gonna meet up tonight. I thought it’d be really cool if you came by, I mean I know you don’t really know most of these people, but you’ve always been around, and you know you can meet a bunch of my friends.
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah that sounds awesome!
Eric (as Emily): Alright cool! I’ll see you tonight. It's at 9:00 P.M. and it’s at, well I’ll drop you a pin. Eric: She drops you a pin for the warehouse in between Thornhil and the industry area.
Brandon (as Milo): Awesome thanks, hey thanks for inviting me. Can I bring anything?
Eric (as Emily): Oh bring yourself, bring any friends — or I guess you don’t really know as many… I’m just trying to get as many Lake Town people around so… Brandon (as Milo): Yeah well thanks for including me this time, and for always including me in the Lake Town OGs y’know? I appreciate it. Eric (as Emily): Yeah of course! I want you to meet all these people, it’s been a while.
Amanda: Val brings their own tupperware to parties.
Eric: To save the snacks.
Julia: [laughing] Yes! It’s to take home, not to bring anything.
Amanda: Yes, exactly.
Julia: Cool cool cool.
Brandon: Three minutes later Milo texts back.
Brandon (as Milo): Hey have you been on eBay?
Eric (as Emily): Uh, yeah, I mean, it’s been around for a while for sure, why what’s up?
Brandon (as Milo): Cool, see you tonight!
Eric (as Emily): Okay, bye. Lol, weird.
[Music]
Amanda: Hey, it’s Amanda, to me there’s no form of love more tangible than “oh I made you some food for you last night and I left it in the fridge” and now I don’t have to cook this morning because my smoothie is already made! Hell yeah. This is your pre-prepped breakfast, welcome to the midroll.

And now, let’s get back to the show.
[Music]
Eric: It is now later that night it has come up on nine o’clock. Are y’all going to the meetup?
Brandon: I am, yeah, Milo is. Milo’s gonna do some internet research to try to figure out what else SargentSlaughter has you know posted on and tried to figure out if it is Emily.
Eric: I don’t know with the investigation, yeah you can do it, and it’s all like Lake Town memorabilia. You’re like “yeah that’s definitely Emily”
Amanda: Aggie arrives ten minutes early with yearbooks, pop, and pretzels in hand.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: Val shows up half an hour late, but not before texting their mom a picture of a selfie that they took when they were dog walking earlier with the dog in their sweatshirt.
Amanda: Cute.
Eric: That’s great, I think at the— Julia: Do I get a reply?
Eric: Your mom’s like. Eric (as Val’s mom): Awwww! Eyes emoji, dog emoji.
Julia: Beautiful.
Brandon: Milo’s gonna show up fifteen minutes late, with a six pack and some lunchbox that he imagines Emily might want.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: Like a Monty lunchbox?
Brandon: Yeah like whatever fandom she’s into you know?
Eric: Oh yeah, like a vintage Monty lunchbox?
Amanda: Some like old gift shop overstock.
Brandon: Yeah, but like rare. It’s got a mistake on it, it’s like a mistake printing.
Julia: Monty’s just a shade off of the real thing.
Eric: Monty’s blue for some reason? So weird.
Amanda: Is the six pack from Lake Town City Brewing?
Brandon: Yes of course, of course Milo always buys local.
Amanda: LTCB?
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: Alright, okay great? [laughing] Awesome, all of you guys. Julia: Good world building guys! Start with pizza and breweries!
Eric: No it’s great, I love this, I don’t have to do anything this is awesome! Alright, you all walk over to the warehouse, Aggie when you show up, it’s just Emily. You’re definitely the first person there. You probably know her as well, she’s kind of a busy body, cares a lot about the history of Lake Town. She’s dressed very like she just got off of work at a place that adheres to business casual. She’s probably wearing a pink button down, with a sharp blazer over it, and she has like cool sneakers on under her flowy pants, and she’s like Eric (as Emily): Oh Aggie! Thank you so much for coming!
Eric: She give you a big hug. I don’t know when the last time you saw her is, probably like year and years ago.
Amanda: Yeah I probably ran into her parents around town. Eric: Yeah, definitely.
Amanda (as Aggie): Emily, yeah! I’m glad you’re doing this, it’s great to see you, I brought some of my year books actually from elementary school in case, I dunno. I thought it’d be fun, I can put them back in the car but—
Eric (as Emily): No! Cool! Listen you’re so, it’s your job! Sounds great, it’s awesome!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah! No—
Eric (as Emily): Thanks so much for coming!
Amanda (as Aggie): What have you been up to?
Eric (as Emily): You know? Just this and that, and lots of stuff of always planning something.
Brandon: She’s definitely a drug dealer.
Julia: Oh totally.
Eric (as Emily): No it’s great, I have to receive other people, but it was great to talk to you!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah sure! I’ll just put these in the kitchen, if you need anything take the garbage out that’s you know…
Eric (as Emily): You know it’s kind of like a warehouse so like put it wherever’s not dirty.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh yeah, I don’t get out here much but it’s definitely wow.
Eric (as Emily): I hear the concerts are fun, and loud so I’m down, sounds good to me.
Amanda (as Aggie): I’m more of a quiet with my cat type. But yeah.
Eric (as Emily): Yeah.
Eric: I think later when Milo shows up there’s like more people there, you see some people from high school, some people you’ve fallen out of touch with. This has the vibe of like a tenth high school reunion. Brandon: Milo’s walking through and saying and waving hi to folks
Brandon (as Milo): Oh Anthony! Here I got this sour, I think you’ll like it! Brandon: He gives him the beer from the six pack.
Eric (as Anthony): [in an off-brand Kermit voice] Oh thanks man, I thought I was only gonna have to drink the shitty stuff they got from the keg. But like thanks for the—
Brandon (as Milo): Nah, I remember, I remember!
Eric (as Anthony): Yeah they call me Sour Anthony.
[Everyone starts laughing]
Julia: Now I need to know what the Lake Town City equivalent to a natty light is.
Eric: I think it’s just a natty light.
Julia: Okay that’s fair.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Yeah they just have Natty here it’s stupid. You know Sour Anthony loves Sours.
Brandon (as Milo): Well you know what they say about me I’m the beer rescuer!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Yeah, stop creeping on my Instagram, man.
Eric: He socks you on the arm, and then Val you come in late. There’s a decent amount of people, I think they got like thirty kids. Again, it’s not like a high school reunion and I say “kids” it’s like your peer group. So everyone’s around your age or some people who are siblings of people you might have gone to high school with, other people from the neighborhood for Aggie. Val do you like any of them?
Julia: No, not really.
Amanda: Oh no!
Julia: Val is kind of like the Eleanor Shellstrop of their high school where it’s like they did not want to be involved in any cliques whatsoever, they were not there to make friends. They were there to get their degree and go to SUNY LTC, that’s it.
Eric: Just go and then get out of there.
Julia: Just gotta get that communications degree, Val also notes as they walk in that this is not enough people to mosh with.
[Everyone laughing] Eric: I want all of you to make perception checks to see if you recognize anybody.
[Dice rolling]
Brandon: I got a 9 +5 for 14! Eric: Alright.
Julia: I also got a 14.
Amanda: 23.
Julia: Daamn, perceptive!
Eric: We’re gonna go low to high so we’re going to start with Val here, Val you see Shannon Redwine is here, and she uh—
Brandon: Her last name is Redwine?
Eric: Her last name is Redwine. Brandon: Cool.
Amanda: It’s an old Irish last name, Brandon, don’t be offensive.
Brandon: Does she like red wine?
Eric: Probably, uh she—
Julia: Does it go to her head? Brandon: Is she tired of that joke?
Eric: Yes, she’s definitely tired of that joke, she was very popular in high school, and she was a big ‘ol bully to you. Big jerk, but she’s definitely there with some sycophant friends around her, and you can say that she hasn’t really changed so much since high school. With a 14, Milo, you see that Sour Anthony has a beer in one hand, but he also has a ziplock bag of just like snacks he brought from home and he’s been housing it like all night, like popping little somethings, like chips or something from the ziplock into his mouth.
Brandon: As Milo’s walking back from the table where he put the six pack he passes Anthony and grabs a handful.
Eric: Make a slight of hand check.
Brandon: It’s not slight of hand, he’s being bold about it. Eric: I know, make a slight of hand check.
Brandon: Oh, okay.
Julia: They’re drugs. [Dice rolling]
Amanda: Oh noo.
Julia: They’re drugs, Brandon.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: You know, drugs you can smack.
Brandon: You know, just pills, pills, pills. Okay, 10?
Eric: Hmm, I think with a 10 you like tap Sour Anthony on one shoulder and he like looks away and you grab a few from the bag before he noticies and then continue on your way. Cause he was like surreptitiously eating it a little bit, it’s not like secret, but it’s more like “I brought this and this is mine” sort of way. It’s like you know Brad Pitt in the Ocean’s movies? Like he’s always just like snacking on something.
Amanda: It’s not for anyone except for him.
Eric: Exactly.
Brandon: But Milo is the kind of confident where he’s kind of like “I gave you a beer now we have a deal, so I’m gonna walk past you, take your snacks and you can’t say anything about it.”
Eric: Did you wanna just try to take it from him?
Brandon: Well, yeah, cause it’s not like he actually wants a snack, he’s just saying that this is how I bond with Anthony.
Eric: Okay, yeah, you just try to go up to him and grab a snack.
Brandon (as Milo): What up, Anthony?
Eric: And immediately he covers it. Eric (as Anthony): [Kermit voice] Hey uh uh, Milo you know this is my - uh I need this for uh, I brought this from home man, I only have a few.
Brandon (as Milo): That’s fine man, it’s okay, it’s okay! Send me the recipe later?
Eric (as Anthony): Yeah definitely! Do I still have your number?
Brandon (as Milo: Yeah, you should! It hasn’t changed.
Eric (as Anthony): It stays the same, that’s cool!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah it hasn’t changed since, uh, the sixth grade.
Eric (as Anthony): Okay so I’ll just text you! They’re real good, it’s just they’re the only ones I have and I have a very sensitive stomach!
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, send me the recipe! I’ll make you some next time!
Eric (as Anthony): Okay!
Amanda: Sours and puppy chow only.
Eric: With a 23 I would say, I’m gonna give you two. Amanda, notice that there’s just like a horse in there?
Amanda: What?
Julia: I’m sorry?
Eric: There’s a horse in the warehouse.
Amanda: Where?
Eric: In like the back corner.
Brandon: Is it hiding?
Eric: It’s not like it’s hiding, you assume it’s for something but it’s just like there’s a horse here. Amanda: Is it okay?
Eric: Yeah! It’s fine, it’s just tied up and it’s kinda handing out.
Amanda: Does it have clean water and hay and a little bit of food?
Eric: It looks fine, but it’s just like there.
Amanda: That’s strange, okay, great!
Eric: The other thing you see, you see that there’s a guy with sunglasses on even though it’s dark, and a hat pulled down over his face and it’s for the mountain lobsters.
Amanda: Mountain lobster’s hat, and I don’t recognize them at all?
Eric: They’re trying to like look a little incognito, but you see that this person is trying to look inconspicuous. Amanda: Great, I stride over, stick out my hand and say
Amanda (as Aggie): Aggie O’Hare, nice to meet you!
Julia: But Amanda, there’s a horse loose in this warehouse.
Amanda: I’ll get to the horse, Julia, I’ll get to the horse!
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: He’s a guy with a well-maintained big beard. He’s trying to stay kind of low with a jacket up like Eric (inconspicuous person): [With a low gruff voice as the inconspicuous guy] Hey, hi uh, [A beat of silence.] Eric (as inconspicuous person): nice to meet you.
Eric: He shakes your hand.
Amanda (as Aggie): Sorry it’s just I know a lot of people around here, I kinda know everyone in town, who’d you come with?
Eric (as inconspicuous person): Uh, you know, I, Emily invited me so. You know, Aggie, it’s nice to - nice to, you don’t have to—
Amanda (as Aggie): No I just wanna make sure everyone feels welcome, and just like say hi and stuff. If you’re uncomfortable I can go, I just wanted to say, and yeah.
Eric (as inconspicuous person): Okay, uh
Eric: He looks around like over both shoulders.
Eric (as inconspicuous person): Can you, can you keep a secret?
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah…
Eric: They take off their sunglasses and you realize that this is Fritz Brightstone, who is the leading scorer of the Mountain Lobsters. He is like a local celebrity, in the way that if I don’t know if this is a basketball reference, but it’s as if Damian Lillard was walking around Portland. They’d be like “oh shit, that’s Damian Lillard!” you know? Like he’s a local celebrity. You would know that the Brightstones also had a house here. But you didn’t know him because he immediately like, with hockey it’s like you immediately go into the juniors year juniors, and then he was like in Russia when he was 15 for a while.
Amanda: Like in Canada constantly.
Eric: Yeah and then he got drafted by the Mountain Lobsters now he’s their leading scorer, he’s around your age.
Julia: His name is Fritz Brightstone?
Eric: Yeah, Fritz Brightstone.
Amanda: Cool, cool.
Eric (as Fritz Brightstone): Yeah, so Aggie, just like, you know don’t tell people I’m here.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, no, yeah no, that’s tight I think I knew your parents and your siblings and stuff back in the day. I think you might have trained with my brother Ryan, he’s a snowboarder and a swimmer, and is always over in the training facility over in Lake Placid and like yeah, no, that’s great!
Eric (as Fritz): Oh wow, Ryan. No, no I know Ryan, we go way back he- did he ever play hockey? He picked up a stick, we were doing it for fun and we were all just playing hockey together and he was so good.
Amanda (as Aggie): He was always that way, you know, my parents made him pick two sports to concentrate on—
Eric (as Fritz): And they let him pick one with snowboarding?!
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah, he made a strong case and I think it was mostly for chicks to be honest with you, but uh, you know.
Eric (as Fritz): Classic Ryan, classic Ryan.
Amanda (as Aggie): He has the medals to prove it.
Eric (as Fritz): Yeah, for sure. Hey your parents sound sick, they must be very- I bet you were allowed to do whatever you want and you just like had your wild shit and then you came back for government stuff, yeah.
Amanda (as Aggie): You know, that’s kinda how it was. I’m the oldest of the seven of us so I kinda kept the other ones in check, but you know, I’m the only one still here and, hey how’s the new stadium? It looks really sick from the outside.
Eric (as Fritz): Oh hey, can we just not, listen we can talk later, just don’t talk about the hockey stuff here. Amanda (as Aggie): Oh, okay!
Eric: And at this point Emily is like Eric (as Emily): Hi everybody! Hello!
Eric: She’s trying to get everybody’s attention, and then Fritz like slinks off to try and stay incognito.
Amanda: I give him a little nod.
Julia: I have a clarifying question.
Amanda: Yeah?
Julia: Does Ryan compete in both the Winter and Summer Olympics?
Amanda: He sure does, Julia, because Ryan doesn’t believe in the off season.
[Everyone laughing]
Julia: Good, I like Ryan.
Eric: Hundred percent, Ryan O’Hare is a monster.
Amanda: Yes, checks out.
Eric: Yeah so, Emily gets everybody’s attention
Eric (as Emily): Hello, hi everybody! Thank you so much for coming, I know this was on kind of a short notice but I wanted all of us to get together and to see each other, and you know just kind of hang out. I think you’re all kind of wondering what you’re doing here and I can say you know this is a place where all of us kind of know each other, and it’s kind of cool, and you know we can talk about Lake Town things and stuff. It’s nice to see all of you! Yeah! Lake Town!
Eric: Everyone kind of just does a tepid applause.
Brandon and Julia (as audience members): Wooo! Yeah!
Julia: Very low applause. Eric (as Sour Anthony): [in a Kermit voice] Aw hell yeah dude!
Amanda: [chanting] Moun-tain-lob-sters-moun-tain-lob-sters! Brandon: [joining in] MOUN-TAIN-LOB-STERS!
Amanda: [makes a bird cawing noise]
Brandon: What?!
Eric: Did you just caw?
Julia: I think it’s a bulublu.
Eric: [laughing] Yeah! Blululubuh, yeah you take all of your fingers and you put it near your face and go “bllululbul!” It’s very loud when you get ten thousand people in an arena.
Julia: Lot of spit.
Brandon: Uhhh.
Eric: Yeah, they uh, yeah.
Amanda: The whole stadium is a splash zone.
Eric: [laughing] The fan section is called “The Splash Zone”
Amanda: But it’s every section.
[Eric continues laughing]
Eric (as Emily): You know honestly, with there such a great turnout, I really just wanted to say, I think the people who are here, like the children of Lake Town and representatives of Lake Town City, I always thought that we were not better, but I always had a good feeling about all of us. I love our community, and I love all of you, and I think we can do something that’s really good for this town, and for this city! I’m just gonna come out and say it, uh… I can kill people with a sword.
Amanda (as Aggie): Umm… Brandon (as Milo): So can everybody!
Julia (as Val): Yeah, that’s what swords do.
Eric (as Emily): No, uh—
Amanda (as Aggie): I thought you were gonna run for mayor! This is unexpected. Eric (as Emily): I mean, yeah, eventually, but I you know while I was running all of this stuff, and I have always been really good with a sword, like moreso. I know that’s a weird thing to say in 2020, but like I’ve been studying the blade. But it’s serious—
Julia: While you were watching anime!
Eric: Yeah [chuckles]
Eric (as Emily): But here’s what I mean.
Eric: And she has like a stage crew, and these two guys pull out a punching bag, and Emily walks over to a corner where she takes out not an anime man, but it’s like a katana and it glows purple when she touches it.
Eric (as Emily): Let me show you what I mean!
Eric: She centers herself for a moment and she focuses on the punching bag and she opens the katana and closes it, nothing seems to happen. But it’s like that anime thing where you look over and then half of the punching bag just falls off with a slash.
Julia: They move so quickly.
Amanda: Where it slides away.
Eric: Yeah and then the bottom half of the punching bag just slides down.
Eric (as Emily): That’s what I mean, I’m really good at swords. I didn’t know how else to say it, I think that all of us, uh… I think all of us are really good at stuff we have a power? I’m not exactly sure where it comes from, but I think all of us can do more than we say we can! There’s some weird stuff happening in the city, and I think we can do something about it.
Brandon: Milo leans over to Val and is like
Brandon (as Milo): Yo, are you buying this?
Julia (as Val): Who the fuck are you? OH!
Brandon (as Milo): Sorry… Sorry, what? Julia: Val just kind of look at him like
Julia (as Val): You’re that nerd!
[Eric starts laughing]
Julia (as Val): You’re that dude that when the police got there last night, you fucking raised your hands.
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, that’s kinda what you do when the police get there…
Amanda: Aggie spots you two and walks around the back of the crowd and says
Amanda (as Aggie): So are we gonna talk about this… Like here? Brandon (as MIlo): Talk about what?
Amanda (as Aggie): What went down last night.
Julia (as Val): Prep school Emily? No.
Brandon (as Milo): What went down last night?
Amanda (as Aggie): Saw you become a shadow, bud.
Julia (as Val): We all fuckin’ saw you there turn into a shadow and also divine shit and whatnot.
Amanda (as Aggie): And are you - do you have super speed? Is that your thing? I’m Aggie, I remember you.
Julia (as Val): Yes, we talked. I punch stuff real good.
Amanda (as Aggie): Alright cool.
Julia (as Val): Cool, you also punch stuff real good.
Amanda (as Aggie): I do punch, but also I can like anti-punch like I—
Julia (as Val): That’s fucking cool!
Eric: [laughing] I can anti-punch.
Julia (as Val): I don’t know what that means but it’s very cool.
Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah chill, okay.
Eric (as Emily): Yeah I thought it was really important to bring this up because I think we all saw the news at the auction when those guys hit the bank auction, you know those three—
Eric: And then she points at the three of you and everyone turns around.
Julia (as Val): Where’s Grift Store?! [Everyone laughing]
Julia (as Val): I thought we were gonna see a band here.
Eric (as Emily): You three obviously have it, and I know that you have connections to Lake Town. Listen, all of us are similar, we all grew up in the same place, all of our parents look super good, and we have - I know we have something. It’s something that we can do together to fight off these guys! I think if we all work together and used our, I guess, what am I gonna call it powers? I guess, if we can all use our powers for good, then we can clean up the city and be something and do something! I don’t know um…
Eric: At this point I think a few people are just kind of walking out the back, and are leaving. We’re down to about twenty people now.
Julia: Does the horse leave?
Eric: The horse is still there.
[Everyone laughing] Brandon: Thank god they didn’t take the horse on stage.
Julia: I’m convinced that the horse is one of the people.
Amanda: Yeah, yes.
Amanda (as Aggie): So do you know why someone tried to rob the bank last night?
Eric (as Emily): Yeah, you know what? I actually have a good idea, I’m pretty good at digging stuff up, I kinda know a lot of people and I know who it was. There’s a gang of guys who are all calling themselves The Nephews, they’ve been hitting up the banks over the summer. But now they did something big, they were going after the auction for some reason and a few of the guys got picked up. Who knows if they’ll stay in police custody, but we can do something about it! Like this isn’t going to be the end of it, the police aren’t doing anything. The mayor is kind of just sweeping this under the rug, we can do something! Right?
Eric: At this point more people are kind of walking out the back, we’re down to fifteen people. Julia: I have a question.
Eric: Sure,
Julia: In the news articles that were posted, was there anything about the Night of Mirrors?
Eric: Yeah they did say there were like people kicking ass, I think that’s when you all got profiled, and the Night of Mirrors was as well like [in a newsperson voice] “there was a person on a motorcycle with mirrors!” and there was also a video, because they did kick ass as well.
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh! Does one of you have a reflective motorcycle? Was that someone here?
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Hey? What? What, that doesn’t make any sense!
Amanda (as Aggie): Someone rode through the robbery on like a sick motorcycle, right guys?
Brandon (as Milo): Oh! I saw that in the videos yeah!
Julia (as Val): [quietly] Yeah, it was pretty sick.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, Milo, you were there!
Julia (as Val): We saw you there!
Eric (as Emily): Milo, we know you were there! We all—
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah I was there and I ran out!
Eric (as Emily): Yeah, Milo I didn’t wanna put you on blast, but there were ghosts coming out of your chest…
Brandon (as Milo): [mockingly] Uh, okay.
Amanda (as Aggie): Listen, I’ll say it, my parents are in their sixties, and they look like they’re 35, and look I brought it.
Amanda: Aggie pulls out an elementary school yearbook and a high school yearbook and in all of them they have candids of families and kids at field day and at graduations and stuff like that, and she opens to one page with a group shot of her class, kids and parents and they look identical from 1996 to when they graduated in 2008.
Eric: Oh that’s great.
Julia (as Val): This is true, my mom is still very hot.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Yeah-yeah she is!
Brandon (as Milo): Wait... wait… hold up—
Julia (as Val): [Yelling] Shut the fuck up, Sour Anthony!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): No you shut the fuck up, Val! Julia (as Val): I will punch you in the face.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Oh I bet you will! Yeah come over here I bet—
Brandon (as Milo): Alright, alright—
(Everyone yelling)
Brandon (as Milo): Stop, STOP. Hang on, hang on!
Julia: I punch you in the face.
Eric: Alright, do you wanna get in the middle?
Brandon: Yeah, I’m trying to—
Eric: Alright so everyone’s gonna make [laughing] a strength roll—
Amanda: Not me!
Eric: Sour Anthony, I’m gonna roll for Sour Anthony.
[Dice rolling]
Julia: So that is a 13!
Brandon: Milo got a 2.
Amanda: Aww babe.
Julia: [laughing] We’re just gonna knock you down.
Eric: So order of operations, first you just, Val what do you do to Milo?
Julia: I think I just sweep him to the side.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay, okay, okay, okay, I am getting outta the way now!
Julia: It’s not a rage,
Brandon (as Milo): You are very large and strong.
Eric: You try to get your—
Julia: I am very smol and strong.
Brandon (as Milo): You are very small and strong.
Eric: Very dense, like a neutron star! You try to get your hands on Sour Anthony, but he seamlessly moves backwards and you see that he’s levitating three feet over the ground.
Brandon (as Milo): Ohhh my god.
Julia (as Val): That is fuckin’ cool, not gonna lie. Eric (as Sour Anthony): I told you not to fuck with me! That’s what you’re gonna get!
Julia (as Val): Listen, I’ll fuck with you.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Sour Anthony ride again! Sour waves, baby!
Amanda (as Aggie): Is that your horse?
Julia (as Val): Just cause you can float doesn’t mean I can’t fuck with you, I’m just sayin’. Also Aggie asked a very important question, what is up with the fuckin’ horse?
Brandon (as Milo): There’s a horse?! Oh my god!
Eric: [laughing] The horse looks up and is like
Eric (as the horse): [with a cajun accent] Oh I did not think that anyone would be able to see me, I just a horse standin’ over here!
Julia (as Val): WHAT. IS. HAPPENING?!
Amanda (as Aggie): [surprised] WHAT?!
[Julia laughing]
Julia (as Val): I can deal with levitating Sour Anthony, I cannot deal with a talking horse.
Brandon (as Milo): I cannot deal with literally any of this.
Eric: At this point the horse changes again into a guy about your age who’s just like tech slacker as hell—
Amanda: Oh. My.
Eric: With a hoodie and sweatpants on, with flip flops, even though it’s fall.
Amanda (as Aggie): Man why did you open as a horse?!
Eric (as tech slacker): [Continuing in a cajun accent] I don’t know I just thought it would be a good idea as [it becomes nonsensical cajun fillers]
Julia (as Val): What’s wrong with your mouth dude?
Eric (as tech slacker): [thicker cajun accent] Look when you become an animal for that long, you forget how to English right.
Eric (as Emily): Yeah.. I know about the horse, I knew about the [sighs] I knew about the horse. Gordon, Gordon I told you to stop, for you to just be a horse and not talk about this.
Eric (as Gordon): [Nonsensical cajun fillers]
Brandon (as Milo): Alright, I am just gonna leave now… Um… This is too weird. Um.
Julia: Val just reaches over—
Eric: At the horse part lots of people have cleared out, so right now, Aggie make a perception check.
[Dice rolling]
Amanda: 21!
Eric: Alright with a 21, you see that Fritz is still like lurking in the back, he had tried to walk out while everyone did but now he is legitimately lurking outside. He just had his head peeked in now.
Julia: When Milo goes to leave, Val grabs him by the collar and is like Julia (as Val): No no, ghost boy.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay! Small strong. Guess I’m staying ookaaay.
Amanda: Can I do like an insight check to see how trustworthy this crowd feels?
Eric: Yeah, you wanna do the crowd?
Amanda: Yeah, [dice rolling] 16.
Eric: Alright with a 16, what do you mean the crowd? Ask some questions.
Amanda: Would I be safe here admitting something secret? Does it feel like everybody is here to support each other, or does it feel like there’s a skittish or disbelieving energy?
Eric: I think Emily’s trying really hard to make it seem welcome and open, and a lot of people who didn’t want to deal with this for whatever reason have left. So the people who are still here for the most part that you’ve clocked have already revealed themselves, and right now we’re pretty much down to Sour Anthony— Julia: Jesus.
Eric: The three of you, Emily, and Gordon the horse guy, and you see Fritz is lurking in the back. Julia: I am not starting a superhero team with Sour Anthony and Gordon, I’m sorry.
Brandon: It could’ve been like Porter Anthony. [laughs]
Julia: Could’ve been.
Amanda (as Aggie): Uh is anyone drunk yet? Or sick, have like a cold, or the flu?
Eric (as Sour Anthony): No I’m good man!
Julia (as Val): I would love to be drunk right now.
Brandon (as Milo): I’ve got some beers over there, I brought.
Eric (as Emily): There’s literally a whole keg, I guess we’re all gonna share that.
Brandon (as Milo): Or some local IPA’s, porters, and stouts… Julia (as Val): I was gonna go do a keg stand real quick.
[Everyone laughing]
Eric: You can definitely just do that, I’ll let you just do that, just hounding some beer.
Brandon: Constitution roll or?
Eric (as Emily): Listen, [sighs] I don’t know, this isn’t like comics, this is real like okay? But there’s some weird stuff going down, we need to take down The Nephews and no one would know better about them than us, like they’re based out of Historic Lake Town.
Amanda (as Aggie): No, I’m serious, any cuts, or bruises? Guy in the back, looks like you get into some scraps sometimes. Eric: Gordon steps up and he turns into a dog, and Fritz is like
Eric (as Fritz): Uh, should I do you want me to uh— Amanda (as Aggie): Yeah I just have to show you something, do you have a bruise on your arm or something?
Eric (as Fritz): Yeah, you know I kind of in my [pause] job… I get bruises…
Amanda (as Aggie): Don’t care what your job is buddy, just come here.
Eric (as Fritz): Okay.
Amanda: Aggies steps into the middle of the group.
Eric: Fritz steps forward, do you guys care to make perceptions check on this man?
Julia: Yes, yes, yes!
Brandon: Yeah! [Dice rolling]
Julia: I got a 10.
Brandon: 16 total!
Eric: I think with a 10, Val you don’t recognize this guy. Julia: Aw.
Eric: But with a 16 you’re like “why is this man hiding himself? He looks familiar” You get a sense he looks familiar.
Brandon (as Milo): Yes… I’ve seen you somewhere. Amanda (as Aggie): None from you, thank you.
Amanda: Aggie lays her hand on Fritz’s forearm which there’s a greenish bruise on the side of his bicep and there’s a little zap almost, like a spark jumping from an outlet, and the bruise slowly fades back to his normal skin tone.
Eric (as Fritz): Wow thanks, I really needed that, it was hurting, thanks… From my job. That I have.
Amanda (as Aggie): That’s a thing that happens to me!
Eric (as Emily): Alright, okay, we’re getting somewhere this is good!
Brandon (as Milo): Okay so your parents are the same people from thirty, twenty years ago and you heal bruises. Okay! Taking it all in alright.
Eric (as Emily): You’re taking it all in? You’re the guy who had a ghost hand come out of his body.
Brandon (as Milo): That… What?
Eric: She digs up the video and shows it to you happening.
Amanda (as Aggie): Ah! It’s the same jacket woah!
Brandon (as Milo): Look, I can’t do anything, I cannot do anything.
Julia (as Val): You know man, it’s cool. My aunt had the sight once, like back in the day, so if you talk to ghosts and shit that’s cool, that’s fine. You know?
Brandon (as Milo): I haven’t talked to any ghosts!
Julia: Can I do an insight check!
Eric: Yeah, do an insight check, I’m going to give you advantage.
Julia: Thank you!
[Dice rolling]
Julia: It’s a 12.
Eric: Here’s the thing, even with a 12, Emily is holding the video of Milo doing this and there is Milo. Like you saw him in person.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay, okay, okay. Alright, alright, I cannot do anything I am not like y’all apparently. I do none of this, none of this is me.
Amanda (as Aggie): So what happens to you then?
Brandon (as Milo): I hear some people, and things happen, and there’s a cat.
Julia (as Val): It’s what I said my aunt had the sight it’s the same thing— THERE’S A CAT? There were no ghost cats with my aunt, I’m just sayin’.
[Julia laughing]
Eric (as Emily): Is that where the panther came from?
Julia (as Val): Oh yeah, what the fuck with the panther?
Brandon (as Milo): That was a mistake um…
Amanda (as Aggie): Oh—
Brandon (as Milo): But look, I don’t do any of it, I don’t have any of the things that you guys do.
Eric (as Emily): Listen, I just think we should do something and if anyone here wants to help me, I can pay.
Brandon (as Milo): Look, I-
Julia (as Val): Oh eh, pay?!
Eric (as Emily): I can pay, I have I— we choose three or four of you to come with me, I have $10,000 for each of you.
Brandon and Amanda (as Milo and Aggie): WHAT?
Julia (as Val): Are we talking like a salary position or is this like a commission thing or?
Eric (as Emily): I think it’s like commission while it’s happening, if we get this done and we kick their asses, then I think I can give you the full $10,000. Brandon (as Milo): Where-where did you get like $50,000 to just throw?
Eric (as Emily): Look I got- don’t worry about it.
Amanda (as Aggie): Okay, I can’t quite do that. What is our commission on exactly? If we find stolen merchandise we’re gonna have to return it.
Eric (as Emily): No, I know, we’re gonna return it. We’re gonna put them away!
Brandon (as Milo): Where?! We don’t have a jail!
Eric (as Emily): We’re gonna take down The Nephews and we’re gonna like tie them up and then the police are gonna find them and be like [in a kermit voice] oh nice! Thanks for taking care of them! [Goes back to regular voice] that’s what we’re gonna do.
Amanda (as Aggie): That’s not how— Emily, I just, before I sign off on something like this, you know that keeping Lake Town safe is like my whole thing, but I gotta know why. Like these guys robbed the bank sure but I need to make sure that what we’re doing is for the right reasons and I dunno about breaking the law, but we’ll get there when we have to get there.
Eric (as Emily): Okay, fine alright, um. The Nephews before were just like some punks that were hanging out on the dock and scaring people who would come to Historic Lake— Aggie, you’ve seen them before, those guys that hang out on the docks late at night doing whatever, but they’re organizing. They have a name now and I think that has to do with Ma’s shutting down. But they’re into some weird stuff, but they have things, like where do these goons get tech like that? They get a jet pack? They have lasers and stuff?
Amanda (as Aggie): They did blow up a safe with a computer, that’s true.
Eric (as Emily): That’s, yes! That would be some of the weird stuff, I don’t know who they’re getting this from but they’re collecting money, they’re collecting stuff for something, I want to figure it out, and I want to take them down.
Julia (as Val): We’re all just cool handing people over to the cops? Because I’m not sure that’s a environment I want to be employed in.
Brandon (as Milo): Why?
Eric (as Emily): You can be gone by the time that they’re tied up, it’s fine.
Julia (as Val): You shut up.
[Julia and Brandon laughing]
Amanda (as Aggie): That’s just what I’m saying we need to take care of our own problems but you don’t just jump to conclusions around here.
Eric (as Emily): Alright, fine, we’ll scope it out then we’ll take them down. That’s fine, we can use some more recon, I do need more people. I can’t just do this by myself this is all I know. Everything I told you is what I know. Amanda (as Aggie): Really gotta know who the mirror motorcyclist is because that person has infrastructure, you know what I mean?
Julia (as Val): Mmhmm
Eric (as Emily): I- yeah I don’t know who that is, but we can find that guy too. Let’s do it together! I can’t do it alone! Okay?
Julia (as Val): I’m not working with Sour Anthony. [Everyone laughs]
Julia (as Val): That’s my stipulation!
Eric (as Sour Anthony): [kermit voice] Hey that’s fine I didn’t wanna work with you anyway.
Julia (as Val): Fine, fuck you.
Eric (as Sour Anthony): I’ll work on my own! I don’t even wanna help you, I don’t wanna work with Val.
Amanda (as Aggie): Work on your own on what?
Eric (as Sour Anthony): I’m just gonna go work on my own thing, it’s fine.
Julia (as Val): What are you gonna do? Float at them?
Eric (as Sour Anthony): YEAH! I’m gonna fly!
Eric: And he takes more of his snacks and—
Eric (as Sour Anthony): Yeah I’m gonna fly and take them down.
Brandon (as Milo): Okay look, I don’t know how I can be helpful, but this does sound fun.
Julia (as Val): Maybe with some weird ghost shit I dunno. Eric (as Emily): I’ll take it, fine. Good enough, well, I’m great I’m glad so many of you want to be apart of—
Brandon (as Milo): You’re really good at eBay.
Eric (as Emily): Good I guess the ghosts will tell you about—
Brandon (as Milo): Can we talk later about that?
Julia (as Val): About eBay?
Eric (as Emily): about eBay?
Brandon (as Milo): Yeah, I just have some questions.
Eric (as Emily): Uhh we can talk about—
Brandon (as Milo): Just do the power thing, keep going.
Eric (as Emily): Okay, I’ll do the power thing, okay so—
Julia (as Val): Is this your way of flirting? I’m just trying to get a read on you my dude.
Brandon (as Milo): Definitely not.
Julia (as Val): Okay, good.
Eric (as Emily): Alright we’ll talk about eBay. Julia (as Val): Cause I would be extremely concerned.
Eric (as Emily): Alright well before we go I do need to see what you all can do so um… Let’s all do something fun together, let’s do the obstacle course!
[Techno arcade music starts playing]
Eric: And then the lights in the rest of the warehouse come on and you can see that there’s like an American Ninja Warrior style set-up behind you. Eric (as Emily): I just need to see what you can do, so uh, how about the top four people who do the course wins!
Julia (as Val): Hey Slaughter? Why do you have so much capital? Where are you getting money from?
Julia: Eyeroll.
Eric (as Emily): Alright! Last one there is a rotten egg! GO!

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Last time on Join the Party…
Eric: We meet our characters, Aggie, the caretaker of the Lake Town Historic District and the super for all of the first residents’ bungalows, Milo, a museum educator at the Futurism Museum who can talk to spirits like his ghost, cat, Tuna, and Val, five feet of Italian anger and punk spikes, who works at the oldest pizza place in LTC, Dominic's.
All three of our characters are compelled to go to the charity auction at the First National Bank downtown. As the bidding begins, the doors of the bank burst open as a crew of goons wearing mountain lobster masks scream at everyone to get back and let them do what they're doing.
What will our characters do? Do they remember how attack bonuses work? Is Tuna going to be okay? Let's get the party started.
[theme music]
[electronic action music]
Eric [as goon]: Alright. This is a stick up. We're taking all this stuff back because it's ours.
Eric: And I want all of us to roll Initiative.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 19.
Julia: That's an 8.
Brandon: Julia, I also got 8!
Julia: Why are we twinsing?
Brandon: I don’t know!
Julia: Twins on my higher ones, please.
Eric: Alright, so these bank robbers and thugs wearing mountain lobster masks have just dropped a flashbang into the auction hall.
Amanda: What does a lobster's face look like, though?
Eric: It kind of just looks like a, you know the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: It’s like the face of the shrimps.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: But it actually is just the face of it. Hundred percent. So everybody is kind of like either blinded and disoriented, or just freakin’ afraid. Everyone is kind of like crouched down in the crowd where Val and Milo are. The auctioneer is ducked behind the podium, and the stuff is just all out. Three of the thugs are in the auction area at the moment.
Aggie, you're currently outside of the bank. You can go into the main bank, and then you take like a right. And on the right side of the building is where the auction hall is. So we're gonna do our first Initiative. We're gonna do our first fight, everybody.
All: Yay!
Eric: Yay, let’s go kick some ass. But of course, because I have feelings about Initiative, we're gonna do this a little differently. Because the thugs obviously have a job to do and they are doing whatever they're doing - but they seem like they're sticking up to the bank and the people there - they know what they're doing. They are on a plan. This is like a heist for them. They are running in. They’re kicking ass.
So, for everybody else, I'm putting a 30 second timer on you figuring out what to do in order to keep things going. If you miss your turn or you go over 30 seconds, your turn is just delayed. It is pushed back after the next person who goes, and that can include the enemies of who are there and then you are stuck in that new Initiative.
For example, if Aggie, you- you go first. But if you miss it, you would get pushed back behind the enemies. Also think that I want to do, because this always bothers me in Dungeons & Dragons content - let's all say everybody's classes so we just know. I know we have an After Party and we’re going to get into it. But it's like functionally I would love to have everybody be able to talk about their classes. And then as you do stuff, your subclass might come up. Whoever wants go first.
Julia: Val is a Path of the Battle ranger barbarian.
Amanda: Aggie is a Way of Tranquility monk.
Brandon: Milo is a reskinned Circle of Spores druid.
Amanda: Mushrooms!
Eric: We’re gonna talk about what the hell was going on with Milo at another point, but it is - we combined the Circle of Spores with a different subclass to make it more about fuckin’ ghosts.
Julia: About fucking ghosts?
Amanda: Oh…
Eric: About just bangin’ ghosts.
Brandon: That does not happen.
Eric: Alright. So is everybody ready?
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah. Let's do it.
Eric: Okay, I'm going to put 30 seconds on the clock, and Aggie go.
Amanda: I'm going to run after the robber that I disarmed into the bank and try to knock him out so that he can't participate in the heist.
Eric: Alright, cool. So do you want to trip him, or you just want to engage him again?
Amanda: Well, I’m gonna ahead and grip the end of my walking stick, and do a little like twist and pull action and the cap comes off and it's a spear.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: So I'm gonna go ahead and stab him in the shoulder.
Julia: Hey, what?!
Brandon: Oh my god!
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Alright, cool. So that –
Julia: You walk around the city with a spear?
Amanda: You know, Julia, you never know when you need something very sharp to, like, cut down a tree branch that is potentially hurting people.
Julia: Sure.
Brandon: You know in electronics when you have to hit the reset button that’s very small? It's very useful.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: Alright. Got 12 + 5 for 17.
Eric: That hits.
Amanda: Excellent. That is 1d8 + 3.
[dice rolls]
Got 7 damage.
Eric: Alright.
Amanda: As a monk, I get to do an unarmed strike as a bonus action after my attacks, so I’m gonna go ahead and roll for that.
Eric: You’re…
Amanda: Just do a little shove.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a 12.
Eric: 12 does not hit. So you stab him with the spear in the shoulder. He’s like,
Eric [as goon]: Hey what the hell?!
Eric: But you try to get him with your el- like an elbow up, and you are able to connect.
Amanda: Well, whatever remaining movement I have, I'm going to continue running past him, assuming that he is hopefully limping or down- to try to see what's going on inside the main auditorium.
Eric: Alright, make a Dexterity roll to see if you can avoid him without him taking the opportunity attack on you.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 15.
Eric: [muttering] Let me roll Dexterity.
[dice rolling]
Eric: He rolled a 3! So you run on by.
Amanda: Good job.
Eric: There's like another 40 foot hallway that connects the main bank building to the auction area. So if you're running to the main bank area, you're going to take a right at that hallway. So you're in the hallway. You aren't able to make it back to everybody else yet.
Amanda: Okay. So let's use a key point to dash, which doubles my movement speed so that I can make it into the auditorium proper.
Eric: Let's go! Amanda, fucking metagaming. Alright, make a Perception check.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 13.
Eric: Okay. As you are running down the hallway, you see that you can take a left. There's like a fork in the hallway. To the left, you can go towards the offices and the vault, and then if you go straight, you go on to the auditorium.
Amanda: I think my duty here is to make sure this event is going well, so I'm going to prioritize the safety of – [others chucking] No, I'm just saying like that – that’s what I'm concerned about right now. Not the- not the vault and hoping that bank has security. So I'm going to go for the auditorium
Brandon: You’re going to go in the auditorium like, “Who needs a refill?!”
Amanda: No! I want to protect and serve.
Eric: Is everyone having a good time?!
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: I'm having a blast personally.
Amanda: These are important artifacts!
Eric: No, I just thought that was really sweet. That was very cute. Alright. So I'm going to do the thugs. So there are three of them in there.
So these guys are wearing all black, plus the pink mountain lobster mask they have on. One of them is holding a shield that looks like it's made out of some sort of wrought metal. It seems pretty lightweight and easy to carry. And the guy holding the shield also has one of the electrified sticks. Much like what Aggie was fucking around with the other guy with.
There is another one who hits a button on his chest and a jetpack pops out of his backpack, and he flies up on the jet pack. He's not very stable on it, but he flies up on the jetpack just to get like a survey of the whole room and to see what's happening there.
Amanda: You can’t get that in New York City, now, can ya?
Eric: So he's like
Eric [as jetpack goon]: [unstable] Oh! Oh!
Eric: So like go over to the right to go over to left, just try to be stable while the guy with the shield is kind of like threatening everybody.
One of the other guys is holding a bag over his shoulder and he's looking around and he's saying,
Eric [as bag goon]: Hey!
Eric: He talks to the guy, says,
Eric [as bag goon]: Hey, where's Crawdad? Where is he? Where - there are four of us. Where is he?
Eric: And the other two are like
Eric [as goons]: Eh, I don't know.
Eric: And the one on the jetpack is like scanning the room and is like,
Eric [as jetpack goon]: Yeah I don't - I don't know where is is. I don’t see him.
Eric: He's like,
Eric [as bag goon]: I'm going to go in on the plan. Mud Bug, you get the rest of them fresh. Keeping it fresh. Keep an eye out. We're going to keep going with that plan regardless where that idiot is.
Eric: Aggie, I want you to make a Dexterity roll against each other.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 21.
Eric: Okay, with a 21, the guy with the bag on his shoulder tries to run back towards the split in the hallway, and-
Amanda: I stick out my foot and trip him,
Eric: Alright. Make an- so you can make an Opportunity attack against him, yeah.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 11.
Eric: That does not hit. You stick your foot out -
Amanda: Can I do my second luck point of three and reroll it?
Eric: Oh, goddamn. Yeah.
Julia: Get three a day?
Amanda: Three a day. That’s a 16
Eric: [chucking] Lucky is a good feat huh?
Amanda: Sure is.
Eric: Did you want to trip him or do you want to – you want to hurt him?
Amanda: I want to trip him nastily so that he knocks himself out.
Eric: [laughing] Okay, I'm going to give you two choices. You can do damage to him or you can knock him prone.
Amanda: Let's knock him prone so all the baddies are within our kind of sight lines.
Eric: Okay, so as – [laughing] as the guy whose holding the bag over his shoulder, you trip him and knock him on his ass.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: He’s like,
Eric [as goon 3]: What? What is happening? We're just trying to get. We're just trying to get in here and do our job!
Eric: The guy reaches into his bag and takes out what looks like a laser gun, shoots it at you. What is your AC?
Amanda: 15.
Eric: Well, I rolled a 9, so he takes out the laser gun and he shoots it at you and it's just like his this viscous green ooze comes out of the gun and it goes - it wings past your left shoulder. And there's just like this green nasty slime on the ground next to you.
Amanda [as Aggie]: The hell is that?!
Eric [as goon 3]: Uh, I don't know. I thought… it's supposed to hurt you!
Amanda [as Aggie]: There’s nice carpet in here. What are you doing?
Eric: And now the carpets is like bubbling under the slime.
Amanda: Ugh, gross.
Eric: It’s pretty nasty. The guy in the jetpack takes out a little laser gun and just kind of like, threatens at everybody while he's trying to be stable on the jet pack. He’s like,
Eric [as jetpack goon]: If anybody moves, I gotcha.
Eric: So he's gonna hold his action for that. And Mud Bug, the guy with the shield is gonna take out another just empty bag and start taking stuff and putting it in the bag.
Amanda: Love to see them steal an arm chair.
Brandon: How little gun?
Eric: You know [giggles] it’s just a little hand-sized gun. Little hand-sized laser gun.
Julia: It’s like the very small one from “Men in Black.”
Brandon: Yeah that’s what I was thinking.
Eric: Milo, it is now your turn.
Brandon: Okay, Milo is caught off guard. He's going to drop down to his knees so he's underneath the chairs.
Brandon [as Milo]: Shit, shit, shit, shit! Tuna! Tuna! I need you! And I'm gonna cast wild companion to summon Tuna.
Eric: Sure. Tuna pops up in front of you and be like,
Eric [as Tuna]: Hey, what's going on? I was sleeping.
Brandon [as Milo]: [frantic] Look around! I don't know exactly what's happening, but Tuna, I'm scared, and you know what happens if I'm scared so what I need from you is to eat this treat and then put a stop to this please!
Eric [as Tuna]: What am I- What am I really supposed to do? I'm a cat. Do you want me to jump on someone?! What am I supposed to do?
Brandon [as Milo]: So when I give Tuna the treat, I'm casting Shillelagh, which is a bonus action. I just.
Amanda: Yeah!
Brandon: The name Shillelagh is silly so I’m gonna do Treat for now.
Eric: Amanda, the Irish person likes it.
Amanda: My history, my heritage, Brandon.
[Brandon laughs]
Brandon: And what that does is for the duration of the spell, I get to use my spell casting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls. And the weapons damage becomes a d8 instead of Tuna's normal…
Julia: Cat stats.
Eric: Yeah, his cat stats.
Brandon: 1d1 slashing damage.
Eric: Oh [laughing]
Julia: Mmm 1d1.
Brandon: Milo’s like,
Brandon [as Milo]: Eat the treat. Eat the treat, You know what to do. Please help. Otherwise you know what’s gonna happen. And it happened before, except with no one else in the room so please help figure this out.
Eric [as Tuna]: Okay. Oh, a treat! Nomnomnom.
Eric: And Tuna’s gonna eat the treat.
Brandon [as Milo]: So – there’s a guy over there. Go take him down!
Eric [as Tuna]: [nonchalantly] I’ll think about it.
Eric: That’s good. This is the other guy's turn. So the one who who doesn't have the weapon, who's also running in –
Amanda: Mud Bug.
Eric: Crawdad.
Amanda: Crawdad.
Eric: Crawdad got disoriented after Aggie came and threatened him, so now he's trying to run by Aggie as well. Aggie, make a Dexterity throw to see if you can stop him.
[dice rolling]
Eric: Yeah, you catch him so you can make an Opportunity attack as he tries to run by you.
Amanda: Let’s do it. Get his other shoulder. [dice rolling] 14+ 5.
Eric: Yeah, that hits.
Amanda: Alright. I got 5+3 for 8 points of damage.
Eric: God, you are just messing up Crawdad’s day. He’s like,
Eric [as Crawdad]: Aw geez it’s the lady from before! Oh, no!
Eric: But he runs by you. And now he's gonna go in to the auction room and be like,
Eric [as Crawdad]: Oh, hey guys, sorry, I got held up this lady. There's a terrible lady outside. I do not like her.
Eric: And he's going to go help Mud Bug put stuff into a sack.
Amanda: How's he lookin’ like constitution-wise?
Eric: You have been beating them up a little bit, like he looks pretty bad.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: Alright, it is now Val’s turn.
Julia: How far are these guys from me?
Eric: What is your speed?
Julia: 30.
Eric: If you want to, like, get up all in their biz, you can cross the room if you would like.
Julia: With 30?
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Okay, so I'm gonna go into a rage.
Eric: Great.
Brandon: Yay!
Julia: Which for Val - Val is just frustrated as hell, like,
Julia [as Val]: I was just about to get the fucking chair!
Julia: And then starts vibrating.
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: And just like streaks across the room and is going to…
Amanda: Smack them with a briefcase! Smack them with the briefcase!
Julia: Reckless attack.
[Eric laughing]
Julia: I actually do like the idea of just hitting them with the briefcase because it's the first thing that comes to their mind.
Eric: Alright. Who are you hitting? So there's Crawdad who doesn't have a weapon, There's Mud Bug who does have a weapon, and there's the guy flying around.
Julia: Um, let's go with Crawdad.
Eric: Alright.
Julia: Let’s just take care of one guy.
Eric: Just taking care of Crawdad! [singing] Taking care of Crawdad every day. Taking care of Crawdad and working overtime.
Julia: Okay, so it's a 19 plus I'm in a rage, so it is plus 3.
Eric: Yeah. You got ‘em. Yeah, you got ‘em.
Julia: Cool, cool, cool. You sure?
Eric: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Julia: What are my stats with the bag stuff? [laughing]
Eric: It does your regular damage. It doesn’t give you any penalty. Remember, the bag is also strangely heavy, so if you want to do something about that, you can-
Amanda: Maybe an extra d4 of damage or something…
Julia: Alright, so it's 1 d6 plus my strength. So it's a 1+3, plus an additional 2. So that is 5.
Eric: Wonderful. You do 5 damage. Yeah [chuckling] I just like that you smack him with the briefcase. He’s like,
Eric [as Crawdad]: Everyone hates me! I don't know why!
Julia [as Val]: I wanted to get home early!
Eric: At this point, the guy in the jetpack will be like,
Eric [as goon 2]: I told you, I told you to stay!
Eric: So they're going to attack you.
Julia: Fine. Glad I did reckless attack then.
[dice rolling]
Eric: Well, that's an 8.
Julia: Yeah, nope, not gonna hit.
Eric: No, that does not hit. So they're still very unstable on jet pack and they’re like,
Eric [as goon 2]: Whoa, whoa!
Eric: And they do a barrel roll, and their laser shot just goes ping ping ping! And shoots all over the room.
Amanda [as Aggie]: That's a nice plaster ceiling!
Eric: Aggie is now - we're back around. It is now your turn.
Amanda: Okay. I like where this spiky shouldered person's head is at taking care of the one who is almost nearly down. So I'm going to once again go ahead and try to knock with the end of the spear, Crawdad’s head.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: And 19 + 5 for 24.
Eric: Alright, that hits.
Amanda: Got a 2 + 3 - 5 damage.
Eric: Alright.
Amanda: And I'll do my extra unarmed strike as well, giving him just a- just a have punch to the face, please.
Eric: Oh, no. What a day.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: Got another 20 for attack roll.
Eric: That hits.
Julia: Jesus, monk.
Amanda: Then d4 + 3, so 1+3, 4 damage.
Eric: Alright. Four damage. Man, you guys are just wailing on Crawdad. He's like,
Eric [as Crawdad]: Everyone else are doing crimes! Why is this just me?
Julia [as Val]: Because you're the weakest.
[Amanda laughs]
Eric: It is now Mud Bug’s turn, and the winged guy, the winged guy is going to –
Amanda: I gotta know his name.
Eric: Oh, his name is Fresh.
Amanda: Fresh. So then who has the shield and the electric stick?
Eric: Mud Bug has an electric stick. Crawdad does not have an electric stick.
Julia: Who has the shielf?
Eric: They both have shields.
Julia: Oh, okay.
Eric: While Fresh has just a jetpack.
Amanda: Okay, we're missing then a fourth guy who has a shield and electric stick.
Julia: Crawdad, Mud Bug, Fresh.
Eric: So Yabby. He's the one running –
Julia: Got it! Yabby!
Amanda: Yabby!
Eric: They are the one -they're the one running towards the vault.
Julia: Gotcha.
Eric: So they're they're pissed that you're getting at them. Mud Bug is going to swing on Val. And they have advantage because they're together. It makes it easier for them to swing. And that was non-natural 20. And that hits for… 5 piercing damange to you.
Julia: So that's halfed. Because I have rage resistance.
Amanda: Yup!
Julia: So is that a 2 or 3?
Eric: 2.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: You lucky bastard.
Julia: Thank you!
FR Hey! Nobody messes with my with my pal like that. We're mountain lobsters together!
Eric: The flying jaboke is going to fire at Aggie.
Amanda: Hope he says like, “That's fresh!” or “Fresh direct!”
FR “Fresh to death!”
Eric: And then he fires at you.
[dice rolling]
Eric: That is a 17.
Amanda: That hits.
Eric: Okay, that does 6 damage. And then you don't see Yabby, who is doing something else. Runnin’ a different way. It is now Milo’s turn.
Brandon: So Yabbie is doing something else in the other direction. Can you give me a status report on the other three?
Eric: Yeah. So the one that’s flying is just shooting down at Aggie. Crawdad, the one without a weapo, is just getting the shit kicked out of him by Val and Aggie, and Mud Bug has stopped putting stuff in a sack to swing on Val to try to help out.
Brandon: Okay. So two things to note of. I have a feature called Symbiotic Entity, which means that second level I gain the ability of channel magic into spirits that infuse me. So that's sort of what I'm doing with – when I feed Tuna the treat.
I awaken spirits rather than transform into a druid animal. When I do that, I get three temporary hit points per level, and the damage of my Halo of Spirits feature doubles, and my melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
Eric: Nice. So what does this look like when you “go ghost,” to use a Danny Phantom phrase?
Julia: Oh my god.
Brandon: Yeah. I don't think I like- in terms of like metagame, I don't think at this low level I have like a visible change, but it feels like a warm bath starting from my toes and going all the way up to my head.
Eric: Nice.
Brandon: And the same thing happens to Tuna. And I think as the warmth races up from their toes, their eyes also change the same color into this like emerald green.
Amanda: Both you and Tun?
Brandon: Both me and Tun! And so that means also for Halo of Spirits, on a reaction, I get to deal now 6 necrotic damage automatically. Anyway, back to my actual movement. I'm going to say,
Eric [as Tuna]: Tuna! Tuna, alright. You. Me. You. Me. Let's go.
Brandon: And I'm going to crawl on the floor behind Tuna as Tuna tries to go towards, let's say, the jetpack guy and attack this bad guy who … I forgot their name.
Eric: This is Fresh
Brandon: Fresh. They’re not going to be so fresh after I attack ‘em huh?
Eric: Nice!
Brandon: Got ‘em. So I'm gonna use my d20 to roll a spell attack.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: 18 + 5 for 23.
Julia and Amanda: Yeah!
Amanda: We love 8s and 18s here.
Brandon: So that means I get 1d8 plus 1d6 necrotic damage.
Julia: Sick.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: Okay, so I rolled a 6 total plus 5 of my spell attack, so that's 11 damage.
Julia: Damn.
Eric: Alright. So you run over to this guy in a jetpack. And what- how do you swing your cat on him?
Brandon: I think Tuna and I have practiced this many times in front of a mirror.
Amanda: You're not getting your deposit back on your place?
Brandon: Absolutely not.
Amanda: No.
Brandon: And so I started just like, hold Tun’as butt and then fling them up.
Eric: And then he goes [meows]
Brandon: Yeah. And then they claw the jetpack itself I think.
Eric: That's very good. Yeah [laughing] Tuna has these ghostly claws that are much longer than a cat should. And just out of nowhere this cat jumps on this person's face, claws at them, and like gets in the jetpack and the jetpack starts to malfunction.
And it goes [making jetpack failure noises] woowoowoo and he just slams into the wall and slumps down.
Brandon [as Milo]: Hell you Tuna!
Eric: Alright. Yeah! You took that dude down. This is now Crawdad’s turn.
Amanda: How is Crawdad not down?!
Eric: He- you’ve hurt him a lot! He has a shield so you’ve just been hitting him so much that he's trying to hold on this shield as much as possible.
[Amanda sighs]
Eric: He uses action to disengage and he runs over and grabs- there's a sign. I want all three of you to make a Perception check.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 11.
Julia: That’s a 2… wait sorry it’s an 18.
Brandon: 21.
Amanda: Oh.
Brandon: How did you…?
Eric: I mean, it’s fine because one of you rolled really well.
Julia: I'm so confused. It's an 18.
Eric: Alright. It's 18. So, Val and Milo, you see that Crawdad disengages, runs away and grabs the sign. And on this sign, it's like his old style sign for an ice cream store.
Amanda: Wow!
Eric: And he grabs it starts to run away with it.
[Amanda gasps]
Eric: So he's now running around trying to like run around everybody and using all of his speed to do kind of like an end run to get to the emergency exit that Aggie had used before.
Brandon: Seems efficient.
Eric: It is now Val’s turn.
Julia: Can I still hit him with my speed of 30? Can I get him?
Eric: If you run over to him, you can hit him.
Julia: So, yeah, I'm going to Reckless Attack him.
Amanda: Woo!
Julia: So I get Advantage on a melee weapon attack.
Eric: Hell yeah.
[dice rolling]
Julia: Glad I did that.
[dice rolling]
Julia: Alright. That's still not great. It is 8 + 5, which is 13 plus an additional 2 because I'm raging. 15.
Eric: Yeah. 15 hits exactly, yes.
Amanda: Hey!
Julia: Awesome.
Eric: So Crawdad…
Julia: Boom. So that is a 6 + 5. So that's 11.
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: Then I'm going to use my Battle Rager Armor as my bonus action.
Amanda: Yeah!
Julia: Which means I now get to deal 1d4 plus my strength modifier.
Eric: Hell yeah dude.
Amanda: Fuck yeah.
Julia: Alright. That's a 1 but it’s plus 3.
Eric: How do you take him down? Crawdad’s running with this wooden sign that he’s holding.
Eric [as Crawdad]: I got it! I got it!
Julia: Val just barrels into him like a football player.
[all cheering]
Julia: Just like as they're coming down together, just brings the bag down and whacks him in the head with it.
Brandon and Amanda: Yeah!
Eric: That's amazing. I want you to make a Dexterity saving throw.
Julia: Okay, not that great at this. Hold on.
[dice rolling]
Julia: Alright. It's an 11 plus 1, so at 12.
Eric: [sighs] Oh, with a 12…Okay. The sign kind of falls over with a thud. Luckily, you did not hurt the sign.
Julia: Oh thank god.
Eric: The sign is fine. The sign is fine.
Julia: The city's not going to sue me for a bunch of money.
Eric: That’s true.
Amanda: More importantly, mom won’t send her grandsons after you.
Eric: Yeah, that would be bad. Alright. We are coming back around to Aggie. You are standing near the front. Yabbie has –
Amanda: Yabbie’s –
Eric: - Run down the hallway.
Amanda: Got it.
Eric: But Mud Bug is the one who you're scrapping with.
Amanda: Okay, so now that two of the three in this room are down, I feel okay leaving. So I am going to run down the other fork of the hallway to try to catch Yabbie.
Eric: Okay, Mud Bug’s going to make an Opportunity attack against you.
[dice rolling]
Eric: 17.
Amanda: Yeah that hits.
Eric: Okay.
[dice rolling]
Eric: That is a 6 points of damage.
Amanda: Okay.
Julia: Doing okay over there?
Amanda: That's twelve.
Julia: Oh, that's not great.
Amanda: You know me.
Eric: So you going to run down the hall, Aggie?
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Cool. Make an Investigation check.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 17 + 2.
Eric: Okay, 19. Yeah, you see over the vault, this is down a longer hallway, but now Yabby is set with some sort of computer with a bunch of wires plugged into the vault and is like tapping on the computer being like,
Eric [as Yabby]: Come on, come on, let's go. Come on.
Amanda: I'm going to attack the computer. I'm going to attempt to stab the computer.
Julia: Ooh!
Eric: You are too far away to do an melee attack. But if you want to throw something at the computer-
Brandon: [chanting] Throw the spear!
Julia: [joining in] Throw the spear!
Amanda: Yeah, let's do it. Throw the spear.
Eric: Alright. So just use the same stats. But now it's a ranged attack.
Amanda: Alright, so I have 10 + 5 to hit.
Eric: [sighs] with a 15… What is a computer's AC?
Brandon: Less than 15!
Amanda: Less than 15!
Eric: So the AC for 15 is bone, like something made out of bone or wood.
Amanda: A computer is less hard than a bone!
Eric: I would say that it's more – it’s definitely more damage than bone. Uh, it’s HP is 10. So you have to do 10 points of damage to break the computer.
Julia: You got this.
Amanda: [whispers] Okay.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: No, that's a 1 + 3 for 4.
Eric: I think it's definitely distracting, and Yabbie’s like,
Eric [as Yabby]: Oh- oh shit!
Eric: And hitting it. I also want you to think about what it looks like for someone to be hunched over a computer while wearing a shrimp mask.
[all giggle]
Amanda: It's very funny. And so is the spear that went clear through the screen. I think the whole right side of the screen - just can't see things there.
Eric: That’s definitely- I'll- I'll take that. I'll take that. So he'll have more trouble doing his next roll. So this is now Shield boy. The Wing boy is down. So this is now just Mud Bug by himself. I think Mud Bug is going to disengage and go over and grab the sign. And I'm gonna role for athletics, for Dash.
Amanda: Val gets an Opportunity Attack, right?
Eric: Oh, you get the Opportunity Attack against them.
[dice rolling]
Julia: It’s a 15 + 3 so 18.
Eric: Okay, that hits.
Julia: Cool. That’s a 6 + 4 so that’s a 10 and I’m gonna do Battle Armor too.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: And that’s an additional 2 plus additional 3. So it’s 15 damage.
Amanda: Hey!
Eric: [laughing] Oh my god. This guy tries to run past you, and he tries to hold his shield up and you still body check him like you're a hockey player. Yeah, you do the damage, but he still leans down, scoops up the sign and he's going to use his action to Dash and he's like at the emergency exit.
Julia: That’s fine. I’ll take that.
Amanda: As he leaves Val’s reach, do they also get an Opportunity Attack?
Eric: Uh, no. Val gets one Opportunity Attack.
Julia: That’s fine. I’ll deal with it.
Eric: Yeah. This is now Yabby’s turn, the inventor, and he is going to have a harder time to do the things he's going to try to do.
[dice rolling]
Eric: Yeah. He slams on his computer a little. He's like,
Eric [as Yabby]: [hurried] Come on, come on.
Eric: And he hits in the code. He hits enter and the wires are attached to the door. And is it just kind of goes “ca-chunk!” and thje vault door swings open and he’s like,
Eric [as Yabby]: Yus!
Eric: And he runs inside. And he is now outside of your field of vision from the outside of the vault.
Julia: Get ‘em, Aggie. Get ‘em.
Amanda: To my knowledge, there is no back exit to a vault, so hopefully I can still get him on the way out.
[all laughing]
Julia: Good point.
Eric: That is 100% true. It is now Milo’s turn.
Brandon: Okay. Milo and Tuna are doing the secret handshake they do when they have a successful um…
Eric: Just paws everywhere.
Brandon [as Milo]: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We are the best! Yes!
Brandon: And then from sort of the center of his body, Milo feels all the warmth, sort of like collect. And then Milo’s like,
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Here we go.
Brandon: And then from out of his body, you sort of see like the shadow of another person's body exit his body and then sort of dissolve. And I'm gonna cast Entangle towards Mud Bug and grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground and a 20 foot square starting from a point within range - For the duration, these plants turn the ground into an area with difficult terrain. A creature in the area, when I cast a spell, must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants until the spell ends.
Eric: What am I trying to beat?
Brandon: My Spell Save DC is 13.
[dice rolling]
Eric: I rolled 8, so I done done fucked up.
Brandon: Yeah!
Eric: So what- what happens to Mud Bug?
Brandon: So Mud Bug is entangled in these like grasping thorny vines and weeds that come from the ground.
Eric [as Mud Bug]: How is this in – we’re in a bank! This doesn’t make any sense!
Brandon [as Milo]: I'm sorry! I didn’t know it was gonna - Okay. I'm sorry!
Eric [as Mud Bug]: Ugh! God!
Brandon: I don't think you - I think I'll be Okay!
Julia: He’s restrained?
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Alright, cool.
Amanda: Yeah!
Brandon: And you can do it - On every turn, you can use your action to make a Strength check against my spell save DC and if you succeed, you can free yourself.
Eric: Great.
[dice rolling]
Eric: I was just doing a roll to see if some other guys stood up, but they were very down at the moment. So yeah, now we're going to do Milo's feet. Milo has kind of a Wild Magic situation. We- I gave Milo +1 to one of his stats, and he also has a wild magic table. So we're going to use a house rule that - we call it Spirit Surge.
So ordinarily you would just roll a 1 on a wild magic roll. But if Brandon does not roll a 1 on this, which invokes the Spirit Surge table and then something wild happens, it's going to stack so then later it's going to be 1, 2, and then 1, 2, 3.
Amanda: I see.
Eric: Alright, so roll d20 and if you get a 1, you get a Spirit Surge.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: 13!
Eric: That is not a 1. Alright, you’re still good. Next time you're gonna roll and it's gonna be 1 or a 2. Alright. This is now Val’s turn.
Julia: So Val just watched a dude get wrapped up in vines.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: That they were wailing on two minutes ago, so –
Amanda: Welcome to Lake Town City, baby.
Julia: But Val is also in a rage, so Val does not care and Val is just gonna bring the heavy bag down on this dude again.
[dice rolling]
Julia: Okay, it’s a 15 + 5 so it’s a non-natural 20.
Eric: Hot damn. Yeah. You got him.
Julia: Alright. And then I'm going to also use the Battle Ranger Armor with my attack, so that’s a 3 plus 5, so that’s an 8 plus 4 plus 2, which is 6 so 14 damage.
Amanda: Dang.
Julia: 11, so not going to add the battle armor.
Eric: That one does not hit.
Julia: Okay, but he's still taking 8 points of damage.
Eric: Great. Alright. Yeah. Just hit Mud Bug with the suitcase – he’s like,
Eric [as Mud Bug]: Why is all of this happening?
Julia [as Val]: Why are you trying to steal shit?
Eric [as Mud Bug]: Oh, reasons. We all used to steal things. I have reasons. I have important reasons!
Julia [as Val]: Listen, we all steal things from time to time. But like, you know -
Eric [as Mud Bug]: No you don’t know - No, you can't - you can't relate to me. No, I don't like that at all.
Eric: Alright. Aggie, it is your turn.
Amanda: Alright, I'm going to run forward into the vault and try to take this guy down.
Eric: Alright.
Amanda: 13 + 5 to hit.
Eric: Yeah, that hits.
Amanda: And I am going to pick up my spear from where it laid in the computer, like I grab my spear on my way in and spear him again.
[Eric chuckling]
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 1 + 3 for 4 damage. Ouch. But gonna take my unarmed strike as well.
Eric [as Yabby]: No I’m bookish! Don't hurt me!
[Brandon laughs]
Eric [as Yabby]: I’m the computer guy!
Amanda: And punch him in his face.
Eric [as Yabby]: No, I'm the computer guy!
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 11 to hit.
Eric: That one does not hit. I think you were too busy trying to punch him in the face – you concentrated too much on it.
Amanda: Well, I’m gonna go ahead and use another Key Point.
Julia: Dang!
[Brandon laughing]
Amanda: 12 + 5.
Eric: That one hits.
Amanda: Great, then-
Eric [as Yabby]: No, you wouldn’t hit a guy with glasses would you?
Amanda: 3 + 3 fopr 6 points of damage additional.
Eric [as Yabby]: Ouch. Why?
Eric: Yeah, he’s looking bad. This is the bookish one. You are just hurting him so much.
Amanda: Good.
Eric: Yabby says,
Eric [as Yabby]: Hey, hey, we're in the vault. You - just take some of this stuff. Look, there's gold and cash everywhere. Just take that! You don’t have to beat me up. Just take it!
Amanda [as Aggie]: Why are you even here?
Eric [as Yabby]: Just - reasons. I have reasons!
Amanda [as Aggie]: So I have reasons for stopping you.
Eric [as Yabby]: Yeah, so just take the cash and go. Why are you stop- ? Are you the police? Are you police?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Kind of!
Eric [as Yabby]: No you’re not. You’re not police. If you had a badge, you'd be police. If you were police, and I ask you, you have to tell me or it’s entrapment. I learned that on Reddit.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Listen, in an ideal society, police are here to put to protect people. And I am here explicitly to protect this town. So, you know, my word is law.
Eric [as Yabby]: Okay. I mean, you could just - just take the… Okay, fine. But look just take the cash. You can be a dirty cop. You wanna be cop, just take the money and be a dirty cop.
Amanda [as Aggie]: What do you want it for? Can I - can I help you, what do you need?
Eric [as Yabby]: For stuff! I don’t have to tell you, you're not my mom.
Amanda [as Aggie]: People lash out when they are hurt. Can I help you?
Eric [as Yabby]: No. You hurt me! That was you doing the hurting!
[all laughing]
Julia: He got you there.
Eric: Sick. Alright. I want the two people in the auction area to make Perception checks.
Julia: I’ll make some Perpception.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: I’m gonna perceive it up. I got 14 total.
Eric: Hot damn.
Julia: That’s a 3.
Amanda: Aw!
Eric: Oh, no. Milo, you hear the revving of a motorcycle engine and it's loud.
Brandon: Is it coming towards me, or…?
Eric: It is coming – first it's low, but it's coming slowly towards you.
Brandon: Oh no.
Eric: And you hear vroooom! And clunk clunk clunk up the stairs. It takes a hard right, and it's coming right towards the auction area.
Brandon: Oh god…
Eric: And you see that there is a hunched over like a Tron-style motorbike is a figure dressed all in black with a chrome motorcycle helmet, what kind of looks like shoulder pads. And it's like they've been sanded down, so they're a little more sleek and they've been painted chrome with chrome spray paint, and holding a reflective mirror shield. Just this person leaning over this thing and just deftly maneuvering the motorcycle down this hallway. They skid by you and say,
Eric [as motorcycle figure]: Citizen, is everything okay? What seems to be the problem?
[music fades]
Amanda: Hey, it’s Amanda. I am more grateful than ever these days for the little things, especially the small beautiful stuff I use every day.

[action music begins]
Brandon [as Milo]: Um…No, everything is not okay. First of all, who are you? Second of all, there's some people trying to steal some stuff and I tried to stop them and I did stop one of them, and I think that something that’s huge and wearing some sort of spike also top one. And there was some sort of like large “ca-clunk!” over in that direction. I don't know exactly what's happening. This is not my cat. I don't know where they came from either.
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: What cat?
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, right. Yeah. I don't know. Sorry. I don't know why I said that. That's funny. Oh, my God.
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: Alright. Who's the bad guy? Point me in the direction of the bad guy.
Brandon [as Milo]: There's one trapped in vines right there and there's one towards the vault. And there were four total. I don't know… I don't know exactly where the other ones are.
Amanda: Laying around groaning like shrimp that they are.
Julia: The dudes in the shrimp masks also.
Brandon [as Milo]: Also who are you, maybe? Maybe tell me who you are.
Eric: They speed away.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, bye!
Eric: And they pull out what kind of looks like a billy club. And on their motorcycle like drives through the grasping vines, and just smacks Mud Bug.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, wow. I didn't know you were gonna do that. Oh my god.
Eric: And they take a bunch o’ damage.
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric: Like everything is moving. It's like even when they stopped a little bit to talk to you, it still was like moving a little bit. And they were doing like rings around you to keep momentum.
Amanda: Aw.
Eric: And they sped and just something smack-smacked Mud Bug. And are like just keeping survey and riding around.
Julia: Is Mud Bug still up?
Eric: He looks pretty fucked up, but he's like,
Eric [as Mud Bug]: Why is all this happening?! Are you all police?! Why is everyone police?!
Eric: It is now Yabby’s turn. And Yabby says,
Eric [as Yabby]: Hey, I - one chance. Just let me go. I got stuff. You don't know people I know. One last chance. Let me go.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Tell me why you're here.
Eric [as Yabby]: We need the cash. We want the stuff.
Julia [as Val]: You need to use nouns that aren't “stuff.”
Eric [as Yabby]: We want the cash for our endeavors, and that's our sign. So we're taking it back.
Amanda [as Aggie]: What sign?
Eric [as Yabby]: The ice cream shop sign, that's ours.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Are you from Ma’s? I'm sorry to hear about your financial troubles.
Eric [as Yabby]: Yeah, well, what how do you know things like that?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Man, I'm just just plugged into the network, man. If you have problems, I can help you, come on!
Eric [as Yabby]: You don't know. You're not from Historic Lake Town! You don't know that stuff. You don't know us! You're just a fancy person hanging out downtown. This is our shit.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Did you not hear? I’m O’Hare, of the Lake Town O’Hares.
Eric [as Yabby]: O’Hare… Oh, the custodian? Oh, yeah. What are you been doing? You've been doing things down at the museum? You’ve been giving tours. Yeah. I see all the help you've been doing with the city government. Thanks for that.
Amanda: I make a fist and rear back.
Eric: Alright. So…
[dice rolling]
Eric: He reaches into the bag and he pulls out a jar of looks like little mechanical hornets.
Amanda: Delicious.
Eric: Just like bouncing around in there looking angry, and he throws it at your face. I'm going to make an attack roll.
Brandon: Don't eat them, that’s bad.
Eric: Okay, he misses you, but I'm going to make a roll to see if the jar explodes.
[dice rolling]
Eric: Oooo! Uh oh! Yeah, so he throws the jar of these like robotic wasps at you, and the jar breaks. And now there's just like these mechanical wasps that are angrily flying everywhere.
Amanda: Listen, we have black fly season two months a year. I'm used to this. This is fine. But can I roll either Investigation or History and see if I know this person?
Eric: Sure. What don’t you make a History check?
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 14.
Eric: Even with a 14, I would say the fact that he doesn't have a lot of stuff on him because he has been outfitted for the bank robbery, and he does have the mask on, but he already revealed to you that he is associated with Ma’s and he is from Lake Town. And he knows who you are.
Amanda: Right.
Eric: If he knows who you are enough that he has an opinion about you, that kind of narrows the pool pretty nicely.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: All that happens that the wasps are now out and about. I’m going to roll Initiative for the wasps.
[dice rolling]
Eric: The wasps are gonna attack last.
Amanda: Aw.
Eric: Because the wasps are slow and confused. While the wasps are distracting you, he tries to shove more cash and gold into his bag. It is now Milo's turn again.
Brandon: What's the status on everyone?
Eric: Two of them are down. Mud Bug is stuck, and Val and this person on the motorcycle is on there.
Brandon: Okay, so at this point, Milo is, let's say, overwhelmed.
Eric: Sure.
Brandon: And so I think I start feeling that same feeling of the warmth in my body, sort of like congeal into one spot. And I think Tuna looks at me because they're feeling the same thing. And we close our eyes because we know it's about to happen. And we cast Thunder Wave.
Eric: Oh, no!
Brandon: Which is a wave of thunderous force sweeps out from under me. Each creature within a 50 foot cube originating must make a Constitution saving throw.
Eric: Alright. So that is going to be both Mud Bug and Val and the motorcycle person.
Julia: Great.
[dice rolling]
Julia: Oh! Nat-20!
Eric: Whoa!
Brandon: Nice.
Eric: Both the people I’m controlling take full damage.
Brandon: Okay, so if you've got a successful save, Julia, you take half damage and you aren’t pushed down.
Julia: Nice.
Brandon: Anyone who doesn't takes full damage and unsecured objects are pushed 10 feet away.
Julia: Oh sweet.
Brandon: And also an audible thunderous boom extends 300 feet.
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: Citizen, what are you doing? What is that?
[dice rolling]
Brandon: So I rolled 9 damage for everyone.
Eric: Alright.
Julia: So I take half of that, so it’s 4.
Brandon: Yeah, then Milo says
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I did not mean to, well, I mean, like not necessarily a bad thing if that stops everyone else but like, hey, person spike jacket? You cool?
Julia: Eh.
Brandon [as Milo]: Great. Robocop –
Brandon: Is Robocop on the ground?
Eric: They had to make a roll to stay on the motorcycle. Yeah, they're good. Alright. Yeah. [laughing] So this thunder wave like reverberates from your body, and knocks all of these people backwards. Mud Bug is just- there's a lot of stuff happening to him today, but he is looking very bad. But he is not down. And the motorcycle like hops like 5 feet, but they still maneuver themselves. So they're on the bike and the bike like throws its kickstand down to like hold him down.
Brandon: Gotcha.
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: That was irresponsible.
Brandon [as Milo]: I'm sorry. I don't know.
Brandon: And if you were to listen closely at the boom, at the very tail end, you can hear a little ghostly whispers.
Eric: It goes like psspsspss. I like that you do this. It goes [whispering noises] pspspsps. Roll for your surge my man.
Amanda: It's like a thunderclap with a little secret at the end.
Julia: Don't like that.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: That's a 7.
Eric: Alright, you're fine. So that's going to go up to three next time. It is now Mud Bug’s turn. They rolled a nat-20.
Julia: Oh nice.
Eric: So they broke free of the grasping vines and they just book it. They immediately kick the emergency exit out. So they're going to run- run out the door and start running out into the street with the sign under their arm. And they take out a walkie talkie and go,
Eric [as Mud Bug]: Go! Let’s get out of here. We got it! Go, go, go, go!
Brandon [as Milo]: Um, are you seeing this, new friend?!
Julia [as Val]: I got it.
Eric: Okay, Val, it’s now your turn.
Julia [as Val]: I’m gonna chase them.
Eric: So you're just going to chase them and take them down?
Julia: Yeah. If I had to pay for my stuff, they have to pay for their stuff. So that’s a 12 + 5. 17
Eric: Yeah, that does – that’s hit.
Julia: Alright. That is 6 + 4. 10. And I’m gonna take that bonus action.
Eric: Okay, so what does it look like when you take Mud Bug- he's had a time. All of these people have had a time.
Amanda: They incited this crime. We were having an ice auction for charity.
Julia: Again, I think it's one of these things where Val is vibrating, where they just look out of focus when you look at them right. And I imagine that Mud Bug, gets all the way down the stairs to the street, and Val just launches themself off of the top step and curls into them.
Eric: [laughing] You just spear yourself?
Julia: Yeah, just spear.
Eric: Oh no.
Brandon: Is Tuna impressed by this?
Eric: Tuna’s like,
Eric [as Tuna]: I mean, best day I’ve had in a while. This is amazing. This is so much better than the dumb stuff you put on TV.
Brandon [as Milo]: Wow. Rude. You wanna do this now?
Eric [as Tuna]: We’re going to watch Star Trek again?
Brandon [as Milo]: We're gonna do this now? Here right now?
Eric [as Tuna]: I will.
[meows
Eric: And then Tuna flops in the air and exposes their belly.
Julia: Val just picks up the sign and is like,
Julia [as Val]: Hell yeah.
Eric: I got it. It is now the wasps’ turn, and the wasps are going to attack everything in the area. So they're gonna attack Aggie.
[dice rolls]
Eric: That is a 22.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: That's gonna be… [whispers] 44…
Julia: 44?
Eric: You get 8 points of damage from the wasps.
Amanda: Oh. Down to 4.
Julia: That’s bad.
[dice rolling]
Eric: The wasps are still hanging out. It is so overwhelming.
Amanda: Aggie is going to retreat out of the vault and then slam the door closed.
Eric: Ooh, okay.
Julia: I like that choice.
Eric: How do you want to get out of there?
Amanda: Yeah, Aggie’s going to do a back handspring.
Eric: [laughs] Yeah. Do it.
Amanda: 13 + 3 for 16.
Eric: Okay, 16, you're able to avoid the wasps and you do a back handspring out of the vault.
Amanda: One of Aggie siblings is an Olympic swimmer, so lots of time in athletic centers.
Eric: Sure, sure, sure.
Amanda: And I'm going to swing the door closed.
Eric: Yeah. Make a strength roll, or athletics roll.
Brandon: God, can you imagine the poor curator that’s gonna open this vault?
Amanda: Well that’s only a 5.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: Okay, door won't close, but I could still punch the attacker in the face through the gap.
[everyone laughs]
Amanda: So I’m gonna use my last Key Point.
Julia: Fair and valid.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: Doors can’t hold back fists.
Amanda: Alright, 4 + 5 does not hit probably. 3 + 5. Both don’t hit?
Eric: Geez, no.
Julia: You’re like a cat trying to like through a door.
Eric: It's because there are wasps there and the wasps are just like, hey, don't - don't mess around.
Amanda: Very well. Alright. I'm still going to stay outside the door, so if this person tries to escape, they do have to run past me.
Eric: Alright, it is the motorcycle person’s turn, and they rev up their motorcycle and are gonna go speed down towards the vault. Aggie, you see a person on a motorcycle with a chrome helmet just going full speed at you.
Amanda: So the door didn't move? The door is still open?
Eric: The door is still open, yeah.
Amanda: I put my back against the wall and stand aside.
Eric: Okay, they can't get into the vault yet, but I like the idea that you just look it up and then it's like screeeeee!
Amanda [as Aggie]: Hi there. I need some help disarming this person. You look like a good guy?
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: Citizen, where's the bad guy?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Right inside.
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: Alright. Why are there wasps in here?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Don't worry about it. Looks like you have a helmet.
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: I hate it.
Eric: Alright. Let’s see… [dice rolling]
Julia: Probably not actually a robot if they dislike wasps, that’s all I’m sayin’.
Amanda: Hmm!
Eric: Alright. Yabbie is going to do…
[dice rolling]
Julia: Who would've thought Yabbie would have been the hardest person to take down?
Amanda: Not I.
Eric: This guy’s put in a real pickle here. I think he's going to try to run. And I think that both the motorcycle person and Aggie are gonna - I don't know what else to do.
Julia: No, that makes sense.
Amanda: I got a 21 to hit.
Eric: Yeah. Do damage.
Amanda: Alright. Try to strike him with my spear. I got an 8 plus 3 for an 11.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Fuckin’ finally!
Julia: Got it down.
Eric: So he’s – he looks around and is like,
Eric [as Yabby]: Oh no!
Eric: With his bag of everything on his shoulder. He tries to run through, puts his hands up to block the wasps, and you just like smack him in the face with your spear.
Amanda: Just to knock him out. Just to knock him out.
Eric: Okay. All the bank robbers are down.
Brandon: Yay!
[all cheer]
Eric: You did it! So we are now out of initiative. [music stops]
So, yeah, everybody's down. All of the people around are very confused and overwhelmed by what's happening. The person on the motorcycle turns to Aggie and says,
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: Hey, great shot.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Uh, no offense, but I haven’t seen you around. Who are you?
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: Um…I am the defender of Lake Town City.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Here we go…
Eric [as motorcycle robot]: When they need me - when they need me, I'm there. I reflect what society does back onto them. It's to show that they're better than they are. I am the Knight of Mirrors.
Julia: With a K?
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Cool.
Julia: Just checkin’
Eric: Screeeeee! And they peel out of their tron motorcycle –
Amanda [as Aggie]: Come visit me at the museum caretaker's cottage!
[Eric making motorcycle revving noises]
Eric: And the motorcycle drives – clunkclunkclunk down the stairs and peels away down the street.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Well, that was disorienting.
Amanda: And I walked toward the lobby to find some kind of police presence, hopefully.
Eric: And then the police show up. They're all going [imitates siren] bah bah bah weeooweeoo! And the police are there.
Amanda [as Aggie]: I want to make sure they can secure all the valuables. But then I do, of course, want to go back to the auditorium to check on how stuff is going.
Julia: Val’s just walking back inside with the big Ma’s sign.
Eric: Yeah, I would ask all three of you - do you want to be there when the police show up?
Julia: I just want my fucking chair.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Someone take this damn bag off me, I just want my chair!
Amanda: Yeah, because you two have to finish your stuff, and I - I'm going to stick around until everything's resolved. I have to figure what happened.
Brandon: I turned to Tuna and I say,
Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna, shit's weird enough already. Go away for a little bit.
Eric [as Tuna]: Well, you know, here's the thing about being invisible is that I can kind of just like peace out.
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah but the eyes! Look at the eyes!
Eric [as Tuna]: No, I know. They just think you have cool green eyes. Which is weird, though, is people did see a ghost come out of your body.
Brandon [as Milo]: [pained] Mmmmmm…
Eric [as Tuna]: I was hoping you would disguise that in some way, but it turns out you did not.
Brandon [as Milo]: Shit.
Eric [as Tuna]: Bye!
Eric: He jumps away
Brandon: And then I walk out from behind the rows of chairs with my hands up.
Eric: I'm gonna say make a stealth roll. I want to see how many people saw the literal ghost come out of your body.
Julia: Can I roll Perception? Because I'm pretty sure I saw it.
Eric: Aggie, make a Perception check as well to see if you saw that.
[dice rolling]
Julia: That’s a 19.
Amanda: Damn, an 8. I mean, I wasn't there, to be fair.
Julia: I love the idea of Milo raising his hands as Val’s walking back into the room and they're just like,
Julia [as Val]: Come on dude, be cool.
Brandon: Yeah, I got a 4.
Eric: Apparently everyone saw it, including Aggie.
Brandon: Wait, who's in this room, though? Because like wouldn’t people have cleared out.
Eric: I think a lot of people did get blinded by the flash bang and they are regular people. But I will say that like with a 4, people saw who you didn't want to. So I think that, like, there are some people around who are able to - because it was just they were all con saves, right? So theoretically it was a 10 if it's a 50 percent chance some people were not blinded by the flashbang.
So people did see this happen because you did not hide it at all, including Val and Aggie and the motorcycle person.
Amanda: Yeah, maybe Aggie caught the like vestiges of the swamp disappearing or something.
Brandon: Hmm…
Eric: Yeah. Maybe like as returns inside of you.
Brandon: I think, then, it's time for Milo to - to bail out. I have this thing called “Pass Without Trace,”, wear a veil of shadows and silence radiates from me, masking me and my companions from detection. Each creature within 30 feet of me has plus 10 bonus to Stealth checks and can't be tracked.
Eric: Nice, that’s a spell right?
Brandon: That’s a spell. So as Tuna makes Milo this very valid point, Milo’s like,
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh… shit.
Brandon: And then the warmth starts from his head this time and descends down just to his toes. And as it falls down, he becomes invisible.
Eric: Please make your – your surge roll for me.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: [laughs] I got a 1.
[all cheering]
Eric: Let’s go!
Amanda: Yes!
Brandon: I still gotta make a Stealth check to leave the room, too.
Eric: Okay, so make the Stealth check to leave the room then.
Brandon: Okay, that’s a 29 total.
Amanda: Ooh! Stealthiest lad in the land.
Brandon: This hasn't happened before - this exact thing, so he like assumes he can't be seen, but just in case he is like stealthily back against the wall. Just taking step by step out of the room.
[dice rolling]
[Eric laughing]
Julia: Uh oh.
Amanda: Oh, no. The worst sound in the world.
Eric: Aw shit, okay.
[dice rolling]
Eric: Make a Wisdom saving throw..
[dice rolling]
Brandon: 12 plus 5 for 17.
Eric: What is your DC?
Brandon: 13.
Eric: Alright, 13. Okay.
[suspenseful music starts]
Here’s what happens. You cast like- you then become just a shadow, right, and as you're walking - you're trying to walk out. But the center of your body where all of these spirits come out of, it's - it seems like it's unstable. You feel - you think the warmth is going through your whole body, but it stays right in your center, and you're - it's strange and uncomfortable.
Tuna comes back for a second and says,
Eric [as Tuna]: Hey, are we getting out? What do we do? Are we getting out of here?
Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna, did I forget to take my Lactaid today? Please tell me I didn’t forget to take my Lactaid today.
Eric: And then there is like a shadowy hand that reaches out from the middle, which only you and Tuna can see because you have your shadow.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh my god. This is not good. Oh my god.
Eric: This shadowy hand reaches out and points its finger in like a gun motion at Tuna.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh shit.
Eric: And shoots it like with a paintball. And it's like a paintball of shadow. And it explodes and envelops Tuna. Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna!
Eric: And tuna in front of your eyes, transforms into a panther.
Brandon: Oh!
Eric: And now everyone can see Tuna. And because people are running around like ahhhh! Screaming and running away from this panther, including both Aggie and Val. Tuna, or the panther that was formerly Tuna is freaking out and just bats things around, dives at people. Val, Aggie, what do you do?
Julia: I’m gonna grapple the panther.
Eric: You’re gonna grapple Tuna? Grapple the panther.
Julia: Alright, it’s an 8 + 5 so 13. Give me those panther stats.
Eric: I'm know, I’m looking up panther stats.
Amanda: I'm wearing like a pen shaped necklace. And I'm going to yank the pen out of the chain and send a little blow dart at the panther to try to sedate it.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 17 to hit.
Eric: Alright. I rolled a 14.
Julia: Damnit!
Eric: So 14, you try to grapple the panther, so he just bucks you off is prowling around. I think you shoot it with the dart,
Amanda: 5.
Eric: With 5 damage. You assume that it was something would happen, but it just ignores it and it prowls around the room. Do you want to try to put it away?
Brandon: Yeah, I'm going to try to dash over to my new panther buddy and make them a shadow with me.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: I got 16.
Eric: [giggling] You got a 16?. I got a 17.
Brandon: Oh my god.
Eric: In all the commotion, you try to go over there and touch the panther, but the panther is overwhelmed by whatever shadow created it and avoids your touch and bounds at a –
Brandon [as Milo]: [sternly] Tuna! Get here now!
Eric: And bounds into the bank and roars at everyone and bounds away.
Julia: Val is like,
Julia [as Val]: What is happening?
Brandon: The familiar does disappear after a number of hours equal to half my Druid level. So after an hour and a half they will disappear.
Eric: Okay.
Julia [as Val]: Is this what all auctions are like?
Amanda [as Aggie]: No.
Julia [as Val]: There's not just panthers and like dudes in masks usually?
Eric [as random citizen]: Hey did everyone see that panther?
Julia [as Val]: There was a panther!
Amanda [as Aggie]: There was also a jetpack and a person on a motorcycle. And is that what they were trying to steal?
Amanda: And I point down to the sign.
Julia [as Val]: There was a dude who tried to take it out to the street. There was like two of them that wanted the sign. I don’t know what's going on.
Amanda [as Aggie]: But you got it back?
Julia [as Val]: Yes.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Thank you, citizen, for recovering this item.
Julia [as Val]: Please don't ever call me citizen again.
Amanda [as Aggie]: I’m sorry- I saw that cop on the motorcycle and it just really got into my head. I'm Aggie, by the way.
Julia [as Val]: Val.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Cool. Good to meet you.
Julia [as Val]: Cool. I'm supposed to have that chair. Can I get my chair and then go?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, you had the winning bid right? Yeah, of course.
Julia [as Val]: Cool. Alright. I need to find a bank guy who can get this off me.
Julia: And then holds up the –
Eric: It’s been attached to you the whole time.
Julia [as Val]: It's really complicated.
Eric: So, Val, you can go find these- the hookup.
Julia: Please.
Eric: You can do that, and then Aggie, you can talk - the police are kind of putting the mask people away if you want to try to talk to them or something.
Amanda: I think I'm more concerned with just the well-being of other people, like checking to see if anyone's injured. I don't think I would go and talk to the criminals now that the police have them.
Eric: Alright, cool. So they're putting them away. Now, Val, you're gonna go up to the auctioneer, and he's like,
Eric [as Auctioneer]: Aw, that was a real, real wild thing. [in auctioneer voice] There was, 1 enemy 2 enemy 3 enemy 4 enemy, that person on a motorcycle.
Julia [as Val]: Please sir-
Eric [as Auctioneer]: They go thirty thirty miles or 40 miles per hour and the panther had one claw, two claws-
Julia [as Val]: I just want to go home, please.
Eric [as Auctioneer]: Oh, yeah. Alright. Well, you can come back here and we're going to deal with the – deal with the payment.
Eric: And you go over to a room off the side. I like to think it's one of those doors that are the wall, but they just like kind of back –
Julia: Sure.
Eric: Back if you walk through –
Amanda: Man, who built this bank?
Eric: Sneaky bank.
Julia: The mob.
Eric: And he goes over a desk, rummages through it and pulls out a key.
Eric [as Auctioneer]: Is that - Is that it?
Julia [as Val]: Yes.
Eric: Alright. He puts the key in the handcuff lock and unlocks you. So, you now have your hand back.
Amanda: The key is to the handcuffs and not the briefcase.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: I also have to assume that I need to bring Dom back the rest of the money, so if you don't mind opening that and giving me my additional 250, that would be great.
Eric [as Auctioneer]: Okay, alright.
Eric: So he takes it. He goes over to the chair and he opens up –
Julia [as Val]: And a receipt of return, please.
Eric [as Auctioneer]: Yes. Absolutely. I will absolutely do that. Right. I'll write it down one time, two times, three times, four times…
Julia [as Val]: Sir, I really need to go home. It’s been a long night.
Eric: Here's a question. Do you want to look inside the bag?
Julia: I think I'm going to look when he opens it.
Eric: Okay, make an Investigation check. He is doing it surreptitiously, so I’m going to put a number in my head, which is a little higher than usual.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: 21.
Julia: No, it’s a 9.
Eric: Alright. With a 9, you do not see what's in there.
Julia: Alright.
Eric: So he takes out – it was in tens, so he takes out 25 bills and he puts a bag, and he puts a rubber band around it and he writes a note down. Yeah. You're fine. You can - you can - you have your arm back and you have your 250.
Julia [as Val]: And it's going to deliver the chair to Dom’s house?
Eric [as Auctioneer]: They’ll deliver the chair to Toretto house.
Julia: Alright.
Eric: Yeah. So you're fine.
Julia: Alright. I will go home.
Eric: What a - what a life. What a time. Aggie, the person running this whole thing comes up to you and says,
Eric [as auction director]: I - you know, this is the most fun I've had at one of these. Not saying a lot, but... you know thank – at least it was exciting. Thank you for coming. That was very nice. I know, we didn't… we'll have to postpone and we'll do this later. But you will get the money for the historic district. I know how important that is. Did you see anything that was missing? Did any - did they take anything? I know you were here the whole time.
Amanda [as Aggie]: I mean, someone attempted to rob the safe, but they didn't get away with anything. And as for all the items in here, it seems to me they're all accounted for. But I haven't done an inventory. You guys came with it, so-
Eric [as auction director]: Right, right, right.
Eric: Make an Investigation check.
[dice rolls]
Brandon: They are missing one panther.
Amanda: 8.
Eric: 8, yeah, seems to you that nothing was taken.
[Brandon bursts out laughing]
Julia: I don't like the way that was said.
Amanda: Not my job.
Eric: Not my job, not my problem. Not my job, not my problem.
Amanda: I understand why they were trying to steal the sign, but I don't see a reason to go into that level of detail.
Eric: That’s true. You get another email to your work address.
Julia: From the hot reporter.
Amanda: So I spend about half an hour wrapping everything up, give a statement to the police, and then finally, as I'm exiting and taking that breath of fresh air, finally check my phone.
Eric: Alright. You have another email and it's continued on the same chain from Tegan. Tegan says,
Eric [as Tegan]: Oh, wow. That- Pretty exciting. You know, it seems like you're more of a story than I thought. Let’s meet up tomorrow.
Amanda: And I reply, “Workin’ 9 to 5 at the museum, you know where to find me.”

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.

[tranquil electronic music]
[birds chirping]
Eric: It is fall in upstate New York, and there is a real sense of beginning. In other parts of the country, fall might feel like the slow decline into winter, but here, in the Adirondack mountains of New York State, it’s almost like a second birth. But this one, you know it’s coming. You are lighting the wick on that firework and waiting for it to blow, and that explosion is the wonderous colors of the leaves.
Before, so many people would pack up their cars full of camping supplies and snacks, and their whole family, and come up and peep at those leaves, but now, people are motoring upstate to see the City of the Future, Capital and Twin Jewel of New York State, Lake Town City.
Being so close to the forest at its south, the city is routinely covered in a blanket of vivid red, orange, and yellow leaves. No one can resist crunching a leaf underfoot.
The business-people smashing a big maple leaf with their wingtips in the Industrial District, the blue collar workers crunching their way into factory jobs in their steel-toed boots, or the families who are snap-snap-snapping on them as they run in their separate directions from suburban Weston out into the city.
You can see the students jump into piles in Collegetown, at SUNY Lake Town City, or the prestigious Morrow University, and the commuters blinking at the brilliant colors above as they stumble out of the high-speed train station that connects us to New York City. The tough guys skulking around Little Italy take a second from mean muggin' to watch the wonder of nature, and the hipsters on their fixed speed bicycles in Thorn Hill also take a second from mean muggin to watch the wonder of nature.
Some errant maple leaves flutter onto the water of the Historic Lake Town District, which used to be a signal of the end of the busy summer season only a few decades ago, but now, there’s no off season. And that is the first thought that surfaces into the mind of Dr. Cassandra Morrow, mayor of Lake Town City, local scientist, and its most famous resident. Well, you know, behind former Vice President, Al Gore [laughs].
She looks out the window of her town car whizzing through route 45, driven only by some disembodied mechanical hands and feet, and she says out loud,
Eric [as Dr. Morrow]: Hmm. There’s no off season anymore.
Eric: She sighs and adds on,
Eric [as Dr. Morrow]: Ugh thank God!
Eric: It’s morning on the first day of peak fall foliage in Lake Town City. Good morning, everybody.
[theme music]
Amanda: Good morning.
Julia: Good morning.
Brandon: Good morning!
Eric: Hello! I am your Dungeon Master, Eric Silver, and welcome to campaign 2 of Join the Party, Lake Town City. What a wonderful place it is!
Brandon: It sounds so nice. I want to crunch some leaves.
Julia: I want to close eyes and go there.
Amanda: Woo!
[all laugh]
Amanda: [singing] Lake Town Cit-ay!
Eric: [singing] Lake Town City! [speaking] Julia, this happens a lot. You’re just going to get used to it.
Julia: Alright!
Brandon: How’s the quality of the maple syrup in Lake Town City?
Amanda: Aw!
Eric: It’s good! Lake Town City is right on the border in between New York and Vermont which is separated by Lake Champlain. So literally if you look on Google Maps, it’s where Essex, New York is, which is kind of just a tiny town that means nothing, but if you want to look that up. So actually it’s very good, because they get it from Vermont, which is right there.
And also, you can also tell that Lake Town City is very close to Montreal, so it is really up there and it’s a real amalgam of cultures coming together, both of Upstate New York, of that kind of like upper ear of the United States. Like, it’s a very different type of New England up there. And then you have the Canadian influence from up there. And of course, it’s the City of the goddamn Future, coming together.
Brandon: That’s a very aggressive slogan for this town.
Eric: Well we do have this city’s slogan, it’s “Yesterday’s promise today.”
Julia: I also like that - the idea of Mayor Morrow just throwing in, just a big ol’ f bomb every once in a while.
Amanda: She’s too old to censor herself.
Brandon: That’s true.
Eric: For those of you that want to know, Dr. Cassandra Morrow - Cassandra is spelled like the Greek prophet and m-o-r-r-o-w like tomorrow.
Julia: Does she go by Mayor Morrow or Doctor Morrow?
Eric: She goes by Dr. Morrow, one hundred percent.
Amanda: Or Dr. Mayor Morrow I think.
Julia: [at the same time as Amanda] Dr. Mayor Morrow.
Brandon: Dr. Mayor Morrow?
Eric: She forces officials to call her Dr. Mayor Morrow, but she’s Dr. Morrow to most people.
Amanda: Okay. Everyone had to add like a second honorific slot when you sign up for online forms, because she will call customer service if it does not happen.
[laughter]
Eric: Listen, when she’s bored, she goes on the internet and she tries to get certified for being a priest, so she’s Justice of the Peace, Dr. Mayor Morrow [laughs]
Amanda: Reverend, attorney at law.
Eric: Reverend, esquire, Dr. Mayor Morrow.
Julia: If she’s the Big Bad, I’m gonna be really upset.
Eric: She’s the leader of the city! So I have no answer to that… [laughing]
[Amanda laughs]
Julia: My point stands.
Eric: Yes.
Brandon: Julia calling her shot in Episode One.
Julia: Oh no.
Eric: It’s true. Writing this down for later.
Amanda: I think the real villain is going to be capitalism.
Julia: It always is.
Eric: It’s always capitalism. Alright, uh, let’s introduce your characters. I’m going to roll a d4 and see who’s gonna go first.
[dice rolls]
[upbeat electric guitar melody plays]
Eric: As we zoom into the Historic Lake Town district, nestled in the top right corner of the city map, one of the many bungalows surrounding the original lake of Lake Town - which is actually an inlet which connects to Lake Champlain, I don't know if you knew that- we zoom in on Aggie, who is sleeping in her double bed with four blankets stacked on top of each other. And your alarm goes off at 8 in the morning.
[imitating alarm] beh-beh-beh-beh!
Amanda, would you like to introduce your character?
Amanda: Hello. My character is Aggie O’Hare. And she is the groundskeeper of the Historic Lake Town City Museum. It’s kind of like a living museum type of situation, where she has her like groundskeeper bungalow on the lake, but there is also a little museum in what used to be the boathouse, there are walking trails, there’s stuff for kids to look at.
It’s definitely a censored and sanitized version of the past of the city, but it’s Aggie’s home. And every morning she wakes up and does a little round along the grounds to make sure everything is okay, no kids breaking glass and making out and- things kids are doing in the dark in Lake Town City.
Eric: Do you do this before you wake up? Do you pull out a robe and a jacket over it and get in like a Jeep Wrangler and just like drive around?
Amanda: Uh, no I think I do a little visual sweep when I wake up. My bed is in a corner surrounded by windows, which is why it’s so cold you need all those quilts on top of you - to survey the grounds, get ready, do a little walkabout, and then come back for coffee, read the local paper, and you know, listen to the radio.
Eric: That’s true. Is anything strange happening in the Historic Lake Town District?
Amanda: Today everything is calm. It’s a beautiful morning, the trees are turning all around the lake, and when I go to the local newsstand-slash-deli-slash-bagel-shop-slash-bookstore to get my morning paper, I just do a normal little nod to the proprietress.
Eric: What’s the name of that place?
Amanda: It is named… Mountain News!
Eric: [chuckles] That’s true. From the top of the mountain to your ears!
Brandon: They’re great journalists, not very creative namers.
Eric: Well [laughs] Brandon, do you think there are reporters in there who are making the news?
Brandon: Uh-huh.
Eric: Actually that’s very-
Amanda: Oh no, no, no you’re right. Over the shop is the actual place where the paper is made.
Eric: I love that. So you walk in and Mickie is pouring coffee and slinging bagels, but she’s also like printing them out because she also writes the news- it’s just a newsletter.
[music stops]
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: It’s like a local newsletter. I really like that. And she’s like,
Eric [as Mickie]: Hey, uh Aggie? I don't know if you saw, but there were kids making out. And I definitely wrote down a whole piece - it’s in the Aggie Blotter.
Amanda [as Aggie]: You can’t just write things down that you see and like make it as if I was saying them, because it’s important to have some level of trust with the youth.
Eric [as Mickie]: No, no, no it’s like - it’s not like a police blotter where the police tell me. It’s like I’m telling the police. So it’s like I’m telling Aggie what happened so she can run that shit down. And everyone else thinks it’s funny so…
Amanda [as Aggie]: I… Is it… could you like email me maybe? Or send a text? Does it have to be… I see you every morning. You could just tell me and not, like, put it in the paper.
Eric [as Mickie]: Listen, print media’s not dead. You want the regular?
[all laugh]
Amanda [as Aggie]: Yes, please.
Eric: Alright, what’s your regular?
Amanda: It’s a medium coffee, light and sweet, a buttered roll, nothing else on it.
Eric: Fair.
Amanda: And a copy of the paper.
Eric: Alright, there you go. It’s all in a brown bag together, and Mickie gives it to you. And you can just cut to the front of the line because it’s already right there, and you have a tab going, and you can go about your merry way.
Amanda: Yeah, I take care of handyman tasks around the Mountain News shop in exchange for my morning goods.
Eric: That’s fair. I think at this point, the beeper you have in your back pocket goes off.
Amanda: Sure do.
Eric: And the thing about this beeper, it’s not just a 1980s beeper, it’s like a holographic beeper. It has all the basic stuff that you might have on like an iPhone 6, but it just kind of projects it in a hard light in front of you. So you have on your calendar that you need to make a presentation to the middle schoolers at North Country Secondary, and you have the charity auction tonight.
Amanda: Alright, better sit down at my table, collect myself for the day to come, feed my cat - their name is Sushi…
[all snicker]
Julia: Of course it is.
Amanda: … water all the plants, make sure the house is looking tidy. You never know who’s going to stop by to ask for something or pop in to say hello, so I gotta keep everything ship shape.
Eric: That’s fair. What to head in to work?
Amanda: Yeah, absolutely. So I can walk to the main museum building, which is where I normally spend my time. And that’s where we tend to receive visitors as well, if kids come in from the school, or tourist groups.
Eric: Great, so what does Aggie look like and what’s her usual fashion? What does she usually wear?
Amanda: Yeah, she is definitely Carhartt most of the way, or stuff from the Army-Navy store. So she does a lot of work with her hands, you know, outside a lot of the time, so it’s jeans and boots all year round, and the cut of the denim slash flannel shirt just varies based on the season. But today, a bit of a chill in the air, so she’s got just a work shirt, a heavy work shirt over her normal denim button-down.
Eric: Was it startling to Aggie when Carhartt started being popular?
Amanda: I don’t think she knows it’s popular.
[all laugh]
Eric: It’s like you're just seeing kids also wearing Carhartt and you’re like, “Aw nice I guess everyone’s really getting into woodworking now.” [laughs]
Amanda: Yeah, or you just assume their parents have passed along extremely new looking work clothes.
Eric: And it fits them so well, it’s wild.
Amanda: Yeah. I don't think she’s ever been to Thorn Hill. Aggie stays pretty close to home, so I don't know how much she’s exposed to these hipsters. I don’t even think she knows what hipsters are.
Eric: No. Definitely not. Alright, so Aggie, you’re walking over to the Historic Lake Town City Museum.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: To give some context here, so Historic Lake Town is truly historic. This was the neighborhood that was the original Lake Town that Lake Town City expanded from, and the government, both the United States Government, the New York State Government, and the government of Lake Town City really preserves this as a historic district, in some ways like historic Williamsburg, and in other ways, more like you know you walk around your city and it’s like, “Hey, did you know this place was like this in 1800?”
But there are government protections so there are only the original bungalows from ‘85 that surround the initial lake.
Amanda: And a good number of them are still owned by the people who I grew up with, because I grew up with a different bungalow on the other side of the lake.
Eric: Yeah, that’s true. You grew up in the bungalow that your parents used to have, but now they're out - I guess you’ve told me that they're out and about just retired and travelling?
Amanda: Oh yeah, I have six siblings and two parents, and they're all in different parts of North America and the world, just like living their lives and stuff.
Eric: Now, I did ask you to prepare what all of your siblings’ names were.
Amanda: Yes. Aggie, Danny, Cassie, Regan, Ryan, Kelly, Quinn.
Eric: Oh, in that order?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Aggie’s the oldest of seven?
Amanda: You gotta start with yourself, otherwise you can’t go through the full- the full Aggie-Danny-Cassie-Regan-Ryan-Kelly-Quinn.
Eric: Alright. So you’re going to walk in. There are two classes from North Country- from NCSS - in the auditorium ready. They're like rowdy and just pushing to do things that thirteen-to-fourteen-year-olds do when they're bored.
Amanda: That’s terrifying.
Brandon: Snapchat?
Julia: TikTok.
[Eric chuckles]
Eric: Alright, Brandon. Yeah, they’re snapchatting each other super hard. They’re like [high pitched teenager voice] “Hey, what’s up? At the Lake Town City Museum. Hanging out. Gonna see what happens. Old stuff. We out.”
Julia: “Like and subscribe.”
Eric: Yeah, and then they do the Fortnite dance. So, are you ready?
Amanda: Yes, I am ready. Nervous, but I’m ready.
Eric: Alright. How often have you done presentations like this?
Amanda: I do like two a week.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: They always start with the pre-produced video that someone’s nephew made on a summer internship.
Eric: Oh, for sure.
Brandon: [laughing] It’s cut in iMovie, all the transitions are awful.
Amanda: Oh, yes.
Eric: They’re all star swipes.
Amanda: The like shutter opening one?
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: But listen, he got that Communication credit at Lake Town City SUNY.
Amanda: He sure did.
Eric: SUNY- you can take summer classes at SUNY LTC!
Brandon: Cs get degrees!
[all laugh]
Julia: That’s true. Brandon’s not wrong.
Eric: First roll of the game! Amanda, roll a Performance check and I’ll give you Advantage because you’ve done this so often.
Julia: I just realized Amanda and I have like opposite dice.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: Uh, I got a 6.
Eric: You’ve got Advantage.
[dice rolls]
Amanda: I got a natural 1 that time, so…
[all laugh]
Brandon: Starting off strong!
Julia: Don’t block it with your hand! I feel like you’re messing up your rhythm by blocking it with your hand.
Amanda: Okay, I don't want it to fall off the table, but I will try to do a shorter- a shorter distance roll.
Julia: Do you wanna use my tray?
Amanda: Oh, I will, thank you.
Eric: Do you- what’s your modifier on Performance?
Amanda: Oh, it’s negative 1, bud, so I have a 7-1 for a 6.
Eric: Ha-ha! Okay…
Amanda: Aggie is straightforward. Not a lot of deception here.
Eric: That’s true. This is funny. It’s not that you’re bad at your job, it’s just that you have no idea how to make this into a presentation. You’re just like, “Alright, here are my points. I’m just gonna rattle them off,” and these kids are definitely not amused.
Amanda: I think what I think kids are interested in is not what kids are interested in.
Eric: [laughing] what are you saying?
Amanda: Uh, so Aggie, a little palms sweaty, smooths down her curly auburn hair back into a very functional bun, and walks up to the podium, gives everybody a little wave. The kids are not quieting down.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Hi, uh, good morning. Welcome to Historic Lake Town City!
[Eric muttering, imitating kids chattering]
Amanda [as Aggie]: I’m sure you’re all very happy to be out of school today, right?
Eric [as schoolkid]: Yeah, fuck school!
Brandon [as teacher]: Steven, language!
Eric [as schoolkid]: Oh, sorry, Miss.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Thank you. Uh, but today, it’s going to be really exciting. You get to walk around, be a part of living history, see how Lake Town City used to be, and -
Eric: [singing] Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bop-ba-bah!
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, okay, I guess we’ll watch the video.
[Eric laughs]
Eric: This is just- has the same early 2000s iMovie music.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: And you see that on the screen, the camera pans towards a man wearing a lab coat and very hipster coke-bottle glasses, and he’s staring at a fountain. And you see that someone is obviously walking up with the camera, and then he turns around and he says,
[old timey video music playing]
David Rheinstrom [as video host]: Oh, hi. I didn’t see you there! Welcome to the Historic Lake Town Museum, where you’re getting hands-on learning about where we all come from. I’m Sage Lanceleaf, chief curator of the Morrow Museum of the Future and Future Creations, or [pronouncing each letter] M-M-F-F-C.
[all laugh]
What does that mean? Well, I look to the past to see what might happen to Lake Town City in the future. Well, you’re sitting right there. Let me tell you how it all happened.
Chapter 1: How it all happened. Back in 1985, Dr. Cassandra Morrow was working on a very powerful clean energy source at her summer home in Lake Town. She built her own piece of atomic equipment in the basement of a bungalow!
Amanda: Aggie laughs and shakes her head.
David Rheinstrom [as video host]: As she moves all the atoms together, there’s a giant explosion of heat and energy, and from that she makes a new element, diaphorum. That’s from the greek word diaphora, meaning difference. She was ready to make a difference.
Chapter 2: What had happened next. What had happened next was that the town started to grow. Everyone wanted their hands on diaphorum, but the good doctor knew she had to hold them in check. She made everyone promise from CEOs to criminals to the President himself, that they couldn't get their hands on this new element without promising jobs, roads, houses, and more to her little Lake Town. And America is now 50% dependent on the clean energy of diaphorum.
Soon, our little town wasn’t so little. It became a city. A Lake Town City. A mix of everyone who wants to come and make a difference. We open our arms to the transplants, especially the New Yorkers who made the tough decision to move to Lake Town City after the tragedies of 9/11.
[music stops]
Amanda: Aggie bows her head.
Eric: And now there’s just a moment of silence.
David Rheinstrom [as video host]: Chapter Three: What Happened Wasn’t All Good. [music resumes] You can say that right. Think about Jim Taylorson, the tech guy at a big factory whose company will remain nameless, but you know. Jim tried to change the Industrial Area with his newfangled people movers.
Dr. Morrow said, “Those people movers are really dangerous.”
And Jim said [mocking voice], “They’re fine!”
And then they all exploded at the same time.
[music stops]
Brandon: Wait, the people?! Or the people movers?
Eric: The people movers.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Well, actually no, it’s very ambiguous.
[all laugh]
[music resumes]
David Rheinstrom [as video host]: That’s where we all get the term, “Jimmed it up” from, that Jim himself. But we can all learn from Jim’s mistakes. Ask for help!
Chapter Four: What is Happening Now? We’re all happening now! Dr. Morrow is still a big part of the city, acting as mayor for 30 years. She helped bring in our world-class public transportation, the sky tram system that takes you throughout the city by a speedy gondola, and a new high-speed rail that connects LTC with NYC. While you’re here, make sure to take in the sights, take in the theatre productions in the Arts District, or a hockey game at Thorn Hill Arena. Goooo Mountain Lobsters! Or grab a slice of our world-famous crayfish pie at Dominic’s.
Eric: [music stops as Eric speaks] I originally wrote, “Pesto Joseph’s” and I forgot I did.
[everyone cracking up]
Julia: That’s gotta be a respectable place.
Eric: I know, I just forgot.
Brandon: Pesto’s Joseph’s is very funny though.
David Rheinstrom [as video host]: And don’t forget to check out the amazing Historic Lake Town District, where it truly all began. But hey, wait! That’s where you are right now. Why don’t you take it away, Aggie, and tell ‘me more about it. [music fades]
Eric: And then there’s just a slow pan out away from Lance.
[all giggle]
Brandon: Does it just linger when it’s done zooming out for a good two-three seconds.
Eric: Oh yeah, like the video goes on way too much longer-
Brandon: You see the boom come down into the frame a little bit.
Eric: Yeah. And then it cuts out.
Amanda: Yeah, the lights come back up, and definitely see the kids texting-
[all laughing]
Amanda: But-
Amanda [as Aggie]: Yeah, I hope that you enjoy your visit here to Lake Town City. Couple rules to keep in mind - I know it’s not super cool, but it’s important to us. Yeah, well, just like the Adirondack State Park that we are within, there’s a carry-in-carry-out rule.
[Eric chuckling]
Anyone know what that means?
Julia [as a schoolkid]: Don’t leave your juuls in the thing?
Amanda [as Aggie]: … I don’t know why you’re carrying around jewels.
[all laughing]
That seems like a thing that you should leave in your safe at home, but-
Eric [as schoolkid]: Carry out these nuts! Ah! Got ‘em!
Brandon [as schoolkid]: Got ‘em!
Amanda: I look desperately around for a teacher and there is no one here.
Eric: They’re all just- they’re all also texting.
Amanda [as Aggie]: No, it means that if you have any trash, you gotta leave it in here in the building and throw it out. You don’t wanna take anything out of the Historic District that wasn’t yours to begin with. It’s important that we have this example of what Lake Town used to be before it became Lake Town City, because history is important.
Julia [as schoolkid]: Sucks.
Brandon [as a schoolkid]: Someone make sure we get Steven on the way out! Got ‘em!
Eric [as schoolkid]: Woooooow, Jeremy, I’m gonna beat you up later.
Julia [as schoolkid]: Steven’s trash!
Eric [as schoolkid]: Steven’s trash.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Anyway, since we’re a little off-season now from the summer heights, we only have a couple of outdoor activities. You can go down to the lake and see all kinds of historic watercraft that we have there, lovingly restored. It’s very exciting, actually, you can’t really see any scooters like that anymore and I don’t know- it’s cool. I think it’s neat.
And then you can be here in the museum and look at the wonderful interactive displays that we have in the lobby. I don't really get that newfangled tech, but I think you guys will. And otherwise, you can walk down Main Street. And we’ve worked hard to keep the architecture and the layout of Main Street just like how it used to be. So, enjoy your day. We’re meeting back here at 12:30 for lunch, and remember… Lake Town City. Yesterday’s promise today!
Eric: One of the teachers looks up and says,
Eric [as teacher]: Uh, does anyone have any questions for Amy?
Amanda [as Aggie]: It’s Aggie. Don’t worry about it.
Brandon [as schoolkid]: [with squeaky voice] Hello, um excuse me. I was just wondering, how much money do you make?
Amanda [as Aggie]: I am a civil servant, so I make a living wage.
[everyone laughs]
Brandon [as schoolkid]: Cool, so like not very much?
Eric [as schoolkid]: It sounds like not much!
Amanda [as Aggie]: There are many great careers available to residents of Lake Town City, from Morrow Corp all the way to our world class hockey arena, newly opened, to the high-speed train engineers and conductors! There’s lots of possibilities for you.
Brandon [as schoolkid]: Okay thank you. Writing down, “Don’t go into civil service.” Thanks!
Julia [as a schoolkid]: They got sweet bennies, though.
Eric [as schoolkid]: Who’s Benny?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Anyone else? Yes?
Julia [as schoolkid]: I’ll ask her. I’ll ask her. It’s fine.
Eric [as schoolkid]: Yeah, you got it, you got it.
Julia [as schoolkid]: So like, should we be worried about Monty?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, Monty. That’s more of a story that the community tells to keep us all together. No worries.
Eric [as a schoolkid]: But you know, isn't it more, if we’re going down to the lake, isn't it a public danger if there’s like a very large and dangerous and bloodthirsty mountain lobster in that lake?
Brandon [as a schoolkid]: I surfed on his back once!
Eric [as schoolkid]: No you didn’t! Shut up, Steven!
Julia [as schoolkid]: Shut up, Steve!
Amanda [as Aggie]: The biggest mountain lobster you’ll see today is that neon sign outside the original Astro’s. That’s the original Astro’s! You know that Astro’s national chain now! That’s the original right there.
Julia [as schoolkid]: Yo, let’s get a selfie outside of Astro’s.
Brandon [as schoolkid]: Yeah, let’s climb up on top of -
Eric [as teacher]: Alright, everyone, say thank you to Amy. We’re going to go down the Lake.
Brandon [as schoolkid]: [shouting] What’s for lunch?
Julia [as schoolkid]: Thanks, Amy.
Eric [as teacher]: I don’t know. Something on Main Street. Alright, let’s go.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Remember, Carry in, carry out!
Brandon [as schoolkid]: Come on Steven.
Eric [as schoolkid]: Carry out these nuts. Got ‘em!
Julia [as schoolkid]: Come on, Steven.
Eric [as schoolkid]: That's what I said earlier, I don’t know if you noticed.
Eric: So all the middle-schoolers are finally leaving you [laughing] Amanda, you look so beat down.
Amanda: Aggie is fully sweating.
Brandon: Middle schoolers suck.
Amanda: She does, by the way, understand some things about the world. Her youngest sibling is like only 22, so she has known some teenagers and is connected to the internet on her devices.
[all talking]
Julia: And has perhaps been one.
Amanda: Yeah, and was a teen, ten years ago.
Eric: Nice. Amanda, I want you to make a Perception check.
[sound of auditorium din]
Amanda: 14 + 4.
Eric: Alright, with an 18, while you have your flop sweat up in front of people, you are looking out in the crowd to see if anyone has a sympathetic face, and in the back, next to where all the teachers are texting and looking down, there is someone who looks very out of place.
Amanda: I forgot that things can happen to me in D&D.
[all chuckle]
And I just deal with them.
Eric: Someone is holding a notebook and taking notes very furiously. And they are dressed very, very stylishly, especially their bright turquoise leather jacket that stands out in the back. And as you’re wrapping up the presentation, they take some quick steps to you, and step forward to ask you a question.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, hi, how can I help you?
Eric [as turquoise jacket person]: Oh hey. It’s really nice to meet you. Hi, I’m Tegan Murphy. I’m actually - I know I don’t look like all the middle schoolers around here. I’m actually a reporter. Can I talk to you for a second?
Eric: Tegan Murphy is they/them. Tegan T-E-G-A-N and then Murphy, M-U-R-P-H-Y. And they take out their card and they give you the card and it says, “Tegan Murphy, Average Bear Reports.”
Amanda [as Aggie]: All interview requests do have to be routed through the press office for the Lake Town Historic District.
Eric [as Tegan]: Okay, well I didn't really want to know about the Historic District. I wanted to talk to you. Your job is really interesting, and I wanted to ask you some questions. Do you have time?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, you know, I’m just doing a patrol while these rowdy kids are out and about, so - I mean, yeah - any questions about the museum, though, or like the history of Lake Town I would have to send to my bosses, so…
Eric: As you’re answering this question, your beeper buzzes, and you look at it, and it says, “Mrs. Roper needs help.”
Amanda [as Aggie]: Um, could I- could I come back at lunch or give you a call later? I just - I am technically the super for basically all of these bungalows, so sometimes I get called. And usually I have to turn someone’s router on and off again, but sometimes it’s time sensitive.
Eric: Yeah, while you put the beeper back in your pocket, the hologram is poking out, and it’s just like,
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: [distorted] Aggie! Aggie, something happened again. I need your help!
Eric [as Tegan]: Yeah, you can call me whenever. My phone number’s on the card. I just want to know about your job, and you’ve been living here for so long, and what it means to be the custodian of Historic Lake Town. I just think it’s cool. So yeah, send me a text. Give me a call. I am actually from New York City, but I took the train up here, so I’m kind of just staying in one of the hotels over there, or in the Train Station District. So just let me know. I’m around.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Thanks.
Eric [as Tegan]: You’ll notice me. I’m the one with the turquoise jacket.
Amanda [as Aggie]: It’s a very pretty jacket.
Eric [as Tegan]: Thank you. I think it is too. That’s why I wear it all the time, so people can identify me.
Amanda [as Aggie]: You know, I wear a jacket all the time, too. People, I don't know, it’s nice. People know who you are from down the street, and they can call out to you and stop saying mean things if that’s what they’re doing. It’s pretty good.
Eric [as Tegan]: If they make a turquoise Carhartt jacket, you should get one, 100%.
Amanda [as Aggie]: That’s a great idea.
Eric [as Tegan]: Look it up. It’s fashion now, so you’re actually very fashion forward.
Amanda [as Aggie]: What is fashion?
[all laugh]
Eric: From your beeper, it’s like,
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Aggie, it’s happening! I need you!
Amanda [as Aggie]: Okay, I will definitely give you a call. Thanks for getting in touch.
Eric [as Tegan]: Alright, cool. No problem.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Enjoy Lake Town.
Eric [as Tegan]: I will. Go… Mountain Lions? Is that it?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Lobsters. Very close though. They’re kind of like the lion of the sea, so-
Eric [as Tegan]: Got it. That’s deep. That’s good. That’s pretty good.
Amanda: And I’ll head over in my pickup around the other side of the lake where Mrs. Roper lives.
Eric: Alright, so you go over to the bungalow where you know Mr. and Mrs. Roper are there- they actually - your parents have told you that Mr. and Mrs. Roper have lived here forever, and they know everything there is to know about Lake Town.
Amanda: They’re also really nice. Whenever we would throw baseballs or like kick a soccer ball onto their yard - only broke a window once, but they never yelled at us about it.
Eric: Yeah, and she - there’s always something going wrong at the Ropers. So you head over there, and both Mr. and Mrs. Roper is standing over the toilet, just yelling at it.
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric: Just being like,
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Stop! Please stop running! Stop! Please! Aggie! Please help us!
Eric: And Mr. and Mrs. Roper, they're both like in their 80s but they look amazing. They both look like they’re 50.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Oh, Aggie, thank you so much for coming. The toilet is doing the thing again.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Uh, don’t worry about it. Just take a step out. Make some coffee, make some tea. I’ll have this done in a jiff.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Okay.
Eric: Mr. Roper immediately goes over to his oversized chair and sits down and watches his- a replay of a Mountain Lobsters game, while Mrs. Roper stands and watches you as you mess around with the toilet.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Mrs. Roper, we have discussed this. It’s very helpful if you could step back a little bit, just so that you don’t get your nice house shoes there- don’t want any water compromising that. Maybe just take the bathmat and I’ll… just give me a sec.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: But I don’t have anyone to talk to. Monty doesn’t really want to talk to me, and I just have so much to say! So I want to know how you’re doing, how are you? What’s going on? How are the parents? How are your siblings? Tell me everything. I’m bored.
Amanda [as Aggie]: S-Sure.
Julia: Is Mr. Roper also named Monty?
Eric: Yes. He’s also named Monty.
Julia: Cool.
Amanda: Oh! Alright, so Aggie’s going to kneel down, take out her wrench, and it’s just - I just have to tighten the water pipe.
Eric: Oh yeah, I’m not gonna make you roll for this, it’s totally easy.
Amanda: Yeah, but I like look into the tank, make sure the stopper is working well, do a thorough job, then I’m like,
Amanda [as Aggie]: Yeah, so my parents, um, I don't know if they're in Thailand or Malaysia right now. They’re just on their world tour. I don’t remember, actually, the last time they were in the states, but they're just, you know, in retirement and living large. It’s great!
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: That’s interesting. That’s nice. And your siblings are good? You’re all good?
Amanda [as Aggie]: They’re good, yeah. You know, Danny just got a Guggenheim fellowship. That’s that art museum down in the city.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: No I don’t! Where do they have fellows?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Well they like to give different artists money each year to make their art, and they have a huge exhibit about it, and I haven’t heard of anyone else that was in the fellowship, but they called him the “Modern Edward Hopper.”
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Oh!
Amanda [as Aggie]: Yeah.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Oh wow.
Amanda [as Aggie]: So that’s good. Cassie, she is in Montreal now, actually, so not too far away. But she… Do you know what Instagram is?
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: No.
Amanda [as Aggie]: It’s like inter- like do you know what Facebook is?
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: No.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda [as Aggie]: Well, alright, it’s like a lot of people online really love her tattoos and she is super famous, and she is in Berlin now for a lot of the year. I think she and my parents met up for Thanksgiving in Paris this past year.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Oh that’s so nice. I wish I would go to Paris. Paris sounds good.
Amanda [as Aggie]: I would like to as well! I think Regan’s actually performing there soon. She opened up for this band, “The Highway Women.” They’re awesome. They’re three country musicians, and they sing all kinds of songs and covers and also their own, but yeah, she’s opening for them and -
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: You know, I can’t - I do want to get this off my chest. I do want to hear about the rest of the children but -
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: I have to get this off my chest. Did you know, you know Ma’s? Ma’s Ice Cream Shop?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Yeah.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: It might close down.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Why?
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: It’s - look, I don’t know. I thought it was all protected by the government and all those things, but it’s just - it’s - I don’t know…
Amanda [as Aggie]: They have a whole franchise over by the hockey stadium.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: I don’t know, it’s just not doing well. I don’t know what it is. Ma said that it’s just not coming in the way that she thought - running the books, but you know what I think? I think someone’s - someone must be stealing something over there.
Amanda [as Aggie]: That would be… that would be pretty upsetting.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: It has to be - why - who could fail Lake Town? Who can? The whole - everybody’s supporting us! We’re all everybody’s favorite? Why would anybody want it to fall apart?
Amanda [as Aggie]: I’ll go check in on them. How about that?
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Ah, I don’t think you… If you want. Don’t say it was from me.
Amanda [as Aggie]: No, no. Of course not.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: It’s not from me. I just tell people the things that they need to hear to let them go around. Is the toilet fixed yet?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Yes, but you know, you could give me a call if you need me. You don’t have to loosen the knob on the toilet here -
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: I didn’t loosen anything!
Amanda [as Aggie]: Just - just in case.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Everyone knows Priscilla Roper just has a mouth to flap around and she doesn't do any sort of things like that.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, okay.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: I just need someone to talk to.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Okay, listen I can-
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: These two things are unrelated. The toilet was broken and also I’m happy you’re over because I have hot gos to talk about.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Of course, I’m always happy to see you- both of you. And how about I stop by in a couple days? I can come by after supper and just see how you guys are doing.
Eric [as Mrs. Roper]: Oh, that would be very nice thank you.
Amanda [as Aggie]: Sure, I will. I will.
Eric: So we leave Aggie. You’re fixing the toilet - [laughing]
Amanda: There’s nothing wrong with it.
[all laughing]
Eric: Just doing the regular thing.
Amanda: It’s just running. It’s just an old toilet.
Eric: Alright, so we leave Aggie with the toilet, and we’re going to go over to a different part of the city. Julia, do you want odd or even?
Julia: I’ll take an odd.
Eric: Okay.
[dice rolling]
[groovy bass riff introduces an electric rock music theme]
Eric: So we go over from Historic Lake Town District, we stay in the northern part of the city as we scan over to Companyton which was a neighborhood that was thrown together when all the industry started flooding into Lake Town City in the early 90s. People needed places to live, so the not-so-well the industries just kind of threw places together for people to live, like tenement apartments, just like shitty one-family houses thrown together. And on the top of a third-floor walkup, as we hear an 80s Devo beat, we zoom into the apartment of Milo. And the alarm goes off at 8:35.
[imitating alarm] wah-wah-wah!
And Brandon, please introduce your character.
Brandon [as Milo]: Aw, shit, I have to be at work in ten minutes. I can’t believe I keep doing this!
Brandon: Um, my name is Milo Lane. Yes, I bowl. Yes, it is also a coincidence.
Eric: M-I-L-O, L-A-N-E?
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: He/him. Milo is your average guy who has a ghost cat.
[all laugh]
Amanda: Say what now? Is your ghost cat’s name Sushi as well?
Brandon: Uh, Tuna.
[all cheer and laugh]
Which is why I laughed so hard a little bit ago.
Julia: Do I need to get a fish-related pet now?
Eric: No, don’t do it.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: What kind of cat is Tuna again?
Brandon: Tuna is a red bicolor Devon Rex, which is a cat that’s real smart, real mischievous, and likes to be at the highest point of every room.
Amanda: Like a little goat! Little goat cat!
Eric: If I remember, it was like orange and white striped in that way?
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: And -
Brandon: They’re real dicks.
Eric: Yeah. Tuna’s sitting on your chest and looking at you, and Tuna says
[music stops]
Eric [as Tuna]: Yeah, I turned off your first three alarms, because I would be - I thought it would be funny. It was a funny thing to do.
Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna, we’ve been over this. I need you to not screw up my career.
Eric [as Tuna]: Yeah, but like, if you’re fired then we can hang out more.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, I’m gonna take a shower.
Eric: And Milo gets up. Tuna hops off of you, and as you go over to take a shower, and you close the door, Tuna just kind of jumps through the door, like phases through it, because Tuna is in fact, a ghost.
Amanda: Oh. Just a full ghost!
Eric: Just a full ghost.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: So Tuna still acts like a cat, but they can move through walls and doors and stuff.
Julia: Does Tuna appear ghostly? Or does Tuna appear like a regular cat who can phase through things?
Eric: That’s a good question. What do you think, Brandon?
Brandon: Yeah, they’re sort of… more like the cat in Alice in Wonderland. So they sort of appear solid, but you can tell that there’s something off. And like when they phase through things, they sort of become sort of transparent.
Eric: Yes, definitely when they phase through things. That’s good to know.
Amanda: I started thinking something was off when Eric said, “The cat says…”
[Eric and Amanda laugh]
[sound of shower]
Eric: So while you're taking a shower, Tuna phases through the shower curtain and says
Eric [as Tuna]: So, how’s it going today, boss? How’s, uh, what are you up to?
Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna, I’m taking - we’ve been over this as well. The bathroom time is me time.
Eric [as Tuna]: We did, we did go over it, but I was not paying attention.
Brandon [as Milo]: Right, okay, well this is me time and today I’m going to work, and I think I have [sighs] I think I have four or five tours today, which is a lot to do in one day.
Eric [as Tuna]: That’s true. And you have those interns, which I know is your favorite thing.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh my god, the interns, yes. They’re all so bad at their jobs!
Eric [as Tuna]: Truly. Well, also, I moved your clock back by - I moved your clock forward by fifteen minutes-
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, great!
Eric [as Tuna]: So it’s actually nine now.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, cool.
Eric [as Tuna]: Bye!
Eric: Tuna just phases through the tub, and just goes away.
Brandon: Yeah, so Milo takes a shower, gets ready, and rushes over to his job at the museum.
Eric: Right, so you have to take SkyTram to get there.
Brandon: Right.
Eric: SkyTram is literally like a ski gondola.
Amanda: SkyTram!
Eric: But it’s faster, and it moves even quicker than I guess whatever subway or train you might have in your city. It picks people up very quickly, and you have to run over to the station that takes you to wherever else in the city. Why don’t you make a Dexterity roll for me?
[dice rolls]
Brandon: 4.
[Eric laughs]
Julia: I blessed those dice for you. What happened?
Brandon: As Milo’s walking up to the museum, he pulls on his polo over his - well he realizes he put on his Star Trek shirt from middle school.
Amanda: Oh!
Brandon: It’s like half a size too small, so it’s just gonna be a - it’s gonna be an uncomfortable day for him.
Eric: It’s like, “Oh that’s why people were looking at me on the SkyTram!”
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: “Because I was wearing a children’s shirt.”
Brandon: Yeah, a children’s shirt. 100%.
Eric: [laughing] You pull out your emergency polo, which is really just a really disgusting green/
Brandon: Mhm.
Eric: As you come in. And where does Milo work?
Brandon: Milo works at the [pronouncing like a word] MMFFC.
[all laugh]
Eric: The Morrow Museum of Future and Future Creations.
Brandon: Yes. Milo’s a museum educator at the MMFFC, and he’s really good at his job. He’s extremely social, he knows how to get people excited about the museum exhibits there, which, let’s be real, some of them are very boring.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: He’s the only museum educator that works there, but he works alongside a cadre of various museum workers, researchers and exhibit specialists and that kind of stuff.
Eric: Mhm. And the Future Museum, which some people just call it the Future Museum, it was built in the ‘90s to celebrate Dr. Morrow’s creations, so it’s very ‘90s cyberpunk, so it’s envisioning what the future would look like in 25, 30 years, but of course that’s now, so it just looks totally out of place. So it’s very modular. There are a lot of lights just in random places, but of course it’s like the Science Museum in New York City. But then also just a bunch of, all of Dr. Morrow’s work throughout the years was put here, like the first SkyTram gondola is featured in the Future Museum, for example.
Amanda: Cool.
Brandon: Mhm. He goes to the break room, grabs a cup of coffee as quick as he can, then swings by his manager’s office to say,
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, I’m sorry I’m late again. I’m gonna go grab my tour. Sorryyyy! I’ll stay late today, byeeeee!
Eric [as manager]: Hey- hold on. Hold on.
Eric: Your manager is Mr. Brewpot.
[all snickering]
Mr. Brewpot, you can only refer to him as Mr. Brewpot. He’s like the ops manager for the museum.
Amanda: But there are so many possible nicknames! Including and not limited to Brewsky.
Eric: Again, he’s a very serious man. Do not call him by any nickname. He is Mr. Brewpot.
Brandon: When he’s not around, we call him Brewsky.
Amanda: Good.
Eric: Mr. Brewpot has a very thick mustache, and a very clean tie. Those are the things you need to know about Mr. Brewpot. He’s like,
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Hey, Milo! Milo, come back.
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, I’m here.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Alright, Milo I need- because you were late again, I do need someone to do this for me, and you are going to be the one who’s doing it for me. Thank you for volunteering.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, alright.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: You know, there’s the - charity auction is tonight.
Brandon [as Milo]: Yep.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: And I need someone to go down and bid on a new thing for the museum. There are a bunch of Dr. Morrow’s original notes-
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, cool.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: For diaphorum, and you know, I don't wanna work late. I gotta go back to the other Brew Pots back home, so you’re gonna do it for me.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, yeah, that’s fair.
Eric: Okay, so he opens up his desk, and in a manila envelope, there’s $500 in there.
Brandon: Cool.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Hey, I don’t know how much this is even worth, but a lot of - this all goes to charity, to the Historic Lake District. Just try to get it under 500. It’s going to be inflated, just do it.
Brandon [as Milo]: Cool, I’ll try to get a larger amount of money to benefit the people there.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Yeah, you can - feel free to use… [sighs] Don’t think about it. Just bid 500 and then everybody will be super - “Oh wow, the Morrow people are donating,”
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Just bid the 500, okay?
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, I mean I do this online all the time. I got it. You know.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Okay, I don’t know what that is, so…
Brandon [as Milo]: eBay. You’ve never been… cool tie today, by the way.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Oh thank you, it’s my good one. Because I was gonna go to this, but I’m not, because you’re going to.
Brandon [as Milo]: Ah. Do I need to wear a tie, sir?
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Yes.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: I told you to bring a tie for today.
Brandon [as Milo]: I am going to need to buy a tie.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: That’s fine. I’ll give you one.
Eric: He roots around in his desk and he takes out just an orange and white striped tie.
Brandon: Great.
Eric: And Tuna pokes out of your backpack and says,
Eric [as Tuna]: Looks just like me!
Brandon: And I shove the tie into my backpack.
Eric [as Tuna]: Hey! Ah! Hey! Hey!
Brandon [as Milo]: Alright, thank you. I appreciate that. I will get it back to you dry-cleaned and smudge free.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Thank you. Remember: 500… say it back to me, what do you do?
Brandon [as Milo]: Go bid 500 bucks at the charity auction. Get the original notes from Dr. Morrow.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Great. Thank you.
Brandon [as Milo]: Thank you for understanding my tardiness. I’ve got a tour that starts in five minutes. I’m gonna go knock their socks off.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Sounds great. Do it.
Brandon [as Milo]: Thank you.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Don’t mess up!
Amanda: What a boss.
Julia: I need to know everything about the Brewpot family.
Amanda: Oh yeah, 100%.
Julia: What are their children’s names? How many children do they have?
Eric: It’s true. You are- you’re showing around three interns, and you’re gonna give them a tour pretty much of what’s going on here. I want you to give me a - because you were late and you weren’t able to put yourself together, just give me a History roll.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: Uh, that is a 6 + 3 for a 9.
Eric: Alright, so you have to show the interns around. What are you gonna show them first?
Brandon [as Milo]: Hello, interns! Welcome to the MMFFC. Can everyone say that back to me real fast?
All [as interns]: MMFFC
Brandon [as Milo]: No, I’m sorry. Right back there. MMFFC.
Amanda [as intern]: MMMMMM-F-C
Brandon [as Milo]: Closer. Alright great, welcome. Thank you for joining our intern program this semester. You’re gonna have a ton of fun, you’re gonna learn some stuff, you’re gonna help some people, and you’re gonna make some -
[Amanda yawning]
Excuse me! And you’re gonna make some money! Um, so we’re gonna start off - well, first of all, just to orient you guys, we do have a lot of weird names for things. It is very lame. I’m sorry. Let’s not take any questions on it. Yes, I’m a museum educator. Yes, they do call me a museum edu-tainer. It’s fine.
[all groan]
I’ve fought the battle. It’s not a battle worth fighting anymore.
Eric [as intern]: Oooh! I have a question! I have a question!
Brandon [as Milo]: Um, sure, yeah what’s up?
Eric [as intern]: Hello. What is your favorite exhibit in the museum?
Amanda [as intern]: Suck up.
Julia [as intern]: Jenny, just be quiet please.
Eric [as intern]: It’s really important for me to learn!
Brandon [as Milo]: You’re all adult college students. Please don’t - just be cool, okay.
Eric [as intern]: Okay, but like, which one’s your favorite?
Julia [as intern]: Jenny, be cool.
Brandon [as Milo]: I really like the, um -
Brandon: Let me look at the map real fast.
Julia [as intern]: Jenny, we were up so late smoking doobs…
Amanda [as intern]: Just be cool, please.
Eric [as intern]: Don’t tell him we were smoking doobs!
Julia [as intern]: Why are you so enthusiastic?
Eric [as intern]: I was not smoking doobs.
Amanda [as intern]: Be cool, Jenny, for once.
Julia [as intern]: Just- Jenny please.
Brandon [as Milo]: My favorite thing is the original equipment that Dr. Morrow used to create the diaphorum. We have some experimental gear that didn't work, which is super interesting to see how and why it didn’t work and then why it did work. That’s really interesting. And don’t tell the public, but some of it is still operational.
Eric [as intern]: Oh! That is very important for me to know!
Eric: And writes it down in their notes.
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah! Don’t touch it!
Eric [as intern]: Oh, I will not.
Amanda [as intern]: Sounds unsafe.
Julia [as intern]: Yeah, super unsafe.
Brandon [as Milo]: It’s behind plexiglass. It’s fine. Don’t - look I’m letting you in. You help me, I help you. You help me, I help you.
Eric [as intern]: So we should not go into the plexiglass?
Julia [as intern]: No.
Brandon [as Milo]: No, don’t do anything that I don’t tell you to do, please. Unless it’s like, “Clean the floor.”
Eric [as intern]: Yeah.
Julia [as intern]: We have to clean the floor?
Brandon [as Milo]: No, I’m just saying if you’re bored and you want to do something, that’s the most you can do, please.
Amanda [as intern]: Okay.
Eric: Okay, you’re giving them a tour around. You’re showing them all the exhibits, and the break room, and your little office, and where Mr. Brewpot’s office is, and he comes out and he’s like
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Children, happy to have you on board.
Eric: And then just goes back into the office.
Amanda [as intern]: Sir, sir, sir!
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Yeah?
Amanda [as intern]: Are you- are you Brewski’s dad?
Brandon [as Milo]: [under his breath] Brewpot! Brewpot! Brewpot! Brewpot!
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: I’m sorry, who?
Amanda [as intern]: John Brewpot…
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: Oh, you know John! How’s John doing? You’re one of-
Amanda [as intern]: John’s a fucking legend, man.
Julia [as intern]: Yeah, John’s so cool.
Eric [as Mr. Brewpot]: I am going to walk away and not engage with this conversation anymore. Goodbye.
Brandon [as Milo]: Please do. It’s the first day, I’m sorry, Mr. Brewpot.
Eric: He just slams the door.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh… well, okay. Great job, guys! Getting off on a good start with the boss. Let’s go this way.
Julia [as intern]: Sick.
Eric [as intern]: Um, excuse me, Mr. Milo.
Brandon [as Milo]: Just call me Milo, you don’t have to call me Mr.…
Eric [as intern]: Okay, um, Milo. You showed us everything, but like, what’s that?
Eric: And Jenny is - her name is Jenny apparently - she’s pointing to this exhibit you’ve never seen before. It looks like - have any of you seen “The Fly” before?
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Mhm.
Eric: You know the containment chamber - the literal thing that the fly is? It literally looks like that. It’s like a honeycomb with like little rubber things on the outside, but the door is sealed shut with like frosted and darkened glass. And you’ve never seen it before.
Brandon [as Milo]: Uh… Did you guys see this come in this morning? I’m usually briefed on the new stuff.
Eric [as intern]: I don’t know, I - today is my first day and everything I know you have told me.
[Julia and Amanda chuckling]
Brandon [as Milo]: Right, I was late, and I didn’t know how early you guys got here. I assume - I was late, so I assume you guys were here 30 minutes early, benefit of the doubt, my tardiness becomes your benefit, so I guess you didn’t see any of it?
Eric: Milo, you hear a voice from inside there that says
Eric [as voice]: [imitating a ghost] Ooooo! Let me out! Oooo!
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, is this one of y’all? Is this like a fun first day prank? Ha-ha? We’re science educators here. Yes, we want to have fun, but fun needs to stay off the exhibits.
Julia [as intern]: Is that a joke?
Eric [as intern]: I don’t know, what are you talking about?
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, um…
Brandon: DM, is there any like placard or anything up yet?
Eric: Um, no, not yet. You’re in the back area where the offices are.
Brandon: Right.
Eric: And this is kind of just like in the staging area of where it is, and it does seem like this is very new. Like they dropped this off at 9Amanda: and you ran in at 9:15.
Brandon: Right.
Eric: So you didn’t see people drop it in.
Brandon: Alright, okay. Milo takes out some gloves that he uses when he handles anything sensitive, and knocks on the door and says,
Brandon [as Milo]: Hello, you’re so funny.
Brandon: And starts to open the door of the chamber
Eric: It looks like it’s sealed. This was probably made by Dr. Morrow, and the door looks like it’s supposed to slide open, but it doesn't because it's stuck shut. And the voice inside says,
Eric [as voice]: Oh, who is that? Who is that outside?
Brandon [as Milo]: It’s Milo, who are you? This is so funny…
Eric [as voice]: I… I, oh god, I haven't been able to hear somebody in so long. Thank you, thank you. Who- Milo? Who is Milo?
Brandon [as Milo]: I’m one of the museum educators here. Who are you? Are you one of the interns?
Eric [as voice]:What museum? What are you talking about?
Brandon [as Milo]: The MMFFC!
Eric [as voice]: What?
Brandon [as Milo]: That’s where we are. This isn’t very funny. Like, is this supposed to be a joke?
Amanda [as intern]: Who is he talking to?
Julia [as intern]: I don’t know what’s happening.
Eric [as intern]: I don’t know. I don’t know who he’s talking to.
Julia [as intern]: This is weird.
Eric: At this point, Tuna wriggles out from your pocket. You just see Tuna’s face in his pocket, like
Eric [as Tuna]: Milo, you stupid idiot. Who do you think is in there?
Brandon [as Milo]: I- I don’t know, an intern-
Eric [as Tuna]: No! What? No there’s another- another one like… another ghost in there!
Brandon [as Milo]: Aw, fuck.
Eric [as Tuna]: There’s a ghost in- yeah, hell yeah, dude.
Eric: And Tuna climbs out of your pocket and gets on your shoulder, and tries to phase through it and bounces off.
Brandon [as Milo]: That’s never happened-
Eric: And lands on their feet because they’re a cat.
Brandon [as Milo]: One, Tuna, serves you right. Two, that’s never happened before. What is going on? Do you know?
Eric [as voice]: Hey, I don’t know how to open this up, but there is an emergency keyhole somewhere on the outside. If you can get into - Dr. Morrow always had a key to open this. It literally looked like an old key to open this because she’s an old weirdo. Let me - I can tell you what this machine is if you just let me out.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay? I’m happy to, I just gotta find this key and the keyhole, apparently.
Eric [as voice]: Yeah it was in her - Listen, I used to work for Dr. Morrow.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay.
Eric [as voice]: But I can’t tell you all that much while I’m in here. If you get the keyhole- the emergency keyhole opening, you should be able to figure it out.
Brandon [as Milo]: Can I-
Eric [as voice]: It should be in her old effects or something, I don’t know.
Brandon [as Milo]: Alright. Alright, thank you.
Brandon: DM, can I roll a History check to see if I know if the key is in the museum?
Eric: Yes.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: 15 + 3 for 18.
Amanda: Hey!
Eric: Alright, with 18, you know- you’ve looked at all of the - there’s an entire exhibit for Dr. Morrow’s effects, you know like you go to an exhibit, and everything's under glass, and you’re like, “Oh look at this! Look at this! Look at this!”
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: It’s - you don’t have this, but you do know the benefit auction is always to auction off pieces of Lake Town history, so you bet that if you checked the catalogue of all the things that are being auctioned off, you would probably be able to grab this key - this key, an emergency science key, that people might not know -
Amanda: [chuckling] you know.
Eric: It literally looks like an old-fashioned energy key. That looks kind of like an old iron- like my mom used to go to all of these picker things and there were always like just giant fucking iron wrought keys. Like it probably just looks like an ornamental version of one of those, and that would go really well at an auction.
Julia: Dr. Morrow loved a thrift store.
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, um, I don’t remember any keys. Um, in the collection right now, but there’s probably - it’s probably… if this is new, it’s probably at the auction tonight, I assume. So can you hang out for a day?
Eric [as intern]: I…
Amanda: All the interns shake their heads like, “no…”
Eric [as intern]: I don’t wanna hang out. What?
Eric: The voice inside says,
Eric [as voice]: I don’t have anywhere to be. I’ll be here, apparently. You’re the only person I can talk to-
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay.
Eric [as voice]: Which is weird. Ooo because I’m deaaaaaad, get it?
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, no. I know what’s going on, I just - I can’t help you until I can get the key. I’m sorry. This - look… it doesn't happen very often, It has happened in the past. We always figure it out. It’s chill. In the meantime, don’t spook anyone?
Eric [as voice]: Okay, I- I’ll stay here. Okay that’s fine.
Brandon [as Milo]: Thank you.
Eric: All the interns are very confused at you at the moment.
Julia [as intern]: You just talking to that pod, man-
Eric [as intern]: You guys talking about the…
Amanda [as intern]: No.
Eric [as intern]: Do I need to write all of this down?
Brandon [as Milo]: You guys are taking notes?!
Amanda [as intern]: I think he’s practicing empathetic curation.
Eric and Julia [as interns]: Ooooh!
Amanda [as intern]: And talking to - you remember guys from sociology? You talk to the item and think about its history and context, and you know, it’s just… I’m taking notes in my head!
Julia [as intern]: Professor Green talked about that. I remember that.
Amanda [as intern]: Mhm. Mhm.
Brandon [as Milo]: No, that was just a bit, y’all. Was it not very funny?
[Eric laughing]
Julia [as intern]: No. It kind of sucked, man.
Eric [as intern]: No it was pretty bad.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, okay.
Amanda [as intern]: Can’t really get a read on you yet.
Eric [as intern]: I don’t understand old people humor, so-
Brandon [as Milo]: I didn’t tell you guys this yet, but whoever laughs at my bits, I’ll let you into the fun research part of the museum, so.
[all fake laughing]
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go to the breakroom and have coffee or whatever for a little bit. Thank you!
Amanda [as intern]: Woo!
Brandon [as Milo]: Meet me back here for the first tour at ten…
Brandon: Milo looks at his watch,
Brandon [as Milo]: I think the first tour is at 10:15?
Eric: Mhm.
Amanda [as intern]: Alright.
Julia [as intern]: Alright. We need coffee, man.
Eric [as intern]: Bye!
Brandon [as Milo]: And someone bring me some coffee!
Julia [as intern]: Okay.
[transition note]
Eric: Hey, is Eric. Maybe you have a game that you go back to when you're feeling lost or tired, or just need something comforting to help you with. Maybe it's something that was really difficult when you were a kid, and now you just want to dominate it with your adult knowledge, or it's something that you remember being so good at when you were 10 that you want to see if you're actually still just as good. I pulled out my game cube just to see if I could still play FIFA 2002 as well as I remember. I think this is the chance to go do that. This is the midroll. Your memory card still works.

Okay, let’s get back to the show.
[transition note]
[upbeat 80s-style rock music plays]
Eric: Alright, let’s go to our final player. We go from downtown Lake Town City, and we go over to Little Italy. We blow through some of the fall leaves on the street, as tough guys just kick through the leaves on the street, and we go over to Dominic's, the famous pizza place of Lake Town City. And above Dominic’s, in a studio apartment, but an inexplicably beautiful four-poster bed- [Amanda laughs] - is Val, as their alarm clock goes off at 10:30.
[imitating alarm clock] eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!
Julia: A hand just slams down and crushes it.
[all laughing]
Brandon: Seems like an irresponsible waste of money.
Amanda: Is there a pile of crushed ones next to the -
Julia: Oh yeah there is.
Amanda: Okay!
Julia: They’re in the trash at least. They’re not just scattered around the apartment.
Amanda: Okay.
Eric: Alright, Julia, introduce your character.
Julia: So you’re meeting Val Vesuvio.
Amanda: Oh!
Julia: Who-
Eric: Oh god, we’re gonna need to spell that.
Brandon: Yeah, how do you spell that?
Julia: So that is V-A-L, V-E-S-U-V-I-O.
Eric: [in New York accent] Vesuvio!
Julia: Vesuvio!
Eric: ‘ey! Whaddaya gonna do it! Ey!
Amanda: Like the mountain. It blew up once.
Eric: A fuckin’ volcano! It’s the best volcano, yo! Tell yo friends!
Amanda: It’s in Sicily!
Julia: You can see my great, great, great, great grandpa. He’s still in the … lava?
[all laugh]
Julia: So Val is just in boxer shorts, a beat-up band t-shirt from some concert they went to in College Hill a couple years ago - it’s all torn up, but not in a cool way.
Eric: No, it’s just very old and very comfy.
Julia: It’s very old, it’s a little stinky, the sleeves are cut off, but not in an even way whatsoever.
Amanda: Great.
Brandon: They just fell off over time because it became decrepit.
Amanda: Does it have the half inch of a sleeve remaining to make it a cut-off?
Julia: Yeah, absolutely.
Amanda: Like just tear the head - just do the stitches, it’s fine!
Julia: Nah. Not gonna happen.
Eric: No, it’s fine. It looks cool.
Julia: Val looks at the broken alarm clock which is now frozen on 10:30-
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: And checks their phone to see what day it is.
Eric: Again, the holo screen pops out, and it is the fall equinox.
Julia: And what day of the week?
Eric: Uh, it’s… let’s see, the auction would probably happen on a Thursday.
Julia: Alright. Thursday means that they’re working at Dominic’s.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: So they’re gonna hop in the shower, just do something with their hair - it's shaved on both sides and then just kind of flops to one side, just a little bit of gel thrown in there, but not a lot. And they have to be at work in… five minutes?
Eric: Oh yeah, 100%.
Brandon: What workplace starts at 10:35?
Eric: A pizza place! [laughing]
Julia: Opens at 11, you gotta get the kitchens ready and stuff like that.
Brandon: Oh that’s true, that’s true.
Julia: That’s when Val starts. It’s not when everyone else shows up.
Eric: Yeah, so what's Val- we kind of have an idea of everyone's fashion. What does Val wear even to work?
Julia: To work it’s just like ripped up jeans, a different shirt that they kind of picked up off the floor and like sniffed to make sure it was work-appropriate.
[Brandon laughs]
Amanda: Yeah, uh huh.
Eric: Sure.
Julia: It’s for a different band that they saw at College Hill,
Amanda: It smells like marinara still, but that’s okay.
Julia: It smells a little bit like crawfish, but like, what can you do? That one’s for a band called Johnny Crash and the Hell Holes.
Amanda: Yay!
Eric: [laughing] Alright, I gotta write that one down.
Brandon: That’s a very good band name.
Eric: That’s very good.
Julia: Throw on a pair of Doc Martens, the most comfortable shoes that they own, and then of course, a spiked leather jacket.
Eric: Of course.
Julia: Of course.
Eric: You never go anywhere without your spiked leather jacket.
Julia: You can’t go anywhere without the spiked leather jacket.
Eric: That’s true, you gotta fuck somebody up. Just in case.
Julia: Yup, and so they throw all that on and they run downstairs to work.
[music stops]
[sounds of a bustling kitchen]
Eric: Alright, yeah, so you’re working at Dominic’s today. As soon as you go in, you’re just hit by the wafting smell of woodfire, and someone just made tomato sauce, and also because this is the home of the crayfish pie, you’re hit with seafood as well.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: As you walk in, everyone at the back is like
Eric [as pizza worker]: Ah, hey, it’s Val! Thanks for showing up! Hey! We’ve all been here since 5 in the morning makin’ dough!
Julia: If you’re gonna be fuckin’ chumps, you’re gonna be fuckin’ chumps. What do you want me to do?
Eric [as pizza worker]: Oh yeah, we’re the fuckin’ chumps. Ey, you think you’re better than me?
Julia: Yeah!
[Amanda and Eric laughing]
Eric [as pizza worker]: Oh yeah, good point. [muttering]
Eric: So what do you do when you’re at Dominic’s?
Julia: Val’s usually in charge of tossing the pizzas first and foremost. I think sometimes they work at the counter, but like it has to be slow and the other counter person isn’t there that day, because otherwise trouble starts.
Amanda: Last resort.
Julia: You do not want Val in a customer-facing job.
Amanda: Fair, fair. It’s good to know yourself and your strengths. I respect that.
Julia: Yeah, they can pound a dough like nobody’s business though, so-
[all laugh]
Amanda: I love that you don’t have to prepare the dough, but you can throw it.
Julia: Mhm. I can throw it, I can pound it. Someone else has to add the yeast, but I’m not gonna do it.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: Uh, well here’s the thing. Dominic, who is also Dom Five. They call him Dom Five because he is fifth in the order of Dominics.
Julia: Yeah, Dominic the fifth.
Eric: So Dom Five is the manger, and-
Julia: Sure, proprietor.
Eric: It’s owned by the Dominic family, but he’s the proprietor of this one. So he steps out and he’s like
Eric [as Dom Five]: Ahhhh fuck okay, you’re just gonna roll in whenver you want? That’s just your thing? That’s your personality?
Julia [as Val]: [talking over Dom] Is that a problem? I’m here
Eric [as Dom Five]: That’s your fuckin’ personality?
Julia [as Val]: I’m fuckin’ here aren’t I? The door isn’t open yet.
Eric [as Dom Five]: Oh thank you. Oh, since there are no customers anymore that’s apparently when you get to just walk in, because when the money’s not flowing through, Val Vesuvio doesn’t care about what’s happening here!
Julia [as Val]: Yeah.
Eric [as Dom Five]: You’re the only person in Italian history who wears a leather jacket to make pizza.
Julia [as Val]: That is blatantly untrue.
Eric [as Dom Five]: I know all of them! They do not wear - they don’t wear them!
Julia [as Val]: You know every Italian who ever existed?
Eric [as Dom Five]: Every single one! Every single Italian who’s ever been in New York State, I know them.
Julia [as Val]: Okay, okay.
Eric [as Dom Five]: Ask me about them! I know them. Ask me about them.
Julia [as Val]: I think you should watch your tone with me.
Eric [as Dom Five]: [flustered] You watch- no you watch your tone with me! Val?
Julia [as Val]: Eh?
Eric [as Dom Five]: Val?
Julia [as Val]: Eh?
Eric [as Dom Five]: I love you. Go fuck yourself.
Eric: Oh, my God. Alright. So you're working the counter today, and the pizza place is now open. And a line comes immediately because Dominic's is - It's like the Italian place. This is like the first pizzeria in the city. And they have the famous crayfish pie, which is like if you had New Haven pizza, there's like a clam pie. It's kind of like that. But instead, they use crayfish, which are also mountain lobsters.
Amanda: Has triple D visited Dominic's?
Eric: A hundred percent.
Amanda: Okay
Eric: Five thousand percent. There is - there is a [laughing] there are photos on the wall. There's one of Dom 5 and Dom 4 with Guy Fieri. And there's also one of like Sylvester Stallone and Dom 5 there. And there's just one of Al Pacino. No one else is in it.
Brandon: It's like a headshot.
[all laughing]
Amanda: Is it signed?
Eric: It's - oh a hundred percent, it’s signed.
Julia: Excellent.
Eric: It’s like, “To Doms two through five: love the place. Al Pacino.”
Amanda: Great.
Eric: Yeah. And the line starts going quickly.
Julia: You know, when you go to order a cheesesteak in Philly and there's very specific rules about how you order things?
Eric: Mhm.
Julia: It's like that where Val's like,
Julia [as Val]: Welcome to Dominic’s, what do you want? Hurry it up! You haven't even ordered yet! Hurry it up! Go to the back of the line.
Eric: Oh no! There are some tourists who are wearing LTC shirts. And it’s like
Eric [as tourist]: What's good here?
[Brandon laughing]
Julia [as Val]: Back of the line!
Eric [as tourist]: Oh no.
Julia [as Val]: Ask someone else – back of the line.
Amanda [as tourist]: Do you put pineapple on pizza, please?
Julia [as Val]: What are ya, fuckin’ new here?
[Eric laughing]
Amanda: Yeah, I just came in on the train. I took the SkyTram over here, it’s really amazing and moving. It's like the infrastructure in this- is amazing.
Julia [as Val]: Ask someone else. Ask Zagat’s. Back of the line.
Brandon [as customer]: Hey, can I get a slice?
Julia [as Val]: Yeah. Go sit down.
Brandon [as customer]: Oh shit. Uh, this is all I got.
Eric: This guy only has a dollar.
Brandon [as customer]: I already touched a slice though.
Julia [as Val]: Yeah, it’s a dollar slice. Go.
Brandon [as customer]: Alright, alright.
Eric: There’s a dollar slice and then there are other ones?!
Julia [as Val]: Of course it’s a fuckin’ dollar slice! It’s a regular slice, though!
Eric: Oh well Val’s yelling at the DM! Alright. I guess it’s a dollar slice!
Amanda: That Season 2 energy!
Eric: Yeah. One of the characters yell at the DM. It’s fine.
As you’ve been doing this for a few hours, the line really hasn't abet at all. But like everyone is working overtime.
Julia: That’s because I keep sending people back.
Eric: [laughing] Because you keep – you don’t actually end it! It’s just the same people.
Amanda: Val does not know how to operate the credit card machine.
Julia [as Val]: Learn how to order!
Julia: Val has one of those old ones where you have to like put the credit card down.
Amanda: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Eric: I want to make a Constitution saving throw for how much this takes out of you.
Amanda: Oh! Bold decision.
[dice rolling]
Julia: So it's a 6. But I add 4 to it. So it's a 10.
Eric: Okay, with a 10. Yeah, it’s taxing. You definitely were not excited to do this, and you did not wake up – you didn’t even get coffee before you got put on counter duty. So -
Julia: Ridiculous. No one brought me an espresso.
Eric: Right. And then Dom 5 sticks his head out and says,
Eric [as Dom Five]: Hey, Val, come back here.
Julia [as Val]: Alright.
Julia: Val just takes off whatever apron they threw on themselves.
Eric: Just throws it to someone else like, “Hey I was- this is a bad workplace.”
Amanda: The person in front of the line just waits.
Julia [as Val]: You wait your turn!
Eric [as customer]: Oh, ok. I guess I’ll wait my turn.
Eric: So you go to the back, and Dom 5's office is just like stuffed with Mountain Lobster memorabilia. He's a huge hockey fan. There are posters and jerseys and all these knickknacks all over his desk. There are like hockey pucks everywhere that he keeps like a stack of 10 nearby to throw at people when they say something stupid
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Julia: Dom 5 is 100% like back when his family was from the New York area,
Eric: Yeah-
Julia: They were Islanders fans.
Eric: A hundred percent. Five thousand percent.
Amanda: Really? I was picking up strong Rangers energy.
Julia [as Val]: Don’t come at me and my father figure like that!
Eric: Val, scale it back! Scale it back! Alright, so yeah Dom says
Eric [as Dom Five]: Hey, I know you only work here part time, but I - I need you to do me a favor for me.
Julia [as Val]: [quietly] Okay…
Eric [as Dom Five]: You know, the … the charity, the Lake Town- Historic Lake Town Charity auction is happening today? I need you to bid on something for me.
Julia [as Val]: Alright.
Eric [as Dom Five]: So Dom Two, his- his favorite chair is up for – is up for auction.
Julia [as Val]: His favorite chair?
Eric [as Dom Five]: His favorite chair. There is a chair that my great great grandfather Dom Two- he sat every day, every day for 50 years. He would eat there. He would watch TV there. He'd sleep there. He'd never moved. But at some point, you know, pizza, pizza places, places fuck with each other. You know, it’s a thing they do.
Julia [as Val]: Like colleges and mascots?
Eric [as Dom Five]: Yeah, similarly. It was hurtful. They did it. And it really hurt my family. It was stolen a while back, and it got lost and on auction. And, you know, my ma, she'd really like it back. And I can't go back because, you know, business and I gotta deal with these [louder] fuckin’ jamokes who I work with!
But I trust you. Can you and you go and get it? It would be really important to me. And I know that you're not usually - you can't really be doing favors for me. You know, so don't tell your dad or anything
Julia [as Val]: I’m not going to say anything.
Eric [as Dom Five]: Okay, don’t say anything.
Julia [as Val]: I mean, unless you're asking me to do something untoward, you know-
Eric [as Dom Five]: It’s fine, there’s nothing untoward.
Julia [as Val]: It's just like it's a favor between friends.
Eric [as Dom Five]: Yeah, I need you to do it.
Julia [as Val]: So you gonna give me the money, though, right? I’m not fronting you money for a chair.
Eric [as Dom Five]: Yeah I got it, no one’s fronting money! You don't have enough money for this chair, first of all. This blessed, blessed chair of my family. Thank you. So, give me your hand.
Julia [as Val]: Give me your hand?
Eric [as Dom Five]: Yeah.
Julia [as Val]: Give me your hand?
Eric [as Dom Five]: Yeah.
Julia: Val’s like,
Julia [as Val]: Alright.
Eric: So, I want you to make a dexterity saving throw.
[dice rolling]
Julia: It's a 6.
Eric: Okay, you put your hand out and immediately you have handcuffs are clipped to one of your hands.
Julia: What?
Eric: And the other side of the handcuffs is clipped to a suitcase.
Julia [as Val]: Could we have picked something a little less inconspicuous, maybe?
Eric [as Dom Five]: It's not – It’s important! Look, the money is in here.
Julia [as Val]: You think I could not just carry some money across the city? You think someone is going to fuck with me?
Eric [as Dom Five]: Listen to the way that they need to know that what you're doing is important. And then you can - as you show people the suitcase, and you shake it around, like oh that person with the suitcase, pretty cool, right? Pretty nice.
Julia [as Val]: It makes me look like I'm trying to sell secrets to the Russians.
Eric [as Dom Five]: I've – it’s rather dramatic. I'm sorry.
Eric: I want you to make a Perception check. And I'm going to say, because of the con save, I'm gonna make it a little harder in my head than it would before.
Julia: Okay, hold on I’m just writing down “handcuffed briefcase to me”
Eric: Yeah. You were-
Amanda: As if that’s stopped the mob from cutting off someone’s hand.
Julia: Yeah, because I really want my hand cut off. Thank you Dom.
Eric: I will say, Dom 5 is a regular person, so I rolled a 7
Julia: Okay, what was I rolling?
Eric: Uh, just roll a Perception check and I’m gonna make it a little more difficult than…
[dice rolling]
Julia: That’s a 19.
Amanda: Ay!
Brandon: Ay!
Eric: Nice. With a 19, I don't want to speak on behalf of yourself, but you know how heavy money is. Even if he was doing the flair for the dramatic, if he put it in tens, this is way too heavy to have a thousand dollars in it. This suitcase would - just say it's - it's not a briefcase, or it's like one of those briefcases that are like puffy. It has heft to it.
Amanda: Like I had an overnight bag.
Eric: Thank you. It's more like an overnight bag.
Amanda: Or a doctor’s bag.
Julia: It’s like a duffel bag
Eric: Thank you, It's like a doctor's bag.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: It has that leather well in it. Like there is something else in here which is very heavy.
Julia: Is it locked?
Eric: Yeah, it's locked.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: But there is a code to it. It's like one of those three – those three number codes.
Julia: Dom, if you don't want me to spend the full thousand dollars, how am I opening this up? What if I spend like two? And then like, how am I - I'm not going to give him the whole bag.
Eric [as Dom Five]: Well, I listen, I got a guy. It's at the bank. It's at First National – First National LTC down there, and I got a guy there, and he has the other key to the handcuffs.
Amanda: Oh no.
Julia: No.
Eric [as Dom Five]: He’ll pop it off you and I'll take the bag.
Julia [as Val]: Yeah, I kind of hate this. Not gonna lie.
Eric [as Dom Five]: That's why I'm sending you out there, because you're like a child to me.
Julia [as Val]: I am not a child!
Eric [as Dom Five]: But you are like my child.
Julia [as Val]: Okay.
Eric [as Dom Five]: And that's why I trust you for you to do it.
Julia [as Val]: We’re not blood.
Eric [as Dom Five]: We’re not blood, but we’re blood. We are blood. We’re sauce.
Brandon: Blood is thicker than marinara.
Julia: So now that I have this bag, you know, attached to me.
Eric: Right. You can go and you can come-
Julia: Cool, I was gonna make sure I didn't have to finish my shift –
Eric: That was me – don’t yell at the DM! I was saying you can leave. You don’t have to finish- believe me.
Amanda: So, Julia, how do you feel about Val losing their hand in Episode 1 of the podcast?
[Brandon laughing]
Julia: I can't do as many punches if I lose a hand!
Eric: I will say that for action's sake, there's no penalties on this. You'll be fine for game mechanics.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So Dom sends you home now.
Julia: Val just pieces, she’s like
Julia [as Val]: You’re paying me for the whole shift! Bye!
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: So Val can go home. And for everybody here, the auction is at First National, which is downtown. It's actually very close to where the Futurism Museum, the main museum is also downtown.
Brandon: MMFFC.
Eric: MMFFC is also downtown. It's all at 8. So you guys can just like do whatever you want until then. So do - do any of you want to do anything else?
Julia: I'd like to go visit my mom.
Eric: Sure, go ahead.
Julia: Yeah, I think my mom's probably still living in Lake Town proper – Historic Lake Town.
Eric: Yeah, definitely.
Julia: And has like an art studio there, and is very hippy-dippy-ish.
Eric: Oh definitely.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Like over a shop on Main Street?
Julia: Yeah. Something like that. Like a studio. I am also going to make sure to text her to make sure she is alone, because that has been a problem in the past.
Amanda: Oh!
[Eric laughs]
Julia [as Val]: Hey, I'm coming over. Do you want anything? Also, do I need to bring extra for anyone else?
Eric [as Val’s mom]: No. Give me … an hour.
Julia [as Val]: Goddamnit. Just tell me what you want. I'll have ready.
Eric [as Val’s mom]: Just bring pasta. Whatever. I trust you.
Julia [as Val]: Alright.
Eric: Rosa Vesuvio also lives in one of the other bungalows in Historic Lake Town, because she also was part of the Lake Town Historic District. She was living there for a while during similar times. Actually, Aggie, you might probably know her.
Amanda: Yeah. I know everybody around town.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: She makes ceramics. You probably have like a couple of mugs or something from her.
Amanda: Yeah, sure.
Eric: You go home and you knock on the door and Rosa is wrapped in a silk kimono. You know, just cause. It's not, it's not new. It's not different.
Julia: Sure mom.
Eric: She just is. So Rosa, is - Everyone here, all of the characters are like 28, 29, 30. And I think Rosa is like 50. But she looks like your sister. Like she looks like she's 30.
Amanda: What a fun thing for one's parents.
Julia: Super hot. Thanks mom.
Eric: She’s like
Eric [as Rosa]: Val! Come on in! Val! Come on in!
Julia: Give her a big kiss on the cheek, bring take out bags like,
Julia [as Val]: They had the butternut squash ravioli that you like.
Eric [as Rosa]: Thank you. Thank you.
Julia [as Val]: I know. It’s got that sage butter sauce.
Eric [as Rosa]: Thank you. Come in! Come in!
Eric: And you go into the art studio. She has sculpture- she was a sculptor. She used to live in New York City, but now she lives in Lake Town, in one of the old - one of the bungalows. And she does like sculptures everywhere. And they're all very provocative.
Amanda: Oh no.
Julia: They’re very horny.
Eric: They’re all so horny.
Julia: I pick up a mug that definitely has a nipple on it and just like take a sip.
Amanda: Is that like her stamp on the bottom of all of her ceramics? It’s like, “Is that a nipple?”
Eric: All over her ceramics don't really stay, because they all have a nipple on the bottom.
Amanda: Great.
Julia: It’s very weirdly balanced.
Eric: Yeah. So she doesn't make mugs anymore.
Brandon: This sucks.
Eric: Rosa – [laughs]
Julia: You talking shit about my mom?
Eric: Yeah, don’t talk shit about her mom! She says,
Eric [as Rosa]: I love your suitcase. Is that a new style?
Julia [as Val]: Yes.
Eric [as Rosa]: That's nice. You know, when I see my child walk in with a suitcase strapped to their wrist, I might think about what that job might be, but I'm not going to think about them because Val, my Val, doesn't do anything like that.
Julia [as Val]: Nah, mom, not at all.
Eric [as Rosa]: That would require suitcases strapped to her- anything with, you know, any people or families their own whereof in any sort of city-
Julia [as Val]: Nah mom.
Eric [as Rosa]: You know, New York City or Lake Town City, thereof. I'm glad they're not doing it, so I don't have to worry about it!
Julia [as Val]: Mhm!
Eric: She goes back over to just like a super horny sculpture.
Amanda: That doesn’t really narrow it down.
Eric: This is - like it's just like legs. And then you look at it like, oh, look at all these legs. And there are just like nipples at the bottom.
Brandon: I hate this. I want to play in this space.
Eric: Don't talk to Rosa.
Julia: I was just like,
Julia [as Val]: That's a nice one. It's a nice one. Is it marble? Or…
Eric [as Rosa]: Thank you. It’s multimedia. I won't tell you what they are.
Julia [as Val]: I'll be able to tell once it's a finished project, you know?
Eric [as Rosa]: Yeah. Alright. So uh…What's the suitcase for?
Julia [as Val]: I'm going to go to an auction tonight in a bid on a chair.
Eric [as Rosa]: Huh! Alright.
Julia [as Val]: Nothing- nothing wrong or illegal about that, ma. It's just a chair and some money.
Eric [as Rosa]: Okay, that’s how it always starts!
Julia [as Val]: No! No!
Eric [as Rosa]: You know, when I was with your father-
Julia [as Val]: We’ve had this conversation before!
Eric [as Rosa]: When I was with your father, he would always - he would always say just going out to meet a guy about a chair. And I'm like, oh, must be a chair. And then it wasn’t a chair. It was guns!
[all laughing]
Julia [as Val]: This one is chair. I promise, it's just a chair. You can go ask Dom. He gave me half the day off. He also competed this butternut squash ravioli. He doesn't know about that, though.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric [as Rosa]: Oh, It's not a comp if they don't know.
Julia [as Val]: No, it totally is a comp.
Eric [as Rosa]: Oh, that’s not how it works.
Julia [as Val]: That is how it works.
Amanda: It’s a self-serve comp.
Julia [as Val]: It’s a self-serve comp.
Eric [as Rosa]: Alright. Okay.
Julia [as Val]: One of the boys put it in the thing, and it was supposed to be to-go for someone else, but now it's not to-go for someone else, it’s to-go for me.
Eric [as Rosa]: Well, you know, if it was if there was something you would tell me, right?
Julia [as Val]: I would tell you, mom. You know, I tell you everything.
Eric [as Rosa]: Okay.
Julia [as Val]: Just like I know all about your endeavors.
Eric [as Rosa]: Yeah.
Brandon: I want to die.
Eric [as Rosa]: Let's come up with a different word for those.
Julia [as Val]: You don’t like “endeavors”? It's one of the words I learned at SUNY Lake Town City.
Eric [as Rosa]: Oh, big - oh, college person. Educate - all the educated to come in here and use five-dollar words about my - my dalliances.
Julia [as Val]: Listen, my communications degree has to work for something.
Eric [as Rosa]: Okay, okay fine. So, you know, it's plaster on the outside, but inside there's fruit.
Julia [as Val]: Oh, is that gonna last a while?
Eric [as Rosa]: That's the art.
Julia [as Val]: Or are you gonna like… Is it like a, like a, like a sarcophagus for the fruit?
Eric [as Rosa]: Exactly.
Julia [as Val]: Oh my God. I love it.
Eric [as Rosa]: But it’s legs.
Julia [as Val]: I love it ma.
Eric: Aggie and Milo, do you want to do anything with your afternoon?
Brandon: I convince Mr. Brewpot to let me take the interns to a team building exercise.
Amanda: Oh!
[Eric laughing]
Brandon: So we’re gonna take a few hours, just an hour or two off early, because the last tour we have in the day ended up canceling. There's only two people – and two or less we usually cancel.
Eric: Sure.
Brandon: And so we're gonna go over to Astro Lane and do some bowling, because Milo, he’s-
Eric: Always loves to cut out and do some bowling.
Brandon: He’s a bowler. He's on a bowling team and he goes there all the time, so he gets a pretty hefty discount.
Amanda: Gotta get those reps in.
Brandon: Yeah. He gets special treatment from all the managers there.
Brandon [as Milo]: Alright, Which - which one are you over twenty-one? Don't lie to me.
Eric [as intern]: Me.
Brandon [as Milo]: Jenny.
Julia [as intern]: My Vermont I.D. says I'm over 21…
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, no alcohol for you!
Eric [as intern]: My New Mexico I.D. says I'm twenty-five.
Brandon [as Milo]: Also no alcohol for you!
Amanda [as intern]: In New Hampshire, I am 30.
Brandon [as Milo]: I… sure. Do you have an I.D.?
Amanda [as intern]: They don't require them in New Hampshire. Live free or die.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay.
Amanda [as intern]: Don't oppress me.
Brandon [as Milo]: Gotcha. So no alcohol for anyone. Alright, let's go bowl!
Eric: Yeah, you go up to the counter. This guy, McHenry who's your friend, is working the shoes today. Like,
Eric [as McHenry]: Hey, fun fact. Did you know that the Blues Brothers movie from 1980 set the record for most cars destroyed in a movie production for what - at 103 cars, and that record was set for 18 years until the sequel Blues Brothers 2000 wrecked 104 cars. Did you know?
Brandon [as Milo]: I did not know. Did you know, though, Jake Gyllenhaal auditioned to play Frodo in Lord of the Rings?
Eric [as McHenry]: I did know that.
Brandon [as Milo]: What, how do you know that?
Eric [as McHenry]: I know everything. Now you know what we can learn from this?
Brandon [as Milo]: What?
Eric [as McHenry]: When you do something that is more than anybody else, the only person who can up it is yourself. So depend on yourself. There you go.
Brandon [as Milo]: I love it. What a good motto. Do you have the, um, my shoes?
Eric [as McHenry]: I do.
Brandon [as Milo]: Great.
Eric [as McHenry]: They're right here. They've been here the whole time.
Brandon [as Milo]: You didn't let anyone use them, right?
Eric [as McHenry]: No, they're your shoes. That's why you said these are your shoes. And I have your ball and-
Brandon [as Milo]: You he didn't let anyone use them, did you?
Eric [as McHenry]: No, I didn’t let anyone use the shoes.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay.
Eric: So what – what’s the designs in your bowling ball?
Brandon: So one of the lanes at Astro Lane is themed after LAGO*, which is the gigantic interferometer which detects gravitational waves.
Amanda: I thought you said Lego, and I was so excited about a Lego paved bowling lane, which now I want to make.
Brandon: That could be one of the lanes, yeah.
Eric: I like how the lanes are all themed differently.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: That's cool.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I think it's cool.
Brandon: And so that's his favorite line at this particular Astro Lane. So at this particular Astro Lane, his ball and he uses it just - it's solid black, and it's the black hole. It's a black hole.
[all laughing]
So when he hits the pins, they're also all solid black. So it's like two black holes colliding. And that's –
Eric: That's cool!
Brandon: And that's how they detect gravitational waves.
Julia: Milo’s such a big nerd.
Amanda: Aw, Milo.
Eric: It’s great. Alright, yeah, I like how you've just done this, and the interns are ostensibly there, but you're just like bowling. You might as well just be bowling – are you just bowling in a different lane while the interns are bowling in a different lane?
Brandon: Yeah. I don't need to team build. They need to team build.
Amanda: I don’t need to build a team.
Brandon: Yeah, I have like a match I need to get-
Eric: You’re definitely part of a bowling tournament.
Brandon: Yeah, with folks at the MMFFC as well.
Eric: Oh for sure. Yeah, all the fuckin’- it's like the science nerd bowling league.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah, definitely.
Brandon: We're pretty good, though. Don't –
Eric: I wouldn't doubt that, 100%. So yeah, you’re just bowling-
Amanda: It’s all physics! It’s all physics!
Eric: You’re just bowling at this point, like you're about to a bowl and other a frame and then Tuna just like pokes their head out of the bowling ball like,
Eric [as Tuna]: Hey, what are you doing?
Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna, I know you can't get hurt by this bowling ball, but I can.
Eric [as Tuna]: That's fair. Then don't throw it because your best friend Tuna is on top- is on top of the ball.
Eric: And now he’s just like a cat just laying on top of a ball.
Brandon [as Milo]: Tuna, do you remember when you couldn't do the thing that you wanted to do and you bounced off the container in the museum? That was really funny.
Eric [as Tuna]: Why would you mention that?
Brandon [as Milo]: It was pretty funny.
Eric [as Tuna]: That was so horrible.
Brandon [as Milo]: I've never seen you fail except for like in life when you fail every day.
Eric [as Tuna]: Listen- [sighs] Why would you bring up - why would you bring up the time that I got run over by the truck? Why would you do that? Your dad was so pissed.
Brandon [as Milo]: Sure. Yeah. He liked you.
Eric [as Tuna]: Yeah. He cried for three days.
Brandon [as Milo]: Right. I saw it.
Eric [as Tuna]: You saw it.
Brandon [as Milo]: I did.
Eric [as Tuna]: So why would you bring that up?
Brandon [as Milo]: I… Well, now that you're back…
Eric [as Tuna]: When I go to sleep at night, I still see tire tracks.
Brandon [as Milo]: A little funny.
Amanda: Oh, no.
Eric [as Tuna]: It's hurtful.
Brandon [as Milo]: It's a little funny. Do you want a nacho?
Eric [as Tuna]: I would love it. Hey. Yes, I would love a nacho.
Brandon [as Milo]: Great.
Brandon: And I feed Tuna a nacho.
Amanda: Can Tuna eat?
Eric: Tuna cannot eat. He tried to eat it, but I think it was a little distracting. Their cat brain took over like, “Oh? Treat?”
Eric [as Tuna]: Hey, Milo, you're smart, you’re a smart kid. You're, you know, math and things.
Brandon [as Milo]: Twenty-nine, not a kid.
Eric [as Tuna]: But I'm just a cat, so I don't know math. What does one plus … what's 1 + 0?
Brandon [as Milo]: 1.
Eric [as Tuna]: 1. So before today, the only - only spirit that you'd been able to talk to is me.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, shit.
Eric [as Tuna]: Wha- Well, what is the whole point of this having secret, speaking to ghost powers, if you're not stoked about more people talking to you?
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, you're right. Uh… Tonight, when we go back after we get that key… Look, I know… I know maybe we don’t trust each other 100 percent.
Eric [as Tuna]: What are you talking about?
Eric: The cat has now flopped on your face.
Brandon [as Milo]: But we're kind of stuck together. So maybe if maybe if I got your back, you got my back?
Eric [as Tuna]: Yeah. I mean, whatever a ghost cat can do. You know, this wild world like this.
Brandon [as Milo]: Okay, great. Alright. Thanks.
Eric [as Tuna]: So do you have any money?
Brandon [as Milo]: Are you looking for money?
Eric [as Tuna]: No, I meant to buy things at the auction.
Brandon [as Milo]: Yeah, I got the money from Mr. Brewpot.
Eric [as Tuna]: Yeah, but aren’t the notes gonna be $500?
Brandon [as Milo]: Fuck.
Eric: Cut away from Milo.
[Amanda laughing]
Aggie, do you want to do anything before the auction?
Amanda: Yeah, I think after my day of picking up excessive litter that the kids left all around the lake and up and down Main Street, I stopped in to Mountain News to get a couple like crossword books, and maybe a couple bagels, and brought it over to the Ropers just to say hello, and listen to a little bit, tell her about my other siblings and just, you know, spend a little time. And then headed back to my bungalow where I sat at the kitchen table and looked at Tegan’s business card for 25 minutes before deciding what to do.
Eric: Mhm.
[dice rolls]
Eric: Alright, you get an email on your beeper.
Amanda: The words, “email on your beeper” is just such a satisfying combination of words.
Eric: It looks like someone is putting a piece of mail in a mailbox, and you put the mail up and this is like your Lake Town City government email and it's from Tegan.Murphy@averagebear.com.
Eric [as Tegan]: Hey. Just wanted to say hi. I’m Tegan, the one with the turquoise jacket. If you don’t want to talk to me, that’s fine, but there’s this cool quiz you can take to see if you want to get to know… just for fun, so you know that we’re a real thing.
Eric: And Amanda, I'm going to send you a quiz.
Amanda: Oh, my.
Julia: Can you send it to all of us so we can all see it?
Eric: Yeah. It is called “Go to the deli and we'll give you a superpower.”
Julia: Love it!
Amanda: Wait, it's by you.
Eric: Yeah, I made it!
Amanda: Oh, shit.
Julia: That is so cool.
[Brandon laughing]
Eric: You guys can take it. Everyone can take it. We're gonna post up the link to this in the episode description. First question, why are you going to the deli?
Amanda: I need milk!
Eric: Choose something to order.
Amanda: I think bagel.
Eric: Nice. Choose a drink.
Amanda: Gotta do the Arizona iced tea.
Eric: Nice. Choose a snack.
Amanda: Popcorn.
Eric: Nice. And then what did you get?
Amanda: I got the power super strength. “You know, the funny thing is, I bet you forgot to cancel your planet fitness membership. Why would you need it now?”
Julia: That's very funny.
Amanda: Aggie sits back, looks at the results and kind of does a little like half smile. Brandon, what did you get?
Brandon: I got the power of flight.
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: I have the ability to fly over any and everything without touching the surface or ground.
Amanda: Cool.
Brandon: And apparently, there’s a photo of a plane, so I turn into a jet.
Eric: There you go.
Julia: Love it.
Amanda: Julia, what’d you get?
Julia: I also got super strength.
Amanda: Ooh. Aggie smiles and writes back,
Amanda [as Aggie]: Of course, I remember your jacket. Really nice to meet you. If you want to get a taste of the true Lake Town City, you don't have anything to do in this small town on a Thursday night, come by the action!
Amanda: I’ll include a link to the like auction event site with like the venue and the time and everything, and then “ - Aggie.” And then at the bottom in parentheses I say strength.
Eric: Nice. Tegan emails you back after a few minutes and says,
Eric [as Tegan]: I have no friends here, so that’s better than drinking at an Astros. I will see you there. I’ll be the one in the turquoise jacket.
Eric: And below that, they write,
Eric [as Tegan]: Invisibility.
Amanda: I reply,
Amanda [as Aggie]: Oh, we will definitely end up at Astros.
Eric: Alright.
Julia: Oh, flirty!
Eric: I didn't know you were flirting with Tegan! Oh!
Amanda: What do you want? Putting someone in a teal leather jacket in front of me in Episode 1?
Julia: Amanda is getting the claim early.
Eric: I don’t know-
Amanda: Aggie also has some game despite the appearances, but Aggie definitely does change into a darker denim shirt for this auction, brushes her hair a little bit, makes sure sushi is as comfortable and then lint rolls her work pants, makes sure it's all spiffy.
Brandon: Best part about ghost cat? No, lint rolling.
Amanda: I’m so fucking jealous. You don’t have to rub it in.
Eric: Sushi walks over to you and goes “Meow.”
Amanda: And I pet Sushi on his little head.
Eric: And that's all Sushi can do, because Sushi is a regular cat.
[all laughing]
Julia: Waiting for sushi to talk.
Eric: And Sushi goes, “Oh it's nice to meet you.” Um-
Julia: God, I hope someone awakens Sushi at some point.
Amanda: I hope so too.
Eric: Science experiment on Sushi.
Amanda: Aggie makes meatless burgers for dinner because she cares about climate change, and then drives over to the auction venue… it's this at the town hall?
Eric: No, this is in - at First National LTC.
Amanda: Oh, right.
Eric: It's such a big bank that there's actually an auction hall in it, so they hold auctions there.
Amanda: Damn. Cool, so she'll head down a little early. And since this is to benefit Lake Town City, like there are like trustees of the charity and stuff - that's not Aggie's job- but she does want to be on hand, just in case, you know, she needs anything.
Eric: Yeah. You are supposed to be like the representative of - because this is a benefit for maintaining a Historic Lake Town City. It’s also just like, you know, it's the thing that the city is proud of. They like that there is a historic district, and it's a historic benefit. Like it's supposed to be about like owning and selling artifacts from the past. So that's why all the stuff that we've talked about is there.
Amanda: Yeah. And I bring some pamphlets about the Museum, the Living History Museum, and leave them out on this sort of front stage.
Julia: Is there a dress code at this event?
Eric: You assume it is a formal event, but there is no dress code because it is an auction.
Julia: I feel like my mother would have insisted that I put on like a collared shirt and a tie.
Eric: Sure.
Julia: Over the band T-shirt.
Eric: 100%, 100%.
Julia: The leather jacket is still on. The jeans are still ripped.
Eric: It's definitely like a white shirt, so you can still see the band shirt underneath.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah. Does Milo run home?
Brandon: Yeah. Milo, immediately after he figures out that he needs some money, carefully puts his shoes and ball back in their homes.
Eric: McKennery gives you a salute.
Brandon: Yep. Grab some last nachos on the way out, run home real fast, and he is searching around the apartment for something that he can sell in this auction so we can get some funds fast.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: And I mean, obviously we know it's - it's a historic artifact auction, but the only thing he could find is his towel that Douglas Adams signed
[all laughing]
- when Douglas Adams came into town. And so he grabs the towel and runs off to the auction, and tries to get into the back and try to get this entered into the auction
Eric: So everyone comes – Aggie, you're kind of like the delegation, and you're watching everything get set up, you’re shaking hands.
Val, you walk in with a [laughing] suitcase strapped to you. And let's go with Milo as you go up - I guess there's like a director or someone who's running the auction, and like the auctioneer and they're talking.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: So you can go up to them.
Brandon: Milo hurries up to them, kind of faking being a little bit out of breath.
Brandon [as Milo]: Oh, my God, y'all. I'm so sorry. I forgot - I forgot to bring this. I forgot to enter this. This is last minute. Is there any chance I can get us into the auction last minute? This is a - this is a real towel. Get it? It’s a towel? Signed by Douglas Adams. It’s when he came to town and he took the people…People-walkers. That was what he took - he signed on the way out.
It was the mover of the future, so Douglas Adams came to test the people movers, and then on the way out he signed a towel for the city. And this is the towel.
Julia: This is how Douglas Adams died.
Amanda: Yes. That’s a super tenuous connection, and I respect the hell out of it.
Eric: Yeah, I do like that. Why don't you roll Deception? with advantage? Because that was very good.
Brandon: I have negative one deception.
Julia: Of course you do. You’re just a very honest person.
[dice rolling]
Brandon: First one, 17. Second one 15, so 17 – 1 is 16.
Eric: Okay, I think with a 16…
Brandon [as Milo]: I'm happy to pay any late fees. I know this is last minute and I would really, really appreciate it. I- I know y’all would be doing me a favor, but I just want this to go to the person who wants it most. And right now, it’s just sitting in my - my closet and I don't feel like I'm getting the most out of it.
Eric: They cura- the director and the auctioneer look at over, and say,
Eric [as director]: You know, this is a - it's a benefit charity. Half of it, 50 percent will go to Historic Lake Town. We will give you the remaining 50% after the late fees are deducted from it.
Brandon [as Milo]: I'm happy to give 60! Just as a thank you.
Eric [as director]: Oh, six- six-? Alright. Great. Sixty. Sixty minus late fees, and you can take the rest. That's absolutely- thank you, sir.
Brandon [as Milo]: No, thank you. I really appreciate it.
Eric [as director]: This towel… This is weird.
Brandon [as Milo]: I mean, Douglas Adams, you know right?
Eric [as director]: But so is history.
Eric: Then they walk out where they entered. Alright, you have the towel You have the towel entered in.
Brandon: Sweet.
Eric: Absolutely. Cool.
Brandon: Nailed it.
Eric: Alright, so now they take the towel from you and they put it, like in the – where all the stuff is. This is also, like people get to look everything over before they bid on it, so there's a whole display – this is a very large room. It's like if a bank had an event space, what it would look like. So it's very ornate. There's a lot of hard, dark wood everywhere. This is for auctions, so like they have permanent shelving to put stuff, and they have like a very, very nice stage and podium, because they have auctions. And I want all of you to make Perception checks.
Brandon: And not that anyone asked, but yes, I am wearing the tie underneath my pullover.
Eric: Thank you.
Amanda: I got an 8 because Aggie is extremely distracted looking out for Tegan’s jacket.
Brandon: I got 11 + 5 for 16.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: I got a flat 16.
Eric: Okay, both of you with 16, you see the items you're looking for. There is this very ornate wrought iron key, like it’s oversized. It's the size of your forearm. And on the placard under it says, “Dr. Morrow, emergency science key.”
[all laughing]
Amanda: Is that engraved on it?
Eric: “Emergency” is etched into it. It has like four loops on the - on the end. And it's like very large and you have to turn it really large, and it fits the large keyhole, which is on the apparatus back at the museum.
Brandon: And I say,
Brandon [as Milo]: Man, I sure hope there are some tuna or … hors d’oeuvres here at this here auction. I love tuna!
Eric: Tuna appears on your shoulder and says,
Eric [as Tuna]: What? I was taking a catnap. Get it? Because I'm a cat.
Brandon [as Milo]: God, I hate you. That's the key. Make sure we get it. Okay? Honestly…
Eric [as Tuna]: What do you want? What do you want me to do?
Brandon [as Milo]: Well, I'll bid- I’ll bid it, but, you know, someone like tries to raise a paddle, like maybe you swat their paddle out.
Eric [as Tuna]: I’ll do - I don't know if I can do that, but I'll do my best.
Brandon [as Milo]: I know you can.
Eric [as Tuna]: Because I like causing mischief.
Eric: And then he disappears. Val, you see the chair. It is this very, very overstuffed armchair. It's leather, but it's like stained. It's definitely old. And you can only imagine it has - this is Dominic Toretto, the second’s armchair.
Amanda: Toretto?
Julia: You are not gonna name him that.
Eric: I will. I just did. I just did. And it says Dom Two's chair. The placard goes on, it says, this is the armchair of Dom Two, the second proprietor of Dominic's historic pizza place.
With a six, there's just a lot of Historic Lake Town memorabilia and nothing really catches your eye.
Amanda: Yeah, I think I'll probably get lost in the memories a little bit as I identify things that I saw growing up from people's houses or town, and it's just nice. But I kind of alternate between looking at the exhibits and looking up and sort of looking for that jacket.
Eric: Mhm. While everyone is kind of like getting seated, you see that Tegan slips in in the back and they're still wearing their turquoise jacket. And they wave to you.
Amanda: And I give them a little nod.
Eric: But everyone is getting shushed. Where do you two sit?
Brandon: Um, Milo's going to sit like, in the third row off-center.
Eric: Eager but inconspicuous.
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: Val, where do you sit?
Julia: Towards the back and like not, you know how like they probably have the center aisle? Probably on the other side, on the side aisle. Easy escape access.
Amanda: Easy escape.
Amanda: And Aggie’s going to stand down at the bottom by the side of the stage, arms crossed or in pockets and just kind of chillin’ against the wall in case anything last minute comes up.
Eric: Yeah, at one point they’re like,
Eric [as auctioneer]: And we have Aggie O’Hare, custodian of Historic Lake Town, who is so happy that everyone is here to bid on these items and support the maintenance of the city for Historic Lake Town. Everyone gives it up for Aggie.
Eric: And there’s light applause.
Amanda: I sort of bow my head a little bit and give an embarrassed wave.
Eric: Alright, so the auctioneer steps up to the microphone. He says,
Eric [as auctioneer]: The first item up for bid is Dominic Toretto the Second's historic armchair.
Julia: Through the back, you just hear Val go,
Julia [as Val]: Boo!
[all laughing]
Brandon [as Milo]: I didn’t know this was a booing place, alright.
Julia [as Val]: Dommy Two!
Eric: Dom Two! That’s his chair!
Eric [as auctioneer]: Alright, we're to start the bidding at $500.
Julia [as Val]: For a chair?!
Eric [as auctioneer]: This is a piece of Lake Town City history. It’s gonna start at $500. Can I get 500? Have 500. Can I get 550?
Eric: And someone raises, and it goes all the way up to 750.
Julia: Okay. At like 700, Val likes finding the person in the crowd that’s bidding against them, and like just dead eyes. And like just dead eyes.
Eric: Alright, make an Intimidation check.
Julia: I’m good at that.
Amanda: Fabulous.
Julia: It's a 19 plus 3, so a 22.
All: Ooh!
Brandon: Everyone leaves the room.
Eric: So the person who you're bidding - they're - a bunch of people are bidding, and they go back, and I think it's 750. You just [giggles] - you - you're just dead-eyeing this man in a top hat.
Julia: Oh!
Eric: He’s just like,
Eric [as attendee]: Oh, okay, never mind.
Eric: Oh, yeah. With 22 it stops at 750. They're wholly intimidated. So the auctioneers look around, say,
Eric [as auctioneer]: Alright, I got 750 for this chair. I have 750 pieces of Lake Town history. It's pizza - it's pizza royalty. Can I get one? Anyone? 750. 750…Anyone? Anyone. 750.
Eric: I want everyone to make Perception checks, and Val, I want you to do it with disadvantage because you are just keyed into this auction.
Amanda: Non-Natural 20.
Julia: I rolled a 4 twice.
Eric: Ay!
Brandon: I only got 3 + 5 for 8.
Eric: Okay, um.
Brandon: I'm on my phone.
Eric: You're like, I'm just going to wait for the key to come. Aggie, you're kind of bored by all of this. And you look out the window, and you see that a van pulls up in front of First National, and four guys hop out of the back, and they're all wearing the Mountain Lobster masks that you get from the welcome center when you enter Lake Town City. And they're just trucking it into the building, just running as fast as they can.
Amanda: Aggie’s standing by the emergency exit, which leads - it's like a nondescript door down the block from the main entrance of the bank. It's like lateral, you know, like long against the street. So without thinking, she pushes the door open, slips out, puts her hand on her hip. Doesn’t have a gun there, but just wants to seem as if it does. And in her hand is the walking stick that she carries around. And she runs toward the hooligans, yelling,
Amanda [as Aggie]: Stop right there if you know what's good for you.
Julia: Definitely hooligans.
Eric: Okay, I want you to make an Intimidation check.
Brandon: Mountain hooligans.
[dice rolling]
I got a 19 - 1 for 18.
Eric: Nice, okay.
Julia: You have negative intimidation…
Eric: So one of the - one of the guys who are running, the one in the back turns around and says,
Eric [as hooligan]: What?
Eric: And as the other three run into the bank, and take a hard right, which is the way towards the auction. So one of them is - one of them is stopped and is talking to you.
Eric [as hooligan]: What do you-n What would be good for me?
Amanda [as Aggie]: Not doing whatever you are planning to do right now.
Eric [as hooligan]: Uhhhh… hmm…
Eric: The thug in the mask takes a step towards you, and sees he's also holding what seems to be a walking stick, and he presses a button on it and it just gets electrified. And he says,
Eric [as hooligan]: Excuse me, lady, I think you need to back off if you know what's good for you.
Amanda [as Aggie]: [scoffs] You clearly don’t know who I am.
Eric [as hooligan]: Oh and who are you? The denim shirt protector of the bank? Are you a security lady?
Amanda [as Aggie]: You could say that, but right now, mostly I'm here to fuck up your day.
[Eric laughs]
Amanda: Aggie strikes out with her staff to disarm him.
Eric: Make an Attack roll.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: 13.
Eric: Alright, 13 does not do it.
Amanda: My feat is lucky, which means that I can spend a lucky point to reroll a roll. So I’m going to go ahead and do that now.
Eric: Alright, do it. All right.
Julia: [chanting] Luck point! Luck point!
[dice rolling]
Eric: Hot damn.
Amanda: 18 + 5 for 23.
Julia: Yes!
Eric: Yeah, you swing at this guy, and you crack him right in the mountain lobster face. If you want, you can- instead of doing damage, you can knock it out of his hand.
Amanda: Yes, I would like to knock it out of his hand. And if it knocks his mask on its way down, then great.
Eric: So, yeah, you knock the electrified stick out of his hand and he's like,
Eric [as hooligan]: Oh, no.
Eric: And he runs away into the bank. And I give you I'm gonna give you an opportunity to attack.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: Just a 9.
Eric: Okay, so again, you try to swing on him again, but he's already inside.
Milo and Val, inside of the auction space. The auctioneer is now counting. He’s like,
Eric [as auctioneer]: Alright. Well, one last call I got one- one on 750 for there-
Julia [as Val]: Just give me the fucking chair, come on.
Eric [as auctioneer]: Two for 750, Three for 750 for the chair, alright and it’s sold! To the person in the leather jacket.
Eric: And I want both of you to make the Constitution. saving throws.
Amanda: Oh.
[dice rolling]
Amanda: So I had 8 + 4 for a 12.
Eric: Okay.
Brandon: I had 12 total as well.
Eric: Okay
Amanda: Twinsies!
Eric: So you'd both you with a 12, you hear like clink, clink, clink of metal on marble, and then boom!
[suspenseful action music plays]
As a flash bang grenade goes off and blinds all of the people inside. But you two are not blinded. You are able to resist that.
And the four jamokes that Aggie met outside, they kick their way into the auction hall and say,
Eric [as hooligan]: All right, this is a stick up. We're taking all this stuff back because it's ours! And I want all of us to roll Initiative.
[music fades]

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Intro Music
Amanda: Hi. I'm Amanda McLoughlin. I'm a co-host and co-producer of Join the Party.
Eric: Hello. I'm Eric Silver, the dungeon master of Join the Party.
Amanda: And we're here to explain a little bit about Dungeons and Dragons for those of you who are not familiar starting with, “Eric, what's Dungeons and Dragons?”
Eric: Well, Dungeons and Dragons is a role-playing game, where a bunch of people sit around a table, have fun, talk to each other, encounter wonderful adventures that is usually dictated by a dungeon master who has some sort of story prepared for the characters to participate in.
Amanda: And why are we using D&D to tell a story?
Eric: Dungeons and Dragons allows you to tell a story, but, also, you're playing a game. And, also, you're hanging out with your friends. If you were to sit around like you're on a camping trip or like a road trip and people were like, “Okay. Let's tell a story.” How would that even happen? It's so difficult to just go --
Amanda: It’s embarrassing.
Eric: Yeah, you would just, like, pull things from your brain and try to do it as much as possible. But there is a game system to kind of facilitate that. And you get to play as an adventurer or as a hero. It is all about playing in, like, heightened space where you get to make choices that is, like, set – it doesn't necessarily need to be in fantasy. But it's usually set in a fantasy setting. Very Lord of the Rings. I'm going to go do this quest with my allies, and we're going to defeat a bad guy.
Amanda: And what is the relationship like as we play the game between the DM, yourself, and the players?
Eric: Right. So, DM stands for Dungeon Master, which is what we said before. The players get to control the main characters. Think of this like your protagonists, your heroes. Again, we're using Lord of the Rings as a jumping off point. This is like Aragorn, and Gimli, and the elf boy, but, also, Frodo and Sam Wise. You can be any sort of character. It's more about like, if you think of it as like a movie, the cameras following that character. Or, if you're thinking about this like a comic book, like we are, or a novel, we're following that character's perspectives.
Amanda: Yeah, you can be a relatively normal person, but be thrust into an adventure. And then, on the adventure, you learn things, and grow, and defeat stuff. And you're on some kind of journey that is cinematic and exciting.
Eric: Right. But the fact is that they're following that one character means like, in a novel, you get that character's perspective. And you're following the adventures of that particular character. So, the players have one character, and they're sticking with them. On the other hand, the dungeon master, who's usually the person with, like, a screen in front of them, or laptop, or lots of books, plans out an idea or a story to start with and kind of, like, sets the stage. If we are – this is all kind of happening in our imagination. The Dungeon Master lays out the setting and the hook, but the players get to do whatever they want, because it is a collaborative story being told together.
Amanda: I always think of it like your school just renovated the playground, and then they open the gates, and everyone stands there. And they're so excited. And the principal is like, “Waaa! I can't wait.” And then the kids run in and maybe they're gonna use the seesaw as a catapult instead of as a seesaw. And maybe they're going to, like, make the swings go in weird directions or totally ignore one of the things because it doesn't interest them. And you come in with your playground. And then the way that we use things, the directions we go – if we turn around and run in the different direction, that is the element of, like, improvisation and characters and players being able to make whatever decision they want within the world that the DM creates.
Eric: The other element of improvisation and difference is the dice. So, ordinarily, we use a 20-sided dice for a lot of things in Dungeons and Dragons. That number scale – like, it feels like a lot of sides, but, honestly, you need the one to the 20 to dictate how well something goes. That dice represents, like, the whims of fate, like how good do you do something regardless of – like, you can be an athlete. And you could decide. You're like, “Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go jump as far as I can.” And, ordinarily, you do really well at that jump. But, like, you also might have tripped on a rock on the way out. And you do something poorly. Or you've jumped better than you've ever jumped before. It's kind of that – the element of chance that is a part of life. The unfeeling faces of the dice also have something to say about how the story goes.
Amanda: Right. So, instead of your friend who is being your Dungeon Master being like, “Umm, I don't think you're gonna make that jump,” you have a third party that is truly neutral and random telling you like, “Okay. Well, maybe you're pretty good at jumping and athletics.” And you can bring your skills to bear, which we're gonna talk about in a second. But, still, if you roll badly, it's gonna go badly. And, if you roll medium, you add a little bit of expertise that you have, but it's still not exactly what you want to happen. And you'll hear us talk about natural ones and natural 20s. All you have to know is a natural one is like, on a scale of one to 20, it's a one. It's the worst that could possibly have happened and not just you trip on a rock, but maybe you actually injure yourself. And a 20 is the best it could ever be. You leap onto the rooftop. You discover something you need. You leap over two rooftops, you know. And the player and the dungeon master together in both situations, depending on the group or your style or what you want to do, you guys collaborate on what happens next.
Eric: You also need kind of that tension of failure. Like, Amanda, you told me this story. When you first saw your brother playing Dungeons and Dragons, you're like, “Oh, that must be so boring, where you just say what you do and then you do it.”
Amanda: But games, I hear, are not fun unless there is challenge. And --
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: So, it is important that not everything goes perfectly well every time. That means that you have to try different things. If you can't jump over it, maybe you can go around it. If you aren't able to get somebody to do what you want, maybe you trick them into doing it. Maybe you pick their pocket. There's a lot of different problem solving elements that come into play.
Eric: Yeah. And there's also a reason why the dice doesn't just have one and 20s. Like, you need the in between. Sometimes, things go okay or then there's a consequence. And that's how the story kind of progresses instead of just people making things up whenever they want.
Amanda: Tell us a little bit about abilities. So, you'll hear on mic Eric asked us for checks or modifiers. And the exact vocabulary is not very important. But the basic idea here is that each of our characters are good at different things. And we get to sort of choose areas that we are really good at and then add a little bit of a bonus to every role we do in that arena. So, Eric, tell us a bit about the abilities.
Eric: Right. So, there are six skills. There is strength, which is like strength. Things that have to do with your body. There is dexterity, which is quickness. Your ability to do flips and jump around. A constitution has to do with your hit points. But, constitution, you would think of like, “Are you able to eat a piece of trash and not vomit?” Like, pigs have very high constitution.
Amanda: And I have very low constitution and cannot eat dairy.
Eric: Right. Exactly. Amanda has very low constitution. Then you have wisdom and intelligence, which is about the things that your – your mind is good at. The difference between the two is that intelligence is book learning and wisdom is street smarts. So, intelligence includes your knowledge of magic and includes your knowledge of history and religion. While wisdom is like, “Hey, do you know how to interact with this animal? Do you think that this person is lying or not?’ Different classes are the different types of jobs or abilities you might have as a character. Depending on if you're an intelligence-based person, you know, a lot of book learning. Like, you’re a wizard. But, if you have a lot of wisdom, you might be like a ranger or someone who interacts with animals or like a sorcerer. Someone who just, like, has innate good magic inside them. And, finally, there's charisma, which is talking to other people and also the magic that comes off of talking to other people.
Amanda: And each of these six skills has a bunch of different specialized abilities within them. So, just because, for example, your intelligence generally is rather low, if you practice magic, you might be really good at magic.
Eric: So, underneath the strength umbrella, you'll have athletics. Underneath the dexterity umbrella, you'll have acrobatics. So, flipping as opposed to just being nimble. You'll hear perception checks a lot, which is under the wisdom umbrella. That's if you're able to see. But then you can see investigation, which is under intelligence. So, your ability to look for things because of what you've seen before in your experience. And then things that happen with charisma, performance, going on stage, intimidation, getting somebody to do what you want from threatening to fight them, but not actually fighting them and then, like, persuade would be under charisma.
Amanda: So, how specifically do these checks and roles work when you ask us to, , ike make an animal handling check?
Eric: Let's say Amanda is playing, like, Guenhwyvar the brave, who is a knight. And she also loves dogs. It’s A fantasy world, where Amanda can hang out with dogs, right?
Amanda: Yes, no allergies in D&D.
Eric: Right. So, Guenhwyvar is out in the forest. She's walking around. And she sees a wolf. Amanda, you can decide what to do with Guenhwyvar as she sees a wolf in the forest.
Amanda: So, maybe I will try to say, “Here, doggy, good boy.”
Eric: Okay. So, if you want to call the wolf a doggy --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- and pat them on the head, that would require a specific ability. You would do an animal handling check. So, Amanda would look on her character sheet. And there is a number that's associated with animal handling. Let's say Guenhwyvar has always loved dogs. You might have, like, a plus five to animal handling, right?
Amanda: So, I add that to whatever the dice tells me when I roll it.
Eric: Right. So, I'm gonna ask you to roll an animal handling check. Roll, roll, roll. You got a 15. So, the 15 from the dice plus the five that Guenhwyvar is already good at is a 20. That is very good. So, the wolf bounces over to you and licks your face. And what do you do when the wolf flicks your face?
Amanda: I say, “Yay, I love dogs. I'm not gonna sneeze whatsoever.”
Eric: And you give it big pats.
Amanda: It’s fantasy.
Eric: Yeah, give it big pats.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: So, that is kind of like the distillation of everything in Dungeons and Dragons. You can see that Amanda playing as Guenhwyvar decided what to do in that situation. I didn't say automatically make an animal handling check to befriend the wolf. You could have fought the wolf. You could have tried to run away. You could have climbed a tree. But, because you decided to befriend the wolf, we rolled the ability associated with the thing that you're going to do.
Amanda: And that also brings up the idea of talking as a player versus playing in character. And, because we are telling a story, we want it to be immersive. We want you to really get lost in it and get to know our characters. Whenever the players talk to one another or we talk to a character that Eric is playing as a DM, maybe a shopkeeper that we have to talk to or one of our friends that we see most weeks and most episodes, we talk to them character to character. But then we always have the ability of asking a question. Just person to person, being like, “Hey, Eric, as the DM, can I try A, B or C? Or, hey, Julia, as my co-player, do you want to try doing this? Or, hey, Brandon, did you have a magic item that I remembered from two weeks ago?”
Eric: Although I know, as the DM, what's going to happen, like, the character might not. So, it's important to interact with all these different characters and talk to each other and, like, play in the space of the story.
Amanda: Yeah, it's very show, don't tell. You don't tell us there's a heist happening at this location. You're gonna go solve it tonight or in this session. But you kind of give us clues. You give us opportunities. You entice us and our characters to go where you want us to go. And we do sometimes. In other times, we don’t.
Eric: And that's okay if you don't do what I want. Because what I want doesn't necessarily matter. Yeah. Like, I can prep things ahead of time about where I think things will happen and what's going to happen in the world. And things might happen, like, not onscreen or things that the characters don't know. Like, that's okay. It's up to the characters to control the story.
Amanda: And, to help you differentiate between when we're talking as people and when we're talking as our characters, we use character voices. So, we differentiate a little bit as well. And Eric has a whole library of voices he uses for the different non-player characters and PCs that we meet along the way.
Eric: Oi, love, this is one of my character voices.
Amanda: It's not one. And it shouldn’t be.
Eric: It’s not one. Oi, I’m the bartender.
Amanda: We have to go to more bars.
Eric: Yeah. All of the – all bartenders sound like that.
Amanda: And, every two episodes, we're going to publish what we call an Afterparty, which is where all four of us just as people making a podcast, sit down and talk about our experiences playing in that session. We debrief. We answer listener questions. We talk about news and different happenings in the world of role-playing games and D&D specifically. So, they're not mandatory to enjoy the story. But, if you like that kind of thing and you like listening to director’s commentaries on D&D, those are there for you to enjoy every two episodes. You want to hear these tutorials in action, in an actual game of D&D, the beginning of Campaign 1, our first storyline, the first two episodes have, like, annotated versions. They start with Beginners Start Here. And, every few minutes, you'll hear my voice pop in and explain what's happening, whether that's a check or roll or a decision being made or something D&D wise being referenced. And it's sort of like an applied lesson – applied theory for you. That as well as the first episode of Campaign 2 in Lake Town City, which we are just starting is available at jointhepartypod.com or in your podcast app where you're listening right now. So, go enjoy Episode 1.
Eric: Hooray.
Amanda: Yay.

[Rewinding noise fades into bubbly music that runs throughout]
Announcer: Oh hi, I didn't see you there. I'm Sage Lanceleaf, Chief Curator of the Murrow Museum of the Future and Future Creations or MMFFC. What does that mean? Well, I look to our past to think about what might happen in Lake Town City in the future.
Well you're sitting right there, lemme tell you how it all happened.
Chapter One - How It All Happened
Back in 1985, Dr. Cassandra Morrow was working on a Very Powerful Clean Energy source at her summer home in Lake Town. She built her own piece of atomic equipment in the basement of a bungalow!
As she finally moves all the atoms together, there is a giant explosion of heat and energy, and from that she makes a new element, diaphorum! That's from the Greek work diaphorá, meaning difference. She was ready to make a difference!
Chapter Two - What Had Happened Next
What Had Happened Next was the town started to grow! Everyone wanted their hands on diaphorum, but the good doctor knew she had to hold them in check. She made everyone promise — from CEOS to criminals to the president himself — that they couldn't get this new amazing element with out promising to bring jobs, roads, houses and more to her little Lake Town. So, they did! And America is now 50% dependent on the clean energy of diaphorum.
And then our town wasn't so little. It became a city, a Lake Town City, a mix of everyone who wants to come and make a difference. We open our arms to everyone, especially the New Yorkers who made the tough decision to move to Lake Town City after the tragedies of 9/11.
[long pause]
Chapter Three - What Happened Wasn't All Good
You can say that right. Think about Jim Taylorson, the tech guy at a big factory who's company will remain nameless. But you know! Jim tried to change Industrial Area with his new fangled people movers, trying to get people to move faster! How silly, we walk just fine. Dr. Morrow said ""those people movers were really dangerous"" and Jim said, they're fine, and then they all exploded. That's where we all get the term Jimmed It Up from — that Jim himself. But we can all learn from Jim's mistakes — ask for help!
Chapter Four - What Is Happening Now
We're all happening now! Dr. Morrow is still a big part of the city, acting as mayor for thirty years. She helped bring in our world-class public transportation — the SKYTRAM system that takes throughout the city via gondela and our new high-speed rail that connects LTC with NYC.
While you're here, make sure to take in the sites! Take in a theater production in SOLIta arts district or a hockey game at Thornhill Arena — go Mountain Lobsters! Or grab a slice of our world famous Crayfish Pie down at Dominic’s!
And don't forget to check out the amazing Historic Lake Town district, where it truly all began.
Lake Town City: Building Yesterday's Promise Today and Tomorrow! YEAH!"

Eric: So, we have our first map. And, ordinarily, if this was A Quiet Year, we would skip this, and we will build off of it as events happen. But, since we are going from a town to a city, we are going to take a new piece of paper.
Amanda: Ooh!
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: (Gasp) Twist.
Eric: Now Amanda, I want you to hold on to this. This is gonna be our reference point—
Amanda: Okay!
Eric: – about where we start. I also want to keep all of the abundances and scarcities aware and all of the things that we've named as we were in there. So, now that we have our town, we’re gonna move to the second map. Oh, fuck!
Brandon: Map game!
Eric: Map game! It’s a map with a game. This is—
Julia: Isn’t it a game with the map?
Amanda: Map game. It’s a game with a map.
Brandon: No, it's a map with a game.
Eric: It’s map with the game.
Julia: Fucking, Eric.
Eric: So, now, I want to imagine that the second map is like we moved out two clicks on Google Maps. So, we're zooming out here.
Brandon: You can no longer see that guy frozen in his driveway next to this man.
Amanda: No. No.
Eric: Exactly. You can – and there is, like, now a little point that's like – that's like local crayfish. Lake Town. But we are moving back. So, the town is now gonna be a circle in the top-right corner of the map. I've created a rough topography of the land zoomed out here. We have a river stretching down the right-hand side of the page. There is a dense forest on the bottom of the page.
Brandon: Sticks with hats.
Eric: Sticks with hats. And there's a local road that stretches from the town at the top right all the way down the page to the bottom left. There are also a few small hamlets along the highway. This thing – there's like a few shops, maybe a church, maybe some homes, but like no more than like 1,000 people in any of these little hamlets, which I've dotted with Xs on the land. But, otherwise, the land is really undeveloped. So, we're gonna start turning this map, turning the town that we had in the other map into a city. I have a bunch of prompts that I've written down on slips of paper. And we're gonna go around the table clockwise. On your turn, you're going to take one of the slips of paper, read the prompt out loud, and then resolve it by talking it out with all of us and then making some sort of drawing on this new blanker map. The prompt might ask you a question, it might bring bad news, or it might create an opportunity. If it's your turn, it's up to you to make the decisions. You can ask all of us questions. But, ultimately, it's your call. Whenever it makes sense in a situation, again, add new drawings and symbols to the map to reflect what changed in the city. If these changes affect something else that's already drawn, someone else can speak up and talk about how it might change something that was already there. Maybe, preferably, someone who would draw on the thing, but anyone has a chance here. We also have our abundances as resources to guide your decisions. So, what is the city value? How do they respond to success and adversity? And who needs places and who will give them that space? I have four piles of six prompts. Each pile is gonna represent an era of life and growth in the city. As we start each new pile, we're going to transition into an arrow with an era events. I want you to treat this like an all play in Pictionary. I'm going to lay out the situation or problem. And all of you are gonna collaborate to figure out how the city would handle it. The players must come to an agreement. And then we're going to draw the results. Hopefully, I'm gonna be kind of hands-off during the era events, but I am going to take a turn as we go around and do the smaller events there. The names of the era are the Start, the Boom, the Build and the New Age.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Ooh, what causes this in the plot? We shall not to know.
Eric: Thank you.
Brandon: That’s when – that’s when they left the silver standard.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: That is a joke I make. And I'm upset that you made it. I've done that. I've made that joke at least five times in Join the Party. I’m very annoyed. Alright. So, does everybody understand what's going on?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Alright, cool.
Brandon: I’m gonna name my character William Jennings Bryan now.
Eric: Damn it.
Amanda: Oh, no.
Eric: That would be super fucking funny. Alright. Here is one of your pile. Just kind of like pick a random one from there. But I'm going to start with the first era event for the start. This is 1988.
Amanda: Oh, city on a move.
Eric: Good news. You're allowed to spread outside of the confines of Laketown, and really be ready to make it into Lake Town City. Doo-dah, doo-dahp
Brandon: It’s Laketon? It’s Laketon City?
Julia: No, it’s not.
Amanda: No, it’s Laketown.
Brandon: Oh, no. Oh, no.
Amanda: Impostor, shakoz!
Eric: So, I want everyone to pick a new neighborhood to establish the vague space of it, who lives there, and what is its vibe. And you can use the hamlets here as a kind of the center of your neighborhoods if you want to start. But you can kind of do whatever you want.
Amanda: So, like a city glamming, all of the small towns around it.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Like, becomes neighborhoods in the bigger city.
Eric: Yeah, it's like someone put an initiative and is like, “Hey, make this into a city.” And there wasn't really any city planning. So, people kind of just rushed out and made the thing – made the thing as soon as they could. So, why don't you guys pick a place and tell me about what it's like?
Julia: So, I'm going to put like below Laketown on the riverside here, Little Italy.
Amanda: Oh, no. Oh, no.
Brandon: The best eggplant parmesan, crayfish mash-up this side of the Mississippi.
Amanda: Very good. Julia's drawing a big old pizza slice.
Eric: Nice. And then, Julia, can you just like make – put the bounds of it?
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Now, Julia, why did you choose next to the river?
Julia: So, because a lot of, you know, shipping and stuff like that happens via rivers and stuff like that. And, so, I'm thinking it connects to New York City. And the reason I chose Little Italy is because, whenever there's a city in growth, there is a mafia connection.
Amanda: Ooh.
Julia: So, there's probably like docks and stuff on the river here. So, can I build that out a little bit?
Eric: Yeah, go ahead.
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: Is that where they like do the cement shoes and then, also, like, get their bottles of marinara shipped down to them?
Amanda: And enjoy a big plate of spaghetti.
Julia: Yes. You, you all are correct.
Brandon: I am just imagining like those little pizza parlor shakers of parmesan floating down the river.
Amanda: But I think that pepper flakes would float really well as well.
Brandon: That's true
Eric: I like those. Yeah. Tell me about the vibe. And, obviously, it's Little Italy. So, we kind of know who lives there.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: But tell me more.
Julia: It probably kind of has – like, the city underbelly is by the docks, but the closer you get to the highway is a little bit more like touristy with a lot of like mom and pop restaurants and, like, a good deli situation going on and importer/exporter area, that sort of thing.
Eric: Cool. I like it.
Brandon: I like it. Is there any well-known dish like pizza or—
Julia: I'm so glad you asked.
Amanda: Is it – Julia, may I make a guess? Is it mountain lobster pizza?
Julia: Yeah, of course, it is.
Amanda: Yay.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Love it.
Julia: I've been dying – like, I've been waiting. I was like, “How I will put a Little Italy and their specialty is going to be mountain lobster pizza?”
Amanda: This is the part of the movie—
Brandon: Cream sauce?
Amanda: –where we reshow a re-edit of the beginning of the movie, where, actually, Julia was in on it the whole time.
Julia: It's not cream sauce. It's actually like a – like a spicy red sauce.
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Brandon: Ooh.
Amanda: Like Arrabiata or like a—
Julia: Oh, yeah.
Amanda: – a cocktail sauce type sauce.
Julia: No, like a Diablo.
Brandon: Ooh.
Amanda: Tomato based.
Julia: A little bit of like crushed red pepper in there.
Amanda: Hell yeah.
Eric: That makes sense. That’s so much better.
Brandon: Then some optional hot honey.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Brandon, can I go next?
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: So, I'm going to base my neighborhood. There is an X on the left-hand side of the page. Like, behind another X. So, it's not even on the highway. It must be kind of like – or the local road. It must be like additional local roads to get to this neighborhood. This is gonna be the, like, crunchy granola, there used to be a cult, and, now, there's a bunch of like people who blog about their organic farming or this is pre-blog. This is a bunch of people who get like the Mother Earth magazine I think it was, where like original hippies who like bought nutritional yeast and things got them.
Julia: They’re probably making like zines and stuff that they hand out at the farmer’s market.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. I mean very much like, you know, east side of Austin, East Nashville, you know, kind of feeling where, yeah, it's people who – the land is pretty cheap. They can kind of do whatever they want. And they're just, like, weird in the best way, hippie granola type people.
Eric: Can you just put a little symbol to demonstrate that?
Amanda: Yes, I will put a bottle of Kombucha.
Brandon: Perfect.
Julia: Wonderful.
Brandon: Can you draw the scoby too?
Julia: Gotta draw that scobe.
Amanda: I drew a little spider looking scoby at the bottom of the bottle.
Brandon: Oh, gross works.
Eric: That works.
Brandon: I hate it.
Eric: You asked for it.
Brandon: I know. I regret everything.
Eric: Alright, Brandon, give it a shot.
Brandon: Okay. I have been fascinated with – whenever you're developing new space, there's like – they have to build these like shanty towns where the workers live while they are working on the project. That happened when they made the Hoover Dam too. And then, when the thing happens, it sort of either get subsumed or just like abandoned.
Eric: Sure.
Brandon: And I think that's so fascinating that they have to build a town before they have to build the thing they’re actually trying to do.
Julia: Sure. Yeah.
Eric: No, that's great.
Brandon: So, I think it'd be actually closer to the town because they started building closer to town. They started building outwards.
Eric: For sure.
Brandon: So – and I do think it has grown a little bit in size, because the projects that these people were on ended, but the people ended up just liking the town because the federal government covered some of their housing expenses.
Eric: Yes.
Brandon: And they – it was a nice place to live. So, they just end up staying. And, now, it actually becomes like a, a weird mix of, like, shanty houses but also like newly constructed nice family homes. So, there’s definitely some abandoned buildings in there. And there’s definitely some, like, 1950s Norman Rockwell style homes as well.
Eric: Yeah, that’s just like that's where the first neighborhood is, I guess.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Cool.
Amanda: I’m picturing like, like Manchester, Belfast, or some of these like industrial company towns mashed up with like farmhouses.
Brandon: Yeah. Yeah.
Amanda: It’s pretty cool.
Brandon: Yeah. So, I'm gonna draw – to represent Norman Rockwell, I'm gonna draw a turkey.
Julia: Okay. It makes sense.
Brandon: It's, it's symbolic, y’all.
Julia: Do you want to put your hand down on it? That’s it. Okay. And draw it appropriately.
Brandon: And then, to represent the, the shantytown, I'm just gonna draw, like, in a house. And then – Oh, dang, the hat fell off.
Amanda: Oh, no.
Eric: Oh, no.
Julia: Oh, no.
Eric: I like that. And I was inspired to make, like, an industrial district. I feel like a business district necessarily, but I think that it does need to be close to where Brandon did. And it should also be close to the only highway at the moment. So, I think it's gonna like just be this little slice right here.
Amanda: Like, the very middle of the page.
Eric: Right in the middle of the page. And I'm gonna make a little factory.
Amanda: So, smokestacks. Aah.
Eric: It's also like pretty close to the – to the original Laketown.
Amanda: And to the, the Hippie district.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Makes sense.
Eric: And, also, it's also pretty close to the docks as well. And, so, now all of this stuff that we haven't developed still is like open. So, maybe we'll add – end up adding more neighborhoods later. Alright. So, starting to my left, Amanda, why don't you choose one of our slips?
Amanda: Sure. I will choose the smallest one. So, what is the most beautiful thing in this area or what is the most hideous thing in this area?
Julia: Hmm.
Amanda: Hmm.
Brandon: They are both the giant crawfish.
Amanda: Aah.
Eric: That is good. And it's still there.
Julia: Crawfish. Crawfish.
Amanda: You are not wrong, Brandon. He’s too small for me to see him right now, but he's there waving all the time. I think that at the bottom left of the map, so kind of like the outside edge of this two-lane road leading up to Laketown, that someone built a sort of like rest stop. But it was in – whatever – it says the mid-80s. So, it's just like concrete brutalist.
Julia: Ooh.
Amanda: And it is mad ugly. And, on the top of it, it has a crayfish neon sign.
Julia: Ooh.
Brandon: Hmm.
Amanda: So, it's the Welcome to Laketown Rest Stop.
Julia: Love it.
Eric: Welcome to Lake Town City.
Julia: Lake Town City.
Brandon: And, as the tourists come in, they stopped to this rest stop, and they're like, “Oh, the famous mountain lobsters. This is where we get them.” And then the real townies are like, “No. No. No.”
Julia: No. No. No.
Brandon: That's the fake crap.
Julia: You gotta get in the city to get to the real one.
Brandon: You gotta go to the Crawfish House.
Eric: Right. But it’s all --
Julia: You go to Crawfish House or you get the slice.
Amanda: I drew, at the bottom-left corner of the map, a little like access road, a big parking lot, a gross cube with a lobster on top.
Julia: Incredible.
Eric: Nice. Julia, grab.
Julia: Alright. So, what group has the highest status in the community? What must people do to gain inclusion in this group? Interesting. And doesn't have to be established like within the communities that we have already made?
Eric: Nope. You can start from what we have both in the town and in the city or you can just add somebody new.
Julia: I think it's like – I think townies. Like, people who were in the original town who have been there forever. Even as the, the city grows out, the original townies have this kind of like status to them that I think that it's important to highlight. Yeah.
Eric: Interesting. So, do we want to clarify? Do we want townies, or the summering people, or the original people who are in Laketown when it was Laketown when the inciting event happened?
Julia: I want to say townies specifically, but, as a larger group, inciting incident people. So, people who are in town, who were there for the quarantine as a larger group are very, like, well respected, but it's the townies who like owned all the businesses in Laketown to begin with.
Amanda: It’s like layers on layers.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Like, I was there. Well, did you live there? No, I was just vacationing.
Julia: Like, I've – I've owned the Mountain Lobster Shack in my entire life.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah. Anyway.
Eric: So, Julia, why don't you put something down there? And I don't remember if I clarified this, but, during our history that I, I talked with our players about, there is an inciting incident which kind of like kicks off the history that we're creating here, why the city becomes the thing where it is, and why the mad scientist and the science is in abundance. Later, I think the government tries to bring them back, everyone who was affected by the inciting incident, to be under quarantine and understudy, because things are happening to them. And we'll get into that later.
Julia: I just kind of read through the lake in this sort of sliver that is between the – what did you call before? The shantytown?
Brandon: Norman Shanty Town.
Julia: Norman Shantytown, the Industrial District, and Little Italy. There's just this little sliver leading directly into the original town. And I think that's kind of the occupying area that people – after the quarantine, maybe they left, but they didn’t go too far. Like, the super expensive parts of Queens.
Eric: Exactly.
Julia: Where it's like still suburbs.
Eric: Right.
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: It is the closest suburb, and that makes it very expensive.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And – but it is nice.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I love that. Brandon, it is now your turn.
Brandon: Okay. The mad scientist decides to move elsewhere in the city.
Amanda: Wooh.
Brandon: Where did she go? What does her new house look like? I think the mad scientist – yeah. As soon as people start invading her space a little bit, I think she's gonna try to like – well, first of all, she has more status. Like, people know her now. So, she's – she's not really able to hide anymore. And, so, she also wants to like sort of stake claim. Like, make sure that she doesn't lose her town and her predominance.
Eric: 100 percent.
Brandon: I think she would be like within – like, on the very edge here of the new outcrop of, of townies.
Amanda: Cool.
Brandon: But, like, still on the perimeter. It's, like – yeah, you know, when you're, like, a senator who lives just on the border, like, in the very wealthy town.
Amanda: A good district.
Eric: I also love how she's still a presence in like the townies or the first people’s area. I like that a lot.
Julia: Brandon, drew a very good beaker with like bumbling stuff coming out of it.
Amanda: Yay.
Eric: Nice. Hell yeah. Alright. I'm gonna go. Oh, wonderful. The city elects its first mayor. Who is it? What is their platform? Represent them with the city government building.
Brandon: Eric, if it's not the giant mountain lobster, I'm quitting.
Julia: Everyone wrote in the giant mountain lobster. They had to call the election null and void.
Brandon: It was the second-place winner who actually got it.
Eric: I'm so glad this came about to me because I had this idea. I totally think it's the mad scientist.
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: 100 percent.
Julia: Yeah, do it.
Eric: And, like, you wouldn't think so, but I think that a lot of people believed in what she was doing. There's – she’s kind of like the spurring idea of why everything was happening. And there might be other reasons that we'll get into. I'm very inspired by the idea that Albany is the capital of New York instead of New York City, because I want something that's in the middle. So, there's this X, which is literally just on the highway in the middle. So, I'm just going to make a little circle. And I'm gonna make this like downtown.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Cool. I love that.
Eric: Which is where the government.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And the X is literally – this was like an old state-building. And the, the mad scientist was like, “Yeah, fuck it. I'll just – I'll work there.”
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: This is where the seat of government is.
Julia: Sure.
Eric: Congratulations. So, I’m gonna make this—
Julia: We did it gang.
Amanda: And it’s a nice commute for her because her house is right on the highway too.
Brandon: It's like one of those downtown's where there's like one actual good restaurant, and then everything else is like, “Meh.”
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Exactly. That’s how I feel about the Portland Downtown.
Brandon: Yeah, exactly.
Eric: It’s, like, there's so much about Portland that I love. But, like, the actual downtown makes absolutely no sense to me.
Amanda: Yeah, the real – those who are really in the know go up the road to Little Italy for lunch.
Julia: Of course.
Brandon: Or over to the Hippie Town.
Amanda: Crunchy granola town.
Eric: Dang. Dang good.
Julia: Depends on what you’re looking for.
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Brandon: Some vegan stuff.
Eric: So, I'm gonna put the—
Amanda: The interns go west too.
Eric: So, this is the downtown district with the city government and the mayor. Their platform was just like on the growth and the creation. It’s like, “Let's make this the best city in America – the best new city in America. Like, the city of the future.” And I think that it now that she's a public figure, she continues to push that. And, like, she does scientific things. I think that she's also like, very involved in everything.
Brandon: A mountain lobster in every pot.
Julia: Incredible. So, only one though and they're about yay big.
Amanda: Ooh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Eric: And, like, it's like a—
Brandon: It wasn’t very big. Promise.
Eric: It's like a mountain lobster in every pot and a robot in every home or something like that. 100 percent.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Oh, shit for so good.
Julia: We're all living in the Jetsons’ era.
Eric: Yeah. Like, that's what she's trying to do.
Amanda: Alright. I got, “There is one good road and one not so good at being a road that connects the neighborhoods.”
Julia: Nah.
Amanda: What are they?
Eric: Okay. So, you're gonna put down two roads. So, you're gonna connect one neighborhood to another neighborhood in a good way. And you're gonna connect one neighborhood to another neighborhood in a bad way.
Amanda: So, I think it makes sense for there to be a good back road that gets built between the industrial zone, the shantytown, and the government. Like, this one highway is gonna get a lot of traffic. So, I think that the mayor or someone else builds a road that sort of connects the rest stop actually to all the way up in the shantytown. So, it's like a back road that you can, can access.
Eric: Great.
Amanda: I'm gonna make it pretty straight just to be efficient.
Eric: Those of you playing at home, our dotted lines are where the neighborhoods are, but the straight lines are roads.
Julia: Got it.
Amanda: And then I think the inefficient road is going to wind along the river, but not, not close to the river. Like, it – it's kind of like winding. Maybe it goes around like trees or fishing holes or whatever, like, old farms that used to be there. So, if you want to get from the original Laketown down to the forest, good luck.
Julia: Oh my god. This is the worst road I've ever seen.
Brandon: Who built this road?
Eric: 100 percent that—
Amanda: Me.
Eric: That’s – that’s literally the highway for Bear Mountain.
Amanda: Yeah, exactly.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I like that.
Julia: Wild.
ES: That’s – that is beautiful.
Amanda: And you'll note, it does not actually connect to Laketown proper. It only connects to the docks. You just drive through the docks if you want to get actually to Laketown.
Eric: I love this idea because we still haven't developed that area there. So, it's like, “Oh shit, something's gonna develop. And it's just, like, it's so hard to get there.”
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: Or, like, the people are independent. Alright. We have one last one for the Start era. And, Julia, let's do it.
Brandon: Julia.
Julia: What belief or practice helps to unify your community? Ooh.
Brandon: Oh, could this be fun.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: I'm open to ideas if y'all want to throw things at me because nothing immediately springs to mind. Other than like, the concept of innovation, I suppose.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Like, everything is meant to make it better. And, in a lot of ways, I think that kind of has people step away from tradition.
Amanda: I love that idea that there might be a better way.
Brandon: What about to broaden it out a little bit? What if it's just like futurism? Like, it's not strictly innovation, but it's, like, we are the next step in township, in science, in pizza development.
Amanda: I think it's great because there are good and bad that comes out of that.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I like that too because that also keeps the opportunity in weird places. It’s that, like, it's not about necessarily changing, because there does seem to be some sort of, like, holding on to the idea that we were a town and, now, we're in a city or like we're a city of the future.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Like—
Brandon: Like, there's definitely like a museum somewhere that is dressed up in futurism, but futurism from 1982, you know.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: It never changes.
Amanda: Oh, Julia drawing some great Neo-Grecian architecture.
Brandon: Yeah. It looks like a Pantheon.
Julia: So, I think in our government center area, our downtown area, we have that, like, Museum of Tomorrow.
Brandon: Oh, I like that.
Amanda: Hell yeah.
Eric: Oh, yeah. Fuck, yes.
Brandon: There's an exhibit that does, like, rotate.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Alright. Ba, da, bop, bop, bop, bop, paw, papaw. We are in era two.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: The Boom. People are coming fast and furious to the city.
Julia: Vin Diesel's here?
Eric: Yes. Let's institute public transportation. What does the city invest in? Or, a major local employer builds a regional amenity, a hospital, an art center, et cetera, what is it?
Amanda: We—
Eric: So, is this – as people show up, are we going to invest in public transportation or we can go into invest in a different thing, but we asked a private person to build it?
Julia: Public transportation, please.
Eric: I know that's the good option, but what do you think actually happens? Based on what we've laid out.
Julia: I want public transportation so bad though, Eric.
Amanda: What if?
Julia: What if?
Eric: Marvel presents what if.
Amanda: What if the mayor, in the futurism theme that we're building on here, decides to invest super hard in trams?
Julia: Yes.
Eric: I was literally—
Amanda: And, like, – or – either trams or, like, a ski lift funicular gondola.
Brandon: Sky trams?
Amanda: Sky tram.
Julia: Sky tram.
Amanda: So, it's a tram but in sky.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: And, so, that would—
Brandon: With hat.
Amanda: Yeah. Little hats so snow does not fall. So, it would actually solve some problems. Like, if we're in Upstate New York, there's gonna be a lot of snow. If there are a lot of people coming, they are not gonna want to rely on cars. So, I can almost picture a – like gondola – I'm just going to call it a sky tram network. Like, zigzagging all across town. Maybe there's a couple different lines. Maybe it's a grid almost. Like, it’s imposed on it. I don't know how we want to draw it. Maybe there's like a central station.
Eric: So, like, Amanda, why don't you put the station. And let's assume that it spiders out. And there's limited connection on the outer rims between neighborhoods.
Julia: I feel like—
Brandon: I think it would also be less developed in the actual Laketown.
Eric: Agree.
Amanda: I’m picturing, yeah, like the city center. Yeah. So, why don't I do it on the edge of the industrial zone and the downtown? Because the Capitol Building wouldn't want it like next to the Capital Building. But it will be accessible to the people who are going to work in the industrial zone.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: And then from there sort of like hub-and-spoke style to the middle of the page. All of the different branches branch out to different area.
Brandon: I like said that the mayor, when they were like proposing this project, was like, “Let's show the world how beautiful our city is with the sky trams.”
Julia: Love sky tram.
Eric: Sky tram. Sky trams.
Amanda: So, I drew – I drew a little gondola sky tram kind of off the highway on the border between industrial zone and the downtown.
Eric: Nice.
Julia: I love it.
Eric: Hell fucking yeah. So, Brandon is gonna go first in round two.
Brandon: Is it spelled, like, with two Ys or an I? Sky?
Amanda: I think it’s—
Julia: It’s as in a ski.
Amanda: – all caps.
Brandon: Oh, okay.
Amanda: It’s styled in all caps every time.
Brandon: I like it.
Amanda: SKY tram.
Brandon: SKY tram.
Eric: So, it's about seven years afterwards. So, we started in ‘88 + 7. We are now in ‘90 – from ‘95 to about 2003. So, SKY tram is such a ‘90s ass shit.
Amanda: In Al Gore's alternate America, we lean hard into transportation.
Julia: Public transport.
Eric: Yeah, Al Gore is there during the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Julia: He's crying. He's so proud tears.
Eric: He’s fucking tears. He's like, “Bill wanted to come here, but I said, no, this is my thing.”
Julia: Yep.
Brandon: Whoa. This is fun. Okay, I drew mine. A headstrong community member decides to put one of their ideas in motion.
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: Starts a foolish project. Open to ideas.
Julia: What, what's a dumb hippie thing that might have been put into fruition?
Brandon: What's the dumb thing that a city – yeah, the city would, would do that would like fall out of misuse within like a year?
Amanda: It could be like a – within the neighborhood type transport. Maybe it's like car sharing, but their golf carts. And they forgot that it gets winter.
Brandon: Like, I was thinking scooters. Exactly.
Amanda: Yep. Yep.
Julia: It works for a summer.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: I don't – the scooters are too much of a hellscape for me, but I like golf carts.
Amanda: Maybe it's a—
Brandon: Was like super future?
Amanda: On the street trams?
Brandon: I – okay. Here's an idea. I think they would do the sidewalks of tomorrow, and they're like people mover.
Amanda: Yes, Brandon.
Brandon: Yeah. What do they call – what are those called?
Julia: People movers.
Eric: They’re people movers. You’re right. Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: And they put like six of them, and no one uses them, because why would you.
Amanda: They’re always broken. Yeah.
Eric: They’re always broken.
Amanda: There's no one in them much of the time.
Julia: It’s very good.
Eric: I'm gonna say we have to put it in a neighborhood. So, what neighborhood tried to do it and who is it?
Brandon: Tu, tu, tu, tu. I think that's like a downtown thing probably, right?
Julia: Yeah. It's seems like Government Center would put that in being like it's accessible.
Brandon: I think either industrial or capitol.
Julia: Oh, leading industrial to capitol, I think, would make sense.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Do you think they’re trying to encourage people to walk to work?
Brandon: Yeah, that’s good.
Eric: So, even in the winter?
Amanda: Yeah. Maybe between the tram station and the capitol building.
Eric: Now, this is created by a person. So, who thought this was a good idea? You can also create a person.
Julia: I like the idea of whoever the person who invented this is that we like to use it as slang in the city. You’d be like, “Alight. Great like, like Einstein but not sarcastic.”
ES: In—
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Julia: Where’s it’s like, “Great idea…”
Eric: This is good. I like – so, in the industrial area, there are, like, companies that decided to come in. And, for whatever reason, they, they see a burgeoning city. So, like, is there like a CFO or a CTO in, like, one of these dumb big companies that thought this was a great idea?
Julia: It’s [Antoine]
Brandon: Yeah, I think there's like a sort of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates kind of person in their garage making things that, that kind of people, but, like, fucking terrible.
Eric: Right.
Brandon: So, like Biztown but a tech.
Eric: I like that.
Amanda: I think last name should definitely be a noun. Like Gates and Jobs.
Brandon: Mhmm. Okay.
Julia: Stones?
Brandon: I'm bad at naming things. So, yeah, let's – so, there's like legitimate companies.
Amanda: John Profit.
Eric: Man, he really Jim that up. His name is just Jim.
Amanda: Right.
Eric: We just remember him as Jim.
Amanda: Jim Jimson?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And he worked at one of the companies, and we'll establish that later. And, now, it's slang. That, if you – when you mess up—
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: – you gotta be, “You really Jimmed it.”
Julia: Yeah, man.
Amanda: This is a real Jim Jam, huh?
Eric: Yeah, it’s the real Jim Jam.
Julia: A Jim Jam.
Eric: It's a real Jim Jam.
Julia: Yes, I love that.
Eric: That's perfect. Brandon, write the word Jim Jam next to them.
Julia: Please.
Amanda: Jim Jam.
Eric: This is the only time. Because we established it together, we're gonna include that in that’s now city slang.
Julia: Jim Jam.
Eric: I fucking love that.
Julia: Real fucking—
Amanda: I'm trying to redeem myself from Timbly Tumblies.
Julia: Fucking Jim Jam that.
Brandon: So, I think what Jim did was like a lot of legitimate companies came in and was like, “Hey, we'll take on your government contract to like build roads and your SKY trams or whatever.” And then Jim was like, you know, from fucking Silicon Valley, California. And he was like, “I'm gonna come in and fucking innovate. I'm gonna disrupt. Let's go. People movers.” And that—
Amanda: It is the first dotcom boom, pets.com.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Going everywhere.
Brandon: Yep.
Amanda: It’s the cut.
Brandon: And then, yeah, everyone was like, “I guess.” And then—
Eric: Yeah, but that's the thing with the mayor. It’s that she – anything that looks like innovation, she'll do it.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: And then no one used them.
Eric: They really Jimmed it up.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: It was a real Jim Jam.
Brandon: It’s a real JJ.
Julia: It’s real Jim Jam.
Eric: Alright. Five. Fuck yes. I'm so glad I got this one. Name a bar of recognition.
Julia: (Gasp).
Eric: Why is it so? who hangs out there?
Julia: I wanted that one.
Eric: Sorry, bruv.
Julia: Darn.
Eric: I'm gonna say it's an extension of Astro Lane. I think that Astro lane—
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: – because they were—
Brandon: Astro Lane After Dark.
Eric: Astro Lane. So, now, there is a bowling alley/bar that is like all over the city. There's one in every single neighborhood. But I think like the really hip one is definitely in West – in West Town?
Julia: I think it's gotta be called Astros. It's not Astro Lane anymore, but it’s Astros.
Eric: Yeah, it's just Astros.
Brandon: Yeah, because Astro Lane is a family establishment.
Julia: Of course.
Eric: And they have – they have like slightly different names.
Julia: Astros. Comets,
Brandon: You can get a bowling ball on every single one though.
Julia: That’s the signature drink. If you don't drink a bowling ball at Astros, did you even go?
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I know. And, now, like, the bowling ball is like just local lore. So, I'm gonna say Astros is now in the hippie area.
Julia: So, fucking so not hippie.
Amanda: I love it.
Eric: Bang, bang. Alright. There you go.
Amanda: A contingent within the community demand to be heard, who are they? What are they asking for?
Brandon: Mhmm.
Amanda: Huh. Julia, do you have an idea?
Julia: Um, I'm leaning towards the hippies in this situation.
Brandon: I like that. It could be the hippies asking for like environmental protections. It could be the workers in the shanty town or industrial zone.
Julia: This could go with our mountain lobster theme, too.
Amanda: I was just thinking that. Yeah.
Julia: Where they can see that like, as the restaurants selling mountain lobster get more and more popular—
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Julia: – more and more and famous, they're like, “Listen, the species is gonna die out real quick.”
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: We need to, like, create some sort of conservation effort for them.
Amanda: Totally.
Eric: Yeah, this is also related. I think this creates a lot of tension with the underground crime. It’s that, like, they were – the docks were fine. We were just using it. Nobody touched it. But, now that there are environmental people, either it's government or there's now a company that does this. Like, very similar to what happens in in New York City with the – with the clams and the mussels.
Julia: Where are they gonna dump the bodies?
Eric: Exactly.
Amanda: Yeah, totally agree. So, I think, in West Town, there are a bunch of people who get really into local food. And they realize that this species is in danger of endangerment if the population keeps growing—
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: – like it does. So, can I determine the outcome or is that more up to you?
Eric: No, determine – render the outcome. That's totally fine as long as you can render it in a thing on the map.
Amanda: Yeah. So, I think the mayor is like, “Yes, protect the mountain lobster. Nothing is more important.” And, so, they put up a bunch of – in the same way that like you can grow oysters on like nets underwater, they make some kind of like artificial habitat in the river along the whole length of it. That makes it easier for the crayfish to like breathe and stuff. So, I'm going to make a bunch of little buoys in the river. That indicates where the underground portions of that are.
Eric: Love it.
Amanda: Well, yeah, maybe like the shipping is regulated. Or there's like only a certain amount let in and out every day. And they have to be more careful with their emissions, something like that.
Julia: I love it.
Eric: Love it.
Brandon: Is it—
Julia: Those mobsters gonna be real mad.
Eric: They're gonna be so pissed.
Brandon: Does it sort of mess up the water ecosystem? Like, the balance of it?
Amanda: I think they would do it properly.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: But it probably brings back more plant life to the river, which probably makes it harder to get ships up and down.
Eric: Yes, I think that's the big fallout.
Brandon: OK.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: It’s that shipping is harder. And Mafiosos are fucking pissed.
Julia: So mad about that.
Eric: Alright. Good thing nothing bad ever happens when that happens.
Julia: Uh, huh. Sure. Never.
Brandon: Do you guys want to go to Astros and get a bowling ball after this?
Julia: I would so much.
Amanda: It is one o’clock.
Julia: I actually really want a mountain lobster pizza slice. Alright. Huh. A celebrity moves to town, who is it? Why are they there? Who is excited about it?
Brandon: Matt Damon
Eric: Now, Julia. I will say here's the only constraints and the freedoms I’m going to give you. We are living in – this is anywhere from ‘95 to 2003. So, try to stick with that kind of celebrity. You can also have a real person or a fake person who is an avatar of things that would be popular during that time. So, make whatever choice you would like.
Julia: Who did we say before who's at the ribbon cutting ceremony?
Amanda: Al Gore.
Eric: Al Gore.
Julia: I think it’s Al Gore.
Brandon: Oh, god.
Eric: Wait. So, Al Gore moves his family there—
Julia: Yes. Yes.
Eric: – to Lake Town City?
Julia: 100 percent.
Eric: Amazing.
Amanda: He gets a vacation home in the hills.
Julia: So, I'm gonna put Al Gore's new house on the border of the Norman Rockwell area and the townies like sliver of land.
Eric: I love it. Alright. Brandon, you're back around.
Brandon: Oh, this is interesting. The two high schools in the area have a deep-seated rivalry over what? So, we have to add a second high school or—
Eric: So, you can do one of two things. There is still North Country in the Lake Town area, which services I guess that area. But you see you can add one or two.
Brandon: I see either like a – like a downtown high school or like a charter school type thing in the hippie area.
Amanda: I think there would be a charter school downtown like Miles Morales style.
Brandon: I like that. I like – because I – yeah, we had a – when I was growing up, we had an arts magnet, basically, that was like for singers.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: So, I think – yeah, there would be a STEM school downtown that you have to pass whatever test. And they're, like, heavily focused on STEM.
Eric: So Brandon, what, what do you want the name of this high school be?
Brandon: I think it would just be Lake Town City Magnet. Like, it would be very like industrial.
Eric: I like Lake Town City Magnet. And they call it The Magnet. Cool.
Brandon: And I think the rivalry stems from a couple places. Stems.
Julia: Ooh.
Brandon: One is definitely like socio economic and like academic rivalry, but that's more like deep-seated. Like, that's real. And then I think like there's a fun rivalry, where it's like a prank rivalry type thing where, you know, how colleges will like steal other people's mascots.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: But like, in this one, maybe the STEM, like, people – they pulled some prank with an electromagnet that like turned off all the lights in high school one day or something.
Eric: I like that.
Brandon: And, like, the other high school doesn't know how to do that necessarily. So, they like – I don't know – hoist it.
Brandon: Yeah. Like, roll their high school or something.
Eric: I like that. The one does something very sophisticated. And the other one just does like a straight fucking prank. Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Well, I mean your public high school is not gonna have access to like a giant electromagnet.
Eric: Yeah, exactly.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I love that. I love that so much. That's perfect. Finally, this is the last one of era two, the Boom. The city council wants to attract tourists and families from New York City. Who do they focus on? What is that slogan? Oh, my god. Okay. I can envision that there's just, like, pamphlets just show up in every single person's mailbox. Just how beautiful and the SKY tram is really – is really emphasized. And there's a smiling picture of the mad scientist.
Julia: I forgot about the SKY tram for a hot second.
Amanda: Sky Tram. Sky Tram.
Julia: Oh, damn.
Eric: And it’s like – it is like Lake Town City. The city – I think it might be like the City of the Future.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: They’re is very much leaning City of the Future.
Julia: City of Tomorrow.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: City of Tomorrow.
Amanda: Or like Yesterday's Promise Today or something.
Eric: Yes, that’s it.
Brandon: Yeah, that’s it. Yeah.
Julia: Fuck yeah.
Eric: So, Amanda, write – write Yesterday's Promise Today. This is my demonstration.
Amanda: Okay. I am genuinely extremely hungry now for some kind of shellfish. So, will you guys let me run to the, the kitchenette and grab something real quick?
Julia: Heck yeah.
Eric: I'll be here. I’ll definitely – I'm just gonna stay here.
Brandon: Can you make me a lobster roll?

One of my favorite parts of these pregame episodes and, also, D&D in general is problem-solving. How can I build infrastructure to serve a city but also the plot of the story? How do I optimize the stats for my new character to be a good member of my party? Playing this game teaches you skills like how to solve new and unfamiliar problems with critical reasoning. And today's sponsor Brilliant is there to give you a toolkit and a framework to work through novel problems. They offer a wide range of content building interactive online courses on topics from scientific thinking to math fundamentals, from programming with Python, to machine learning, including probability courses involving dice.

Alright. Onwards and upwards, lookout for a little teaser audio next Tuesday featuring a special guest voice. It is extremely wonderful. And you're going to enjoy it. And then, on April 7th, we are starting with Episode 1. Hang in there everybody. We're here for you. Now, let's get back to the world-building.
Theme Music
Amanda: Okay. We're back. Did you guys enjoy my, my lobster roll that I made for everybody?
Julia: It was delicious.
Brandon: Amanda, you need to open a lobster roll shop immediately.
Amanda: Maybe I will do it. And, so, where in our city?
Julia: In Lake Town City.
Eric: Where dreams come true.
Amanda: My brains, he wants to say, “Yummy, yummy, yummy after you say Lake Town City.”
Julia: Oh, no.
Amanda: Because there was – there must be something I'm thinking of. A commercial or something.
Eric: Lake Town City. Yummy. Yummy.
Julia: Oh, no.
Eric: Alright. We are now in the Third Age. This is 2004 to about 2011-2012. We're calling this the Build.
Julia: The good years.
Eric: We are—
Brandon: Is this when they got rid of the silver standard?
Eric: Yeah. This is the – yeah, this is definitely when we got rid of silver standard. This is where the infrastructure for all the people who’ve come in needs to be repaired and souped-up.
Brandon: So, this is fantasy then.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: We're building a lot of stuff.
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: Alright. This is the Build. The city has experienced a massive influx of people, adding a new neighborhood, a new high school, and a highway or improved public transit.
Julia: Oh.
Brandon: We can improve on the SKY tram. So—
Julia: No, we can add more of them.
Brandon: That's true.
Eric: Yes.
Brandon: More skies.
Julia: More skies.
Eric: We can do it. You can do a different public transit.
Amanda: Another layer on top of the SKY tram. The SKY Tram Tram.
Julia: The Heaven Tram.
Brandon: The SKY SKY Tram Tram.
Amanda: The SKY SKY Tram.
Eric: So, I didn't anticipate that you would come up with the perfect idea. So, yes, you need to have a new defined neighborhood, which can also take space that does not exist or you can encroach on other people's space. And then add another high school and some sort of transportation improvement, whether it is a road or – what else?
Julia: So, I'd like to do a neighborhood. And I would like to add a Art District.
Amanda: Cool.
Brandon: Fun.
Julia: Because we don’t have one of those yet.
Eric: Nice.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: So, I think it would make sense to kind of get it off of the downtown area, especially since we have the Museum of Tomorrow and this awful highway over here. So, I think that it would make sense to kind of put that in the middle of those two things.
Eric: Love it.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Amanda, the road you drew, the squiggly drew, it looks like it's giving me the finger.
Amanda: Oh.
Brandon: Right there.
Amanda: Well, for that, I apologize, Brandon.
Brandon: Oh, very sweet, Julia.
Amanda: Aww. Very nice.
Julia: I did the tragedy in the comedy masks for the Arts District.
Eric: I love all of those neighborhoods that are just like about the direction of it. So, this is south of Little Italy. So, it's Solita or something.
Julia: Oh.
Amanda: Yay.
Brandon: It's the only place you can get a good cocktail in town.
Eric: 100 percent.
Brandon: Every time you walk into a bar in there, you're like, “Do you guys do bowling balls here?” And they're like, “Pfrtt. Nah. Pfrtt.”
Julia: Excuse me sir. You'll get a Mountain Lobster Martini, and you'll like it, sir.
Eric: So, now, add a high school.
Amanda: Well, I was going to mention I love the idea of the Magnet School and maybe the Arts Magnet School that Brandon brought up. So, why don't we add an Arts Magnet School to Solita?
Julia: Heck yeah.
Brandon: I was thinking the same thing I liked that maybe the mayor got pressure eventually to be like, “It’s STEAM not STEM.”
Eric: STEAM not STEM. STEAM not STEM.
Brandon: STEAM not STEM.
Eric: STEAM not STEM.
Brandon: I also want to put forward the idea that you can, for $2 more, put an optional Corona floater in your bowling ball.
Amanda: Yes, Brandon.
Eric: I mean that was always the truth.
Amanda: Brandon, this is the kind of brave innovation that makes you such a valuable member of the team.
Brandon: And, in this era, they now added, optionally, a salted rim.
Amanda: Incredible.
Julia: Alright. So, I added a school-looking—
Brandon: But it’s called Stardust. Sorry.
Julia: I added a school-looking building that had a music note and like an art palette with a paintbrush coming out of it. =
Amanda: Cute.
Brandon: Very good.
Eric: Do we have a name for this one?
Julia: The Palette.
Amanda: Whoa.
Eric: That – that’s only the nickname.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: That’s only the nickname. What's the official name?
Julia: Hmm.
ES: Do you think it's like after a contemporary artist? Or do you think it's like very class call?
Julia: It’s like the Lady Gaga School for the Arts.
Eric: Either – it’s like either that or just like it's fucking Michelangelo, guys.
Julia: I like the Lady Gaga School for the Arts, please.
Brandon: Did she – yeah. Did she endow money upon this town?
Julia: Of course, she did. She and Al Gore are real good friends.
Eric: Alright. So, now, who went last? Did I go last? Could I put the bar?
Julia: Yes.
Brandon: Oh, did we do the transportation?
Julia: No, we didn’t.
Eric: Oh sorry.
Amanda: Well, if the highway bisecting the page was originally just like a two-lane local highway—
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: – we could expand it to be four lanes or something like that.
Brandon: I think it's a good idea. Yeah.
Julia: So, we'll just make it a little thicker.
Eric: I like that those that people who still use cars and want to brave the winter, like, can – now, has a highway. So—
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So, kind of cool.
Amanda: So, I just drew the local teens and young people getting into a new activity. What is it? What businesses spring up to keep them going?
Brandon: Is there a Z on the word teens?
Amanda: No.
Julia: No, I’m up to that.
Brandon: Oh.
Eric: You can imagine it though.
Brandon: Yes, I did.
Eric: Now, you're gonna come up with something that is like Upstate New Yorky or you can come up with something that is like very quintessentially mid-2000s.
Brandon: Smoking.
Julia: What's, what's very like Canadian?
Eric: Could be jewel.
Julia: Because we talked about how the is very close to the Canadian border. So, like, yeah.
Eric: It is. This is very close to Montreal.
Julia: What's a very like Canadian sport, or activity, or something like that?
Amanda: I mean the kids could get really into hockey fandom. And then, like, they actually invest in hockey thing—
Julia: And this is how we get our hockey team.
Amanda: – to diversify the economy. And then, like, a professional hockey team, like, starts practicing there.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: This is how we get our hockey team, Eric.
Eric: That's true. Lake Town City becomes a hockey town. I like that.
Julia: Lake Town City.
Eric: So, what you can do is I would put a hockey rink.
Brandon: We could also just make it like a general sports arena type thing that—
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: – in the offseason isn't necessarily hockey.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Well, we can also do, like, music concerts in there.
Amanda: Yeah, it could be like—
Brandon: Like a multiplexing or something.
Amanda: Exactly. I think that can go across from the rest stop. It can go like kind of right off whatever like I-95, where they get off the main highway. And it's like a whole kind of little complex down here.
Julia: Yeah. And it's a pain in the ass to get to much like many—
Amanda: Yes.
Julia: – New York team stadiums.
Eric: Yeah. This is like the Meadowlands or even Foxboro for New England.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: It's, like, outside of the city.
Brandon: Now, I do want to propose that, during some seasons, they do have roller derby.
Amanda: Yes, like roller derby regional finals.
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: Yes. Love it.
Brandon: Because I love roller derby.
Eric: Oh, 100 percent. I do like that, like, there is no professional team, but they're building it—
Brandon: Oh, wait.
Eric: – on the hope that maybe it will happen.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: No, I don't want it in the big stadium. I think it should go in the actual roller rink.
Julia: Sky view, I’m putting them.
Amanda: Oh, I assumed that there was roller derby.
Eric: Oh, Astros 100 percent does.
Amanda: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Brandon: Cool.
Eric: Alright. Julie, then now your turn.
Julia: Yes. I briefly glanced at mine. And it's like the gods sent it to me. So, it's a heartwarming story captures the entire city's consciousness. What is it? What changes? Or a weird urban legend captures the entire city’s consciousness?
Amanda: Yay.
Julia: What is it? What changes?
Brandon: It's weird it says, Julia.
Amanda: Julia?
Eric: It says Spirits team on it?
Amanda: Julia, is the paper really hot? Is that why you choose it?
Julia: It’s like it's all wet. Why is it so wet?
Brandon: Why is it in your handwriting?
Julia: I don’t know. It's weird how that happened when it's typed.
Amanda: Strange, how that just the or was in pencil and then so was the rest of it.
Julia: Weird, how that happened. Anyway, let's talk about the weird urban legend that’s going on in Laketown. And is it a lake monster?
Brandon: Is it?
Amanda: Is it?
Eric: It could be Lake Monster in Lake Town City. That's a good one. I think that we should spit ball a bunch, because it's like our shit.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yes. Yes.
Eric: So, just like let's throw a lot while I take it down.
Amanda: Okay. It could be like radioactive mountain lobsters.
Julia: Mountain Lobster. Yes.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah. We got forests as well. We got river. We got lake.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: We got tram. Maybe there’s a ghost tram.
Brandon: Maybe there’s was a ghost tram.
Julia: Okay. Okay.
Brandon: It could be something in the shanty town, where there's like abandoned houses.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yeah, someone could have like died constructing the museum.
Brandon: Something could be built on top of something like a – like a waste dumpsite.
Julia: Yeah. I think like really leaning into like nuclear waste, or mutant creatures, or something to that effect—
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: – makes the most sense.
Eric: I think it also definitely has to indict the mad scientist.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Maybe there's a rumor that all mountain lobsters are actually lab grown. Like, they're actually cloned or artificial.
Julia: Mhmm. It's that and also, like, every one in 100 has a weird mutant disease that it transforms into a giant one and like attacks people.
Amanda: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Julia: Because the scientist is still dumping waste into the lake or the river.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah. What if there's like – what if the lake monster – river monster is like just – there's a legend. There's a giant crawfish.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. That like she was trying to breed them to be or like—
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: – genetically engineer them to be like heartier and bigger.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: And then the one got away.
Brandon: Yeah. So, when we started breeding crawfish more, they were like, “Well, instead of more, maybe we just make them bigger and plumper.” And the scientists tried that.
Julia: And then we got giant mutant—
Eric: Cool.
Julia: – lake monster crawfish.
Brandon: Yeah. But that’s not confirmed, right? It's just an urban legend.
Julia: It’s just an urban legend.
Eric: It’s all—
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Can it – can they be named Monty instead of Nessie?
Julia: Yes, we're naming it Monty.
Eric: So, the lake connects to the larger river system so that it's been spotted in various places.
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: Because is not real.
Julia: Yeah, it can move around.
Eric: Right.
Amanda: And, yes, fellow map purists that would make it a cove.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: And not a lake.
Julia: That's fine.
Brandon: Oh, my god.
Eric: It’s should be, but they call it the lake obviously.
Julia: Both signs are nicknamed Monty.
Brandon: Yeah, I like that.
Eric: Very fun.
Julia: So—
Brandon: Or the, like, place on top of that, you know. Like, that wasn't where it originally was.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: So, to represent Monty, the, the crawfish, I drew a very bad crawfish in the Lake Town circle area.
Brandon: Looks good to me.
Amanda: Great.
Brandon: I do want to eat it.
Eric: Now, again, is this – is it crawfish, crayfish? Are they all the same?
Julia: It's all the same really.
Eric: Okay, just checking. I always forget.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: But we're saying—
Eric: Mountain Lobster.
Amanda: Mountain Lobster.
Julia: – Mountain Lobster is the colloquial term.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: 100 percent. Okay. Cool. Brandon, go ahead.
Brandon: I am picking one up. Oh, no. Oh, no.
Julia: Oh, no. What happen?
Brandon: A natural disaster hits the city.
Julia: Oh, no.
Amanda: No.
Brandon: What is it? What does it destroy?
Julia: I don’t want to destroy anything.
Brandon: I don’t want to destroy anything.
Amanda: It’s my perfect town.
Julia: Our perfect little town.
Amanda: Unless, it wrecks the horrible road.
Julia: What? It – mountains slide breaks the horrible road.
Amanda: Is there landslide? Yeah. Rockslide. And it cuts off the middle finger that you hate so much, Brandon.
Julia: That’s over here.
Amanda: Just an option.
Eric: So, what—
Brandon: I was gonna say flood. Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Like, it could be a flood in like February or something.
Julia: Can, can we flood the terrible river though?
Amanda: Well, there are often floods in, like, April and May as the – as the ice melts.
Brandon: Ice melts.
Eric: Okay. Cool.
Brandon: Yeah. I like a flood along the river from, like, outside the map boundary in and sort of like the flood tapers off. So, it didn't actually hit the lake. Like, the lake didn't flood, but the river boundary did.
Julia: Maybe like it creates like marshland too, because we didn't populate that area.
Brandon: That’s what I was gonna say. Yeah. I think it destroys some of the docks, which have been rebuilt.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: And then I think, yeah, the area where the windy road is now become sort of like a little bit swampy and marshy.
Eric: What happens now that there is marshland? Do they real – rebuild this highway and do they rebuild – and how do they rebuild the docks?
Julia: I want to say they don't rebuild the highway, because everyone agreed it was terrible.
Brandon: I agree.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. Maybe Julia's previous idea of turning some old highway into park and, now, it's like kind of a marshy preserve. And that's like a nature trail.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Hmm. It's like a green space.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Perfect.
Brandon: Yeah, I think, as you go further along off the map, it – like, it's worse and worse.
Amanda: Yeah, like into the forest. That’s great.
Eric: Yeah. Okay. So—
Brandon: And I do think they rebuild the docks.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: What's different though?
Julia: I do want to say probably, because they rebuilt the docks, it’s a little bit more structured. And, so, the mafia loses kind of its hold on that area.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Amanda: Cool.
Eric: Okay. So, less – now, there's less organized crime, because the docks are a lot nicer and a lot less shady.
Brandon: Yeah. Maybe they built a dock side or on the dock Astros?
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Uh huh.
Brandon: And it’s like a chain – a chain Astros comes in.
Eric: No, it’s like a navy yard. It's like the navy yard in Brooklyn.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: And put in lighting.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: They're gentrifying the fucking docks.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: And the, the people, literally, are not happy. Yeah.
Amanda: But only some of them. There are still some of the old timey docks.
Brandon: Right.
Amanda: And they're the ones closest to Lake Town.
Brandon: Exactly.
Amanda: So, we do have some.
Brandon: I think they also have a new special drink that's like – did you guys ever have ocean water sonic?
Amanda: No.
Brandon: So, it's like coconut and like lemon lime flavor, but I think they have like a – like a tropical version of the bowling ball.
Julia: Oh, interesting.
Brandon: It’s on the river.
Julia: Like a Baja blast.
Amanda: Like their version of a piña colada.
Brandon: Oh. And maybe they put a little – either like toy or a some sort of edible thing that looks like a little monster crawfish in it.
Julia: Yeah, that’s adorable.
Amanda: Or a Bloody Mary with a crawfish claw.
Brandon: Ooh.
Julia: Ooh. Also, very good.
Amanda: A clawfish.
Julia: It's probably just a full crawfish, because crawfish are like smaller than the size of it. Yeah.
Brandon: Except for Monty.
Julia: Monty is a big, big boy. Bigger than all of us.
Brandon: He’d be delicious to eat.
Julia: He would be delicious to eat. That's the problem.
Amanda: Monty is our king.
Eric: Hmm. Okay. We lost two.
Amanda: Alright.
Eric: So, I'm gonna read two.
Julia: Cool.
Eric: And I promise—
Amanda: He lost it.
Eric: Alright. So, here's—
Brandon: Ugh.
Julia: It’s the sports one, isn’t?
Eric: It is the sports one.
Julia: Oh, motherfucker.
Eric: A sports team is coming to the city. What sport was the team name?
Julia: It’s hockey.
Eric: It – now, because of what you put in that we talked about, it's definitely hockey.
Julia: And it's the Mountain Lobsters.
Eric: It is the Mountain Lobster.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yay.
Eric: I did want—
Julia: And Monty is the –
Brandon: Is Monty is their mascot?
Julia: Yeah, of course.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Yeah, the colors are icy blue.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And pink.
Julia: Interesting.
Eric: With like white and black. Like, white, black, icy blue and then the, the crawfish pink.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Which I really like. And then the name of the stadium is sponsored by one of the local – it’s by, by Thorn Hill.
Julia: Oh, sweet.
Eric: Yes. So, Thorn Hills is the coffee shop that Julia originally made. We were talking about – a little bit about this like franchising out. So, it’s Thorn Hill arena.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Because an arena is usually like indoor.
Julia: I'm so excited.
Brandon: Coffee in every pot.
Amanda: Very good.
Julia: Coffee in every monster.
Amanda: Alright. I will select one of the real slips.
Brandon: No.
Eric: I, I promise I just lost it. I'm so sorry.
Amanda: Alright. So, mine says, a neighborhood expands overtaking another one. What is it? Is there a blend or an erasure of the past one?
Julia: I think it would make sense for the shantytown to spread to the industrial area.
Amanda: Yeah, I think either that or maybe the industrial zone as like there are more and more jobs, depending on whatever is happening with the science thing, they could also expand into kind of West Town.
Brandon: Yeah, that might be interesting, because you could sort of like take some of these old industrial buildings and build lofts for like—
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. Or—
Julia: So, West Town moving into the industrial zone or the industrial zone moving into the Western?
Brandon: I think maybe that blend. I don’t know.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Industrial into West Town. And I think, yeah, like, maybe this is like coming to the late odds, right?
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: So, maybe there are, you know, like, artisanal pickles and local coffee—
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: – and more of a true blend of those two ideologies. That would be kind of cool.
Eric: Hmm. Now, what I want to do is I want to create a new neighborhood, which is the fusion which is like the super hipstery area.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, now, we have this gentrified area, which literally used to be nothing until now. And that is like the – it is the true like hipstery thing here.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Well, instead there was like a more of an agricultural crunchy thing in West Town.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: And, now, is industrial. So, like we're talking like fucking Bushwick right now.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Right.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: What did you make for your hipster segment?
Amanda: The tiara pickles.
Julia: Oh, my gosh. Amanda has strong feelings on how pickles look.
Amanda: Well, it has a little label on the jar.
Julia: Oh, of course.
Eric: Can I make a – can I make a suggestion?
Amanda: What?
Eric: It’s that the Astros is now in the hipster area.
Amanda: Cool.
Julia: You think it moved or you think there’s an additional one?
Eric: It didn’t move. It's just like – it's just like—
Amanda: It got et.
Eric: It got et up.
Julia: Oh.
Eric: That's the main thing that made West Town cool is now in the cool neighborhood.
Brandon: Yeah. But they go to Astros like ironically, because like, you know—
Eric: Exactly.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Got it.
Amanda: So, our new neighborhood expands out from industrial zone across the new efficient road and then kind of hugging the edge of that road all the way down to the left-hand side of the map almost to the rest stop.
Julia: What do we want to call the hipster area?
Brandon: Brooklyn.
Amanda: No, Brooklyn.
Julia: Well, I, I like the idea of like, like, Westownville or something like that. You know what I mean?
Eric: How about Astroville?
Amanda: Maybe it's Thornhill starts doing their own roasting and selling their products online.
Julia: Oh, interesting.
Amanda: So, maybe it's like Thorn space Hill, Thorn Hill.
Julia: I like that.
Eric: I like Thorn Hill. That's good.
Julia: Write it down. So, we don't forget.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Do we want put like a new flagship Thorn Hill store in there as well?
Julia: Oh, yeah. Like—
Brandon: Oh, like the, the Starbucks Reserve.
Amanda: The Roastery.
Eric: Yeah. Or like the Court—
Julia: Right next to—
Amanda: Julia, you, you take care of that.
Eric: – which is now corporate office. Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: There you go.
Eric: Wonderful. Julia, it is now your turn.
Julia: Oh, Okay.
Brandon: I just want everyone to know that the bowling balls in that area, everyone knows that they're a little watered down.
Julia: Oh, it’s a shame.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: You're so invested in Astros.
Amanda: Always the bottom line.
Julia: Ooh, a group explores the city more thoroughly and finds something that had been previously overlooked. What is it?
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: A go-go-go-ghost.
Julia: The ghost.
Amanda: It could be a natural resource. It could be like an old business and old history.
Eric: It could be inner city or it can be on the outer reaches of the city, however, you choose.
Julia: Oh, actually, that kind of brings me to my point. I like the idea of doing something with the forest area down here that's now bordering the marsh area from the flood. I'm just not entirely sure what is – what it's going to be.
Amanda: Maybe there is like an old mine, or old like fur trapper hats, or like mushroom, or a truffle, or some kind of—
Julia: More food things.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia:Yes.
Amanda: Maybe there are truffles there. Like, Eric got me a book that have people murder each other about truffles in France. It's wild. It's a real thing.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: This could also have to do with the expansion of organized crime.
Julia: Yes. Okay. So, it's not truffles.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: But it's like something as like the new – it's the American truffle.
Eric: But I think this is related to – Brandon, please read the next slip.
Brandon: The next slip says, “Where is the city underbelly in the city?”
Julia: Wow.
Brandon: What crime sustains them?
Amanda: I just really want a mushroom syndicate.
Julia: So, I think that it was in the Little Italy for a very long time, because that is where the docks are located. And I think that, now, like, fully in the space where, in the Marshland, you know, they used to do like rhum running—
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: – on like the bayous and stuff and use like fan boats and whatnot—
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: – to like run things back and forth. And I love the idea of, instead of using the river, using the marshland to bring stuff up to the docks.
Amanda: Cool.
Julia: And then bring that back down to New York City. Truffle running.
Eric: I wonder if we have the mafia, the Italian Mafia, on one side and, now, we have another crime syndicate.
Amanda: Oh, interesting.
Eric: Like, do we have the – and Brandon, I think you should run with this, because this is your poll. But, like, who is the other city – and we had a city underbelly. Let's make another one. What is their crime? And it doesn't have to be as – it doesn't have to be organized. It can be something maybe a little more sporadic and give me like a smaller crew or whatever.
Amanda: Eco, eco-related stuff. Like fertilizers that aren't regulated or like a growth hormone for plants. That’s where my mind goes.
Brandon: Hmm. That's interesting. Okay. Yeah. So, here's my thought. I think there is an organization of, like, quasi eco-terrorists.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: That control the mushroom trade, because they sell it to the restaurants in town. That's how they get their funding. And they use that money to – we don't know exactly what they're doing. But I think they're funding potential technology weapons. Like, maybe they're trying to build a particle accelerator or something. I think they're also using that money to, like, bribe politicians to get what they want. Like, I think they're using – no one's quite sure exactly what they're doing with the money yet. But I do think they are selling – like, their, their laundering scheme is to sell these American truffles to the restaurants.
Amanda: Cool.
Eric: 100 percent. I love that.
Julia: Love it.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And they're using, like, eco science and tech to make it happen.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: And they're, like, very moralistic. Like, they're like—
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: – you know, this is – this is for the good of the society.
Amanda: Right.
Eric: Good.
Amanda: Like, I could see someone like that being motivated to, like, kill all non-native species of plants.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: And it's like, “Whoa, buddy. Like, that's not – that's not small potatoes.”
Brandon: Do I have to draw that somehow?
Eric: Yeah. So, draw – why don't you draw like their hideout in the truffle area?
Amanda: Julia, I like your mushroom. They’re so cute.
Julia: Thank you.
Brandon: I'm just gonna build a house around the mushrooms.
Eric: Sounds good to me.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: Like they can be – that's their warehouse.
Julia: So good.
Amanda: A mushroom hut.
Julia: May I also stake a claim for the mafia truffle syndicate hangout to be like here.
Eric: Yeah, absolutely.
Brandon: Yeah. Maybe—
Amanda: The mafia resell downstate.
Brandon: I was gonna say maybe they – maybe they – the mushroom – the mafia are like the middlemen for the American.
Eric: Remember—
Amanda: So, they can – like, they can hide their involvement.
Brandon: Right.
Eric: Remember New York City still exists.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: If that helps.
Julia: And New York City wants those American truffles real bad.
Brandon: Yeah, I don’t think the eco-terrorists have the distribution network that the mafia has.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah, totally.
Eric: Definitely.
Amanda: Love it.
Eric: Alright. We are now in the final age, the New Age.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: This is going to start in 2013 and continue to 2020, whatever that means to us and wherever we're gonna pick up.
Julia: Present day.
Eric: Yes, thank you. To present day. Here's the era event. Finally, the state has approved our plans for a high speed train to New York City.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: Where is the station?
Julia: Oh, interesting. Ooh. May I suggest terrible visitor center that has been there since the 80s gets turned into big train station.
Amanda: Ooh. I'm into it. I think then we probably expand and add a new or a bigger tram stop.
Brandon: Sky Tram. Yeah.
Amanda: But people can take that into the city center.
Julia: Right.
Amanda: Go for it, Jules.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Can we do this the reverse of Penn Station where, instead of knocking down a beautiful example of like 18th-century architecture or next century architecture, they instead like build like a Nouveau Greco-Roman, like, Grand Vanderbilt Carnegie era train station.
Julia: Yeah. I love it.
Brandon: I like that.
Eric: For sure.
Amanda: But it encloses – instead of the Grand Central clock, we got that lobster. He's right in the middle. Welcome.
Julia: And then, also, right across from it, I am adding a secondary tram stop.
Amanda: Tight.
Julia: So, that people could easily get to it.
Eric: What else now pops up? Because there is a – the high-speed rail from New York City on the outskirts of town.
Brandon: I mean tourism.
Amanda: Hotels.
Brandon: Hotels. Yeah.
Eric: Alright. So, let's make this into a – into a neighborhood that is based around the high-speed rail.
Brandon: I think it, also, yeah, would become a commuter haven for New York City workers.
Eric: I think this also might include the arena.
Julia: Yes.
Brandon: And this neighborhood is terrible.
Amanda: So—
Julia: No one likes it.
Amanda: Yeah. Maybe there's a waterpark. Those happen a lot in the high – along the highways of Upstate.
Brandon: In, in, in the frozen tundra there.
Julia: They’re indoor.
Amanda: Indoor park.
Eric: In Erie, Pennsylvania, the most rustbelt ass town of all time, there is a indoor waterpark called Splashdown.
Brandon: Yeah, I think these, these kind of people that live here now – like, they do live here, but they are the kind of people that don't take any pride in where they live or the city. They’re just sort of like, “This is where I've sat down.” And, so, like the rest of the town is like – even the people who are in the newly – like relatively new developed area are, like, “You're not Lake Town Citiers.”
Eric: I don't think they want to be.
Brandon: Right.
Julia: No.
Eric: They're only there for the jobs and because they got forced to.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I'm also sure that like, with the new development, there's a lot of companies that are like, “Okay, now we're gonna put a company – a thing in there.”
Brandon: Yeah, for sure.
Eric: For sure.
Amanda: Alright. So, I will draw our first slip of the last era. So, this says what is the city missing? Add whatever you'd like.
Julia: Oh, what is it missing, guys?
Amanda: I think it is missing a – like hospital, research university, and like major – like Cleveland Clinic style. Like regional excellence in medical care.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: To expand on that further, big college campus.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah, I think it will go in our top-left corner—
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: – we're pretty empty. Kind of north of Hippieville. And I'm going to draw – maybe there's couple of universities and like a big hospital.
Julia: Uh, huh.
Amanda: You guys feel good about that?
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah, I love that—
Julia: That’s like the college town area.
Eric: Oh, my god. I fucking love that.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Because, you know, they definitely need some affordable part in there.
Brandon: Thorn Hill—
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: – now carries textbooks.
Julia: There you go.
Eric: It's Thorn Hill University, but now there's Sunni Lake Town City.
Julia: Oh, hell yes. Add both of those.
Brandon: I would also like to posit that the original incident townies who were involved in it get free college.
Eric: 100 percent.
Julia: 100 percent.
Eric: 100 percent. What about – isn't it the ultimate legacy that, like your, your parents were there during the fucking inciting incident?
Amanda: So, I've drawn, at the top-left corner of the map, a university in sort of like old school style, a gross looking Sunni building because lots of the Sunnis have bad architecture from the ‘70s, a hospital, and then a little bit of like student housing to kind of indicate that there's a lot of, like, apartments and kind of more affordable housing in this zone.
Julia: Sure.
Eric: Hell yeah. Love it.
Julia: Alright. It's my turn.
Amanda: Yes.
Julia: Of course, what is the newest food craze in the city?
Amanda: Yay.
Julia: Who makes it best? Who makes it second best?
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: Ooh.
Julia: So, I think this is where we need to establish our protein, right?
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: Yep.
Brandon: It's got to be bad row.
Julia: Astros makes it terribly, but everyone goes there drunk.
Amanda: Yep.
Brandon: Yeah, because it's the original.
Amanda: Yep. Yep. Yep.
Eric: But there are definitely people from Montreal who come down—
Julia: Oh, yeah.
Eric: – to do it now.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Now, they’re – we have – maybe we can get some cool baker, some French people—
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: – in the mix.
Julia: I'm gonna throw that actually in our newly established college area town.
Amanda: Hell yeah.
Eric: Yes.
Amanda: Took the words right out of my mouth.
Brandon: Can I—
Eric: I love how the colleges now like quasi Quebec.
Brandon: Can I propose that Astros now has a range of bowling balls in different weights? So, you can—
Julia: Ooh.
Brandon: You can get a five-pound bowling ball, which is like the drink. You can get like the six-pound bowling ball, which is like – it's a bowling ball, but it's filled with gravy and fries and cheese curds.
Julia: Oh, god.
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: And then you can add up to like an eight-pound ball, which is like got crayfish and other bullshit in it.
Amanda: Loaded poutine.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Oh, my god.
Julia: Alright. So, I added a little tray of poutine to the top of the far top there.
Amanda: Excellent.
Eric: So, Astros makes it second best. So, what is the name of this poutine place?
Julia:Oh. Oh, there was a place in Boston if I could name it after that.
Eric: Please.
Julia: Which is just called Saus, but it's, S – A – U – S.
Eric: Oh, my god. I love that.
Amanda: Love it.
Eric: Yeah, for sure.
Julia: And you would go to Saus. Saus.
Eric: Write that down.
Julia: Alright.
Eric: Because I don't want to forget that. So, Saus makes it the best, but Astros’ make it second best. 100 percent.
Julia: Yes.
Brandon: Do this place like – do they make like a poutine sandwich too?
Julia: They might.
Brandon: That sounds like someone call Sham do.
Julia: I feel like I’d eat that. Like a poutine burrito?
Brandon: Yeah, that's it.
Amanda: Ooh.
Julia: It’s gotta be wrapped in something.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: For the poutine lover on the go.
Brandon: Yeah. Like, they make a breakfast poutine wrap with like eggs and poutine and a burrito.
Julia: Yes, very good.
Brandon: I actually would eat that.
Julia: Like a poutine po’ boy.
Brandon: Yeah, sounds good.
Julia: Alright.
Brandon: Oh, it's my turn.
Julia: Your poll, bud.
Brandon: Oh, interesting. Who is the current mayor? For how long? What was their platform?
Eric: So, again, when I – we started in like the turn of the early 90s, the mad scientist was the mayor. And it sounds like she was the mayor for a while. But, now, is it different? Is she still the mayor? Who – or is there like an upstart? Who is the mayor now? How do you think we should change it?
Brandon: I would imagine that the mad scientist is still, mainly, because two reasons. One, the people who actually live in the town want to try to maintain control of their town. So, they would put an original townie in leadership.
Amanda: Sure.
Brandon: And then, two, she would become so integrated into global politics that she is their keystone to make staying relevant in the world.
Eric: 100 percent. I think that New York State changed the capital of New York from Albany to Lake Town City as an idea of futurism as a representation of the state in the country. And, now, whatever happened during the inciting incident where there has to be federal people, because we historically closed off Laketown, the historic district, in all of these deals that we've been talking about and how the environmental people are involved. And I think then she is, in fact, the liaison with the larger federal government.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: I do, however, like the idea that maybe she has like a challenger on the horizon.
Eric: Yeah, for sure.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Julia: Yeah. Like, someone who's come in who is new, but, like, is, is raising questions and concerns about her and also like suggesting ideas that people are excited about.
Eric: That's interesting.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: I would ask Brandon a question first. And then we'll go to there.
Julia: Sure.
Eric: Do you think she has the same platform? It's all about, like the futurism and being the City of Tomorrow.
Julia: Crowded in every pot.
Brandon: Yeah. I mean you can't get rid of that. That's just genius.
Eric: It's okay if the answer is yes. I just – I have a follow up question if it is yes.
Brandon: I think it's similar, but I think it's like an evolved platform of, like, Yesterday's Promise Today and Tomorrow. Like, it's a maintaining of this prominence in the country.
Amanda: Right.
Eric: So, let's make our challenger. Who do you think is challenging her? Why? And what was their job before?
Brandon: I think it's some – like senator from the city or something. Someone who's like 32 and really handsome and, like, sort of like a Trudeau type, where they just, like, come into town and charm everyone. And they're like, “Oh, I'll put two lobsters in your pot,” kind of thing. Everyone – or even like an Obama type figure where, like, it's just super charismatic. And everyone sort of falls in love with them.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Right.
Julia: And, also, like, coming in and being like, “Well, you know, the, the promise of the future In the 90s is not the promise of the future in 2020.”
Brandon: Right. Yeah.
Eric: Exactly.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Okay. So, where do we think this person comes from? I think let's make a – let's draw on the map this person's representation if the mayor stays as the mayor.
Amanda: I think it's possible they were previously a town council representative in, like, somewhere like Long Island City in Queens, where they helped oversee a real transition from like, you know, faded industrial zone to like mad condos.
Julia: How do we feel about them moving into our commuter town then?
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. And I mean the commuter town, to a challenger, would be a great example of the fact that, like, unthinking growth isn't good for a place.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: I’m just gonna put a little American flag in the middle.
Amanda: Nice.
Eric: That’s good. Dope. Alright. We only have two more things left. It's my turn. The city finishes a long term public works project. What is it? When was it started? Oh, man. What kind of fucking boondoggle did the – has the mad scientist been trying to doing for such long time.
Brandon: May I suggest tunnels?
Eric: Ha.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: I think there needs to be, like, a scientific research center that's like very kind of, like, cloaked and just like, “What do we do in the future?” And maybe it was like – it was – oh, maybe it was always trying to be developed in where the colleges are. And, now, the colleges sprung up around it. And she's like, “Shit,” you know. It’s like, “Oh, it's also finished. And, now, I guess a lot of young people are around it. Oh, okay.”
Julia: Oops.
Eric: Oops. And there's like a lot of, like, secret. There's like a lot of locked doors. And I think there's a lot of, like, secret stuff in there.
Amanda: Alright.
Eric: So, I want to put a scientific research center where the university is.
Julia: Do it.
Eric: Lots of eyewash stations.
Julia: So many.
Amanda: Beakers and beakers.
Julia: Those emergency shower thing.
Brandon: No.
Amanda: Satellite dish.
Julia: I can’t tell if it’s an atom or a satellite dish from here, but it’s very good.
Eric: Yeah, I put a satellite dish on top of a box, but I put Xs on the windows so people can't look in.
Amanda: Ooh.
Julia: Incredible.
Brandon: Satellite hat?
Eric: It’s a satellite hat. And, finally—
Julia: You got this.
Eric: Oh, man. I know which one this is. I’m so excited for you.
Julia: Which one is it?
Amanda: A series of bank robberies take place over a summer. Who is committing them? What is their MO?
Brandon: Geez.
Eric: Maybe we don't – the people don't know who they are, but I say creators know who they are.
Brandon: Throw out some options. Is it the eco terrorists? Is it some new villain group?
Julia: The Mafia?
Brandon: The Mafia?
Julia: The Punks?
Brandon: Is it the Punks? Yeah, that's fun. Is it—
Julia: A bunch of college students.
Brandon: Sentient monsters?
Julia: It might be a Monty.
Brandon: It might be a Monty in a hat.
Amanda: It might be Monty. Who can say? Monty’s grandkids maybe. Who can say? I think this is some kids who are living now in original Laketown, in the historic district.
Eric: Mhmm.
Julia: Oh, interesting.
Amanda: Who feel strongly that they are not fully, like, benefiting from all of the prosperity that is happening around them. So, they do some bank robberies. And their MO is to wear masks – Monty masks that they get at the rest stop. And they go in on skateboards and then skate away really quickly.
Julia: This is just Anara. What you just described? Just Anara.
Brandon: I don't – I don't know skateboards are most efficient escape system.
Julia: Students.
Eric: It can be like scientific – like futuristic like hover boards and shit.
Julia: Hover boards.
Amanda: I think they can like jack – like, with an app or something, they can like jack the bike share or scooter share. And then they, like, escape on those, abandon them, hop on a tram, and then like go to wherever they have to go.
Brandon: They’re techno hackers. Techno crimes.
Julia: I’m into it.
Eric: Techno crimes. Can I make a suggestion? That they are the descendants of Ma’s Ice Cream Shop. They're Ma’s kids.
Julia: All about it.
Amanda: I think they're Ma’s nephews’ kids.
Eric: What if they're called The Nephews or something.
Amanda: I think these are the kids that hang out on the dock at night. And they live in various places, but that is where they convene to plot to their, their crimes. So, they are the Dock Rats.
Brandon: May I suggest that they've also – maybe they steal from the eco-terrorists or like the eco-tourists were like, “Alright. Here's a laser weapon?” I don't know.
Eric: I do think I did like the eco-terrorists being floaters because I liked how they were not affiliated with the mafia. So, I have no problem with them giving them tech as well.
Amanda: Yeah, I think like someone's cousin is like in the eco-activist group. I don't think they would call themselves that.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: So, I'm going to – I'm gonna draw jewel on the dock.
Eric: I love that. Alright. That is the end of the Map Game. I want everyone here—
Brandon: Map Game. Map Game.
Julia: And what good map.
Eric: Alright. So, what – how do we feel? What do we think about our city?
Julia: I feel great. I'm really excited to explore it as a character.
Brandon: I'm super excited to go to Astros and get two bowling balls; one with poutine and one with alcohol.
Julia: I'm getting – I'm getting that, that mountain lobster slice.
Brandon: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah, I'm stoked. I want to visit this town.
Eric: For sure. This is so good. I'm – I am truly so excited.
Julia: I'm extremely excited.
Eric: So, we're gonna post the photos of both the town and the city on the Instagram and on the internet. And, also, we can find it on the website. And it's gonna be linked to the episode description here. So, you can follow along. I'm ready to introduce your characters and let them loose on the city.
Amanda: I know you'll find out in two weeks what our characters are and what role they play in Lake Town City.
Brandon: I'm so excited to play the mayor.
Eric: That’s not – Brandon, you're not being the mad scientist.
Julia: I like – I like it though, Brandon. Push for it.
Eric: Oh, god. I'm ready. Yeah, Episode 1, two weeks.
Amanda: Alright. We'll see you then.
Brandon: Bye.
Amanda: Bye.
Julia: Bye.
Eric: Yesterday's Promise: Today and Tomorrow.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Guys, I really like maps.
Julia: Shocking.
Amanda: That's my cold open. I just really like them. And I'm really excited that we're all gathered around the table with some blank paper in front of it. It's a metaphor. It's optimism. It's endless possibility. It's charting our own course. It’s Join the Party Season II.
Julia: I can't believe we're starting the episode with this shocking revelation about you and Max.
Brandon: I didn't think we were gonna do True Crime so early or Life with Multitude.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Where you start with the solution? Is that how True Crime does --
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. Good.
Eric: Plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink. I met Amanda when she was looking at a map. Plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink.
Amanda: There was a sale at the Shrimp Shack.
Eric: Plink, plink, plink, plink. All right. So, the reason why we are all gathered here is we are going to play a map making game to establish the town and then eventual city that we are going to live, and breathe, and play in in Join the Party Campaign 2, The Join Campaign. I've been thinking about this a lot in terms of title. And I --
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: That’s a reveal.
Eric: So the last thing – the last one was The Party Campaign. I think this is the Join Campaign. And then all of the titling is gonna be Join the or Join something.
Julia: So, Season III is gonna be The.
Brandon: Season III, The – The campaign.
Julia: The. Cool.
Eric: If we get to Season III, I'm going to do something different.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Oh, I can't wait. So, wait, do you mean that we are going to be basing our campaign around one city instead of a traditional adventuring map with many cities?
Eric: Yes, because we are in a modern campaign, I do want to keep it a little tighter to give you more of a space in which to live and work in and for people to understand you. And we're gonna end up talking about this a little later, but I'm shooting for like a city somewhere in between the size of Pittsburgh to Portland. So, Pittsburgh is, like, 200, 000 to 300,000 people, and Portland is, like, 600,000. So, like, in terms of size, I'd say, like, Level C. Like, if New York City and LA is A. And then, like, Chicago and Dallas and Philadelphia is B. I'm gonna shoot for, like, a C-sized level city.
Julia: Okay.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: I like it.
Eric: So, the way that we're going to do this is I did a games thing.
Amanda: Of course, you did.
Julia: Yay.
Eric: I did.
Brandon: The Gamesman did the games thing?
Eric: The gamesman did the games thing. That's true.
Amanda: Strikes again.
Brandon: Eric, why are you wearing a cape?
Eric: I'm always wearing a cape. This is actually the --
Amanda: Eric, where did you get that Zorro mask? Is it on sale after Halloween?
Eric: Well, everyone --
Brandon: Put the blade away.
Julia: I like the rapier actually.
Eric: No one knows that I'm not using this stuff at all times.
Amanda: It is weird that he carries an adventurer’s pack with him everywhere he is.
Eric: Listen, you --
Julia: It’s just a lot of rope.
Eric: You'll never know when you'll need rope, and candles, and caltrops.
Amanda: Yeah, but, like, why does adventurer’s pack have 10 darts in it?
Brandon: Why does it have 14 things of Chapstick?
Amanda: I don’t know.
Eric: That's your – that’s your backpack.
Brandon: Oh, right.
Julia: So chapped all the time.
Eric: Totally different thing.
Julia: All the time.
Amanda: I do keep a tube of chopstick in the pocket of every coat I own --
Julia: And as you should.
Amanda: -- and always the left one.
Brandon: Oh, that's just smart.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: 14 is a bit excessive.
Amanda: I don't think I have 14 coats. No.
Eric: So, this has nothing to do with the game that I came up with.
Amanda: Yes.
Julia: Tell us about the game.
Eric: All right. So, I love Avery Adler. She is one of my favorite game designers, game creators. And she created a game called A Quiet Year, which is all about mapmaking and building community from scratch over the course of the year. And she also has a game called Monsterhearts, where you play as a teenage monster in, like, a high schoolish world. Very Riverdale. Very melodramatic.
Julia: My real life.
Eric: Yes, where Julia is just a ghoul in a love triangle.
Julia: Mhmm. Yep. That was my high school experience.
Eric: Sounds about right. I really like the way that Avery allows players to be a part of the math making. Even though there is a DM or GM or someone who's running the show, it's really about everybody putting the stuff together. So, I did hack a lot of the stuff from A Quiet Year in the ethos that's inspired from Monsterhearts for all of us to put this together and make it. So, there is gonna be some reading. Also, this is the first time that all of us have done this. I have not told Amanda, Julia, or Brandon how we're going to do this. I did introduce kind of the history that doesn't really affect them as people. They have, like, a rough idea. And I'm not really gonna get into those events, but I am going to give events that are going to spur all of us to be map makers together and how we're going to chart the course of this small town becoming a larger city. So, I'm going to read out the document that I created. I'm definitely gonna post this document later in the episode description. So, you guys can all kind of follow along as well. So, welcome to The Map Game.
Amanda: Ooh.
Brandon: Thank you for welcoming me.
Eric: There you go.
Amanda: Hello.
Eric: I also wrote in, “Let everyone say hello back to me.”
Amanda: We did.
Brandon: Hello.
Julia: I just sang Map Game at you. Is that okay?
Eric: Map game. Yeah, that's acceptable.
Julia: Cool.
Brandon: Map Game.
Eric: Yeah, there it is. The plan is to create a small town together. And then we're going to slowly grow it over four periods totaling three decades. So, we're going to shoot from 1988 to 2020, where are we going to end and where the campaign is going to pick up.
Amanda: Wait, it's 2020. We're living in the future.
Eric: Right now, it's 2019. When people are listening, it's gonna be the future.
Julia: The City of Tomorrow.
Amanda: City on the move.
Eric: So, we're – Jesus Christ. So, we have two maps in front of us. They are these two blank pieces of paper. The, first, we're going to turn into the small town in which we start. And then, on the second map, we're going to use the small town as a locus point to grow a big city around it. So, since we're all doing this together, our roles aren't to control specific characters or necessarily act out specific scenes where you own characters. Instead, we all act as abstract social forces within the community. At any point we might be representing a single person or a great many. This is a story about social forces and their impact on land rather than being about specific individuals. However, if specific individuals come up, we'll make sure to note them. As we introduce interesting challenges for the community and then figure out how to address them, tensions will emerge that ultimately reveal the character and future of the community. One of the players will be acting as a closet DM, which is me, as I've prepared the events that delineate what the eras are. And I have some ideas about what the reasons are of why things are happening. I'm also gonna introduce some characters and some elements that I want your opinion on as we establish the setting for the campaign. We're gonna be using this as an introduction to D&D. So, it may feel a touch railroaded, but only because we all kind of agreed on what the larger history would be. So, I feel pretty secure that we're on the same page. And I feel like everyone kind of bought in, which is different than what a usual game of A Quiet Year where you start from scratch and everyone needs to, like, have a conversation.
Amanda: So, basically, instead of like coming to session one, and you giving us a map, and then figuring out what happened, we get to make the map with you. And then, in session one, we figure out why all those things happen.
Eric: Exactly.
Brandon: How to break your map.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Or how to live in it and how you are going to put other things in there.
Amanda: Brandon, I think we have different philosophies of D&D.
Eric: I don’t know how you could break a city. I think –
Brandon: Is on the challenge?
Eric: I'm making this too big that Brandon can't ruin it. It's like, “Well, Brandon's character destroyed the bridge, I guess.”
Julia: Whoops.
Brandon: Whoops.
Julia: These things happen.
Eric: So, the first thing we're going to do is establish the town map. We are now going to start the game, guys.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yay.
Brandon: Yay.
Eric: So, we're gonna establish the landscape. As we play, we're going to add to this map to reflect the town's growth and the decisions we make along the way. We talked about starting our town as a summer community of about 100 families. So, let's talk about where the houses go. Where were the summer community be centered around or near? In Lake Placid, there's a lake. Maybe you’d like – is it around a forest? Is it around a river? What do you think is, like, the central feature of this neighborhood?
Julia: I got to go lake.
Brandon: I mean, yeah, it has to be water of some kind.
Julia: Got to be lake.
Amanda: I’m into it.
Eric: Yeah, a lake’s fine.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Like river, either one.
Brandon: Maybe it's a lake that feeds into an ocean or some other larger body.
Amanda: It could be like an eddy of a river. Like a river and then it has a little like cove almost that the town is centered around.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: Yes, I did send you guys the map before. So, it's – what's interesting about this is that this town is very close to the Hudson River, which, for those of you don't know, runs on the right side of New York State in between New York and Vermont and Connecticut and all those other states over there. So, we're going to be pretty high north. So, this is going to be the division between New York State and Vermont. So, this totally can lead into the river --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- if that's what – something that we’re interested in.
Julia: I think that does make sense --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: -- from just like a – if a major city is going to develop around it, you need to have a port of call so to speak.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So, like, you need to have a way for them to transport things in and out that isn't just by, like, rail.
Brandon: Yeah, I think it has to. Like, even, even today, now, like, something like – I'm making this up, but something like 70 or 80 percent or whatever of international trade is by boat. And I assume, if we're going to do the Clean Energy type game, some of that would be shipped internationally too.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: So, we'd have to have some sort of port.
Eric: Sounds good to me. All right. Cool. So, for everybody, we're gonna post the photos of this map as well. So, I made a small lake in the middle of the piece of paper. I'm just using regular computer paper. I put a small lake in the middle with a little tributary that is going to eventually lead back to the river. And I made little boxes with hats on them to represent the larger houses. I assume that – and this might be a thing that – since I've been to Lake Placid and I know Amanda has as well. Like, there's a lot of houses that are directly on the lake.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Or some that are a little bit behind. So, I'm just representing them with the – these little housing things that are around. Another thing about A Quiet Year, which I love, is that, like, you don't have to be good at drawing. It's just like enough to represent the thing that we're doing. We're really going to try not to use words. And it's all gonna be like cartography, and simple symbols, and things that we might understand.
Brandon: I like this idea of, like, how to – how to draw a house. Square with hat.
Eric: Square with hat.
Amanda: It's right.
Eric: And, now, we're gonna go around and introduce one detail about the local terrain, either it's gonna be natural or manmade. And then you're going to draw that onto the map. So, anyone can go, because I already did my thing. So, I want you all to have a shot to put something in this town. It could either be, like, an environmental thing. Like, “Oh, there's a hill over there. There's a different river that leads into the Hudson. Or there's, like, a big rock that people sit on.” And then – but also you can put stuff in the town. Like, I don't want to name businesses, but, like, little – either a business, or a service, or a different neighborhood that's a kind of a place that's off of it. So, go ahead.
Julia: So, we have a lot of residential area over here. I think it would make sense to have sort of a business district.
Eric: Mhmm.
Julia: And I think it makes sense to kind of locate the business district on either the north or south end of the river leading into the lake.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Because that's kind of the drive into town. And then, if we have the residential surrounding the lake, you know, we're driving in and out of town to get to the businesses. So, what do we think? North or south?
Amanda: I think, if we're talking about New York State, people tend to drive from the south of the state north. So, I think it makes sense to have the town on the south side of the river.
Julia: OK.
Brandon: Julia is drawing one long rectangle. And she's dividing it into multiple boxes.
Amanda: Like little Main Street.
Brandon: Little Main Street.
Eric: I like that.
Amanda: Yeah. Cool.
Brandon: Cool. Yeah. I think I'm gonna do a geological feature.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: I think there's gonna be some sort of like elevation among these houses. So, generally speaking, at least in the like late town communities that I've seen, there's, like, the normal wealthy houses. And then there's, like, the ones that are, like – oh, like, Bill Gates definitely lives in that house, right?
Eric: 100 percent.
Amanda: Yeah, like in the hills surrounding the town.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: It’s the one with the view always.
Amanda: Oh, with view, yeah.
Brandon: Yeah. So, the – because the river is leading to the center of the page from the right of the page – and this is a portrait style paper. On the left quadrant, I'm gonna make a sort of a hill over here.
Eric: Nice.
Brandon: And it's gonna sort of be sectioned off from the --
Amanda: Cool.
Brandon: -- rest of the town.
Amanda: It's like the opposite side as the river.
Eric: Like, the left houses are, like, elevated?
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Oh, so, it kind of overlooks the lake and also the business district. I like that.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: That is cool.
Amanda: Nice.
Julia: Cute little town.
Amanda: Can I do like a public service?
Eric: Yeah. No, that sounds great.
Amanda: Knowing, you know, summer towns as well, there's always kind of like the townie part, where maybe tourists come in for the summer and hang out on Main Street, but the townies are somewhere else. So, on the left hand side of the lake, kind of near the base of the mountain range that Brandon just indicated, I want to do like a public dock and kind of swimming zone, where townies go to, like, you know, launch their kayaks into the lake or hang out or go drink at night.
Eric: Sounds good.
Amanda: So, I just drew a little dock. It looks kind of, like, a centipede.
Julia: Oh, yeah.
Amanda: On the left hand side of the lake.
Brandon: Oh, no, giant bugs.
Amanda: A little bit – a little bit below the foothills of Brandon's mountain range.
Eric: Wonderful. I did the lake in the middle. So, I'm gonna take the first crack at the businesses.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: I want there to be, like, a really small Public Library.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I feel like, especially when you're up this far, like, you need to have a public library in at least the cute small town nearby, because there's only so many in all these places. So, I'm gonna pick this one. And I like – it's like we're zooming in on it like when you're looking at New England. It’s like, “Oh, that is where Delaware is. I didn’t even know that. So, I'm gonna pull that out. And I'm gonna make a book.
Amanda: So, Eric's doing a little bit toward the right hand side of town but very in the middle of the Main Street.
Eric: And then I think it's just gonna be the name of town public library. And we are gonna get naming the town later.
Julia: Excellent.
Amanda: In actual Lake Placid, the ice cream shop used to be next to the library. So, I would love to put an ice cream shop right next to the library right in the middle of town.
Julia: Do a little cone.
Amanda: I like to do a little cone.
Eric: You have a name for the ice cream shop.
Amanda: Ma’s.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: It's Ma's Ice Cream Shop.
Julia: So, for the shop closest to the lake, Amanda took me to a very, very good coffee shop when I was in Lake Placid for my bachelorette party.
Eric: Oh, that place is dope.
Julia: It is very, very good. It's very like farmy in a lot of ways. And, so, I kind of imagine everyone goes there for their morning coffee kind of thing. And there's always like cute little pastries and croissants and whatnot.
Amanda: I love it.
Julia: And they make it dope. Like, really thick hot chocolate.
Amanda: Nice.
Julia: I'm going to name it Thorn Hills.
Eric: Thorn Hills Coffee.
Amanda: Love it.
Julia: What are you gonna add, Brandon?
Brandon: The thing that was always in these like suburban Texan towns, because every Texan town likes to think that they're still from, like, the 1950s. So, there's always either a roller rink or a bowling alley.
Eric: Bowling alley
Julia: Or a combo roller rink and bowling alley?
Amanda: I got my roller rink. I got my bowling spot. I got my combination roller rink and bowling spot.
Julia: I got my bowling alley. I got my combination roller rink and bowling spot.
Brandon: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, they're a roller rink.
Amanda: Yes, Brandon.
Brandon: Tuesday, Thursday, they just bowl on rink.
Amanda: This is the kind of innovation that you bring to the Join the Party team.
Brandon: Yeah, I think it's actually probably almost like on the outskirts of town.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: So, I'm gonna put it over here.
Amanda: Ooh.
Eric: Oh, man, I bet 100 percent there's a shitty bar in there, huh?
Amanda: Incredible.
Julia: Oh, my god.
Eric: 100 percent.
Julia: I mean, like, there's gonna be a shitty bar in the district, the Shopping District II, I think.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Julia: But there's also definitely like a $1 mega lobe ultra-special out there.
Brandon: They're known for their – they only sell one drink. And it's a shareable drink. And it's an orb. And they have, like, a bunch of different multi hyper colored liquors that looks like a swirling bowling ball.
Amanda: Sure.
Julia: It’s very 80s. It’s gonna be 80s.
Brandon: And it’s called the Bowling Ball.
Amanda: I’m into it.
Eric: And then someone --
Brandon: And you only get three straws, because there’s only three holes in bowling.
Julia: That’s absolutely fair.
Eric: And then everyone else was like, “Can I just get a beer?” And they're like, “No.”
Julia: You can get your mega global drink in town.
Eric: If you wanna a highlife, get over there.
Brandon: It looks like I just drew like a spooky ghost with a shoe.
Eric: But that's fine. That's fair.
Brandon: I think I'm stealing this from an N64 game, but I'll just call that ash – like Astro Lane.
Eric: Astro Lane is good.
Amanda: Yay.
Brandon: I like that.
Eric: That’s good.
Brandon: They're always, like, weirdly sci-fi themed.
Amanda: Oh, no. My mechanical pencil that's so helpful for math making ran out of led. I need to go to the tool shop. Tool shed. That's what I want to say. I need to go to the tool shed. Excuse me.
Brandon: You over the tool shed. It’s just reams and reams of pencil led.
Eric: That makes sense.
Julia: Mhmm. Checks out.
Eric: It makes sense for me.
Midroll Music
Eric: Hey, it's Eric. Usually, we do something a little bit out of time, a little bit out of place here. But I think that it's just kind of nice if you just hear me talking about something that I like. And I'm just honest about it. I'm sure your couch is really nice. My couch is really nice. I have a blanket that I throw over myself when I'm at home. I'm spending time talking to my friends. We're all fully prepared on the internet to talk to each other by Skype, by Google Hangouts, by Zoom. I actually know how to use zoom, which is really fun. And, you know, it's, it's definitely scary outside. I'm not saying that it's not. And intentionally isolating yourself and knowing that it's a thing that you need to do to keep your community safe is difficult. But the thing about humans and what we learn from Dungeons and Dragons is that they're resourceful, and they're resilient, and they get great feats. So, I think that we're going to, ultimately, be okay, but the responsibilities that we just need to be nice to each other. And remember that it's not about whether or not you get sick. It's about whether or not the people around you do and you're being considerate to others. Ultimately, it's okay. Also, all of the TV show, Slings & Arrows, which is about Shakespeare and Ghosts is on YouTube. And there's a really young Rachel McAdams in it. So, you should just watch that.

Theme Music
Amanda: Okay. We're back.
Eric: All right. So, now, we're going to move to another phase in the town building. And we're going to name our resources. So, I'm gonna put a little table at the bottom. And one side is gonna be abundance, and the other side is scarcity. This is something that I took directly from A Quiet Year, which I really love. And the way to make a better idea of what the town is dealing with is you want to name the important resources for the community. And something might be in abundance. There might be a lot of it. Or something might be in scarcity. And there's not a lot of it. And we can come up with examples that are, like, services. Like, infrastructure. So, one example I have is transportation. We can have something that’s literal – a literal resource like fish. Or we can have something that's more of an idea or the way that people interact with each other or like sociological. Like openness. So, we're all gonna go around and choose a resource. And that makes it important if it wasn't already. So, If you pick gasoline, it’d become something that our community wants and needs even if it has – has it or doesn't have it. So, what I did and what we had talked about before is that I want to add science to the abundance list.
Amanda: Science.
Eric: And, just because I'm the DM, I'm just gonna drop it in there. But we're gonna choose which is an abundance or scarcity out of the ones that you guys come up with. So, I chose Science, because we talked about that there is a mad scientist or a reclusive inventor who lives in the area. So, I want to ask everyone where do you think their house is.
Brandon: They're not wealthy yet, right?
Eric: No, they are just mythical creature to the community at the moment.
Brandon: I, I think they might be, like, either a little far back into a forest or farther back on the hill. But, like – like, they were on the hill before they started building the fancy houses there or whatever.
Eric: Mhm.
Brandon: I think they'd be a little farther back.
Amanda: Like, kind of the back ridge or like top-left corner.
Brandon: Yeah, it doesn't have to be like Witch and Hansel and Gretel far back.
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: But, yeah. I feel like they would have built their home. And they would have been living there for a while before it started, like, really cropping up, because they were like – they built their house here because they wanted to get away from everyone.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: And then it started, like, popping off in terms of a really nice place to live.
Eric: I would like to put it in the bottom right.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I do like the idea of the – of that it was in the rich part, but I also kind of want it to be like farther away. Like, you gotta take a totally different road to get there.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah. And they got like an old dairy farm for cheap or something.
Eric: Oh, I love it like that. Yeah. That's the other thing. Is there anything interesting about their house? What makes it stand out?
Amanda: Mmm.
Julia: I like the idea of kind of, like, an old farmhouse that probably was bought for the cheap with the hope that someone would renovate it. And then it wasn't really renovated.
Brandon: It definitely has a barn where, like, that’s their workshop.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Like a – or like an old silo that doesn’t work anymore.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: I was just thinking silo.
Julia: Old silo.
Amanda: Yay.
Julia: There's that really specific one when you're driving in and out of Lake Placid.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: It's just like a big stone one that’s like half assembled.
Amanda: Yeah. Heck yeah.
Eric: All right. Wonderful. So, now --
Brandon: I forgot to give the silo a hat.
Julia: No.
Eric: Does a silo have a hat?
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Sometimes.
Julia: No, it’s broken down.
Amanda: Oh.
Brandon: Oh, okay. That's fair.
Eric: It has no hat. It is a broken – a broken silo.
Julia: A broken silo.
Amanda: No hat. Where’s its hat though?
Brandon: It blew off.
Amanda: Big silo, no hat?
Brandon: Big silo, no hat.
Eric: This, this game is fun. So, I want you all to name your resources. What do you think the town cares about?
Julia: Seafood. Obviously, like freshwater seafood.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: But specifically because I love flavor and, also, by flavor, I mean cuisine. Crayfish?
Amanda: Yay.
Eric: Yes.
Julia: Also known as crawdads. Also known as mountain lobsters.
Brandon: Are they different from crawfish?
Julia: So, it depends. There's different, like, names for it and different species. But this is like the subspecies. And I used to – when my family members lived up in kind of the Albany suburbs, every once in a while, we would go to a river. And my cousin and I would flip rocks and grab the little, like, crawdads. And --
Brandon: Hmmm. I love that.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: I didn't know we had this Upstate.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Do you just want to say like shellfish in general? So, like, have seafood and shellfish that are available in this area of the world.
Julia: Yes, I like that. I'm just thinking like what the town specialty will be like 30 years from now as well. And I want it to be mountain lobsters.
Eric: This is hilarious. Remember this for later.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: But, yeah, let's say – I want to say shellfish.
Julia: Got you.
Eric: And that's what we’re gonna call it
Julia: Perfect.
Amanda: I am going to say opportunity. And, in my mind, it is a scarcity. Like, having an economy that kind of caters to like a summer population, you're going – like, it's hard to take risks. And people expect things to be the way it was the summer before.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: So, if you want to start a new business, if you want to do something weird, if you don't want to run a coffee shop, we'll be like, “Where's the coffee shop?” And there's just, like, an expectation that things will always be the way they were, both for the people who, like, run the town and the businesses and also for those coming summer after summer.
Eric: Yeah, 100 percent.
Julia: Super like that as an abstract.
Amanda: Yeah. Maybe change is a better word. Like, it limits the amount of change that can happen in the town.
Eric: I like change.
Julia: Okay. Which is ironic given the point of this game, but I love it.
Eric: Change is interesting. I'll do opportunity/change. And we'll figure out how that shakes out.
Amanda: Okay.
Julia: Cool. Okay.
Brandon: I do want to do something about openness or welcomeness. It’s a resource right now. I think that the town right now is still small. It is still open and welcoming to outsiders, because they support their economy. And then I'm interested to see how that changes.
Eric: Cool. Is there a difference between welcomeness and openness? Or is there one that you're shooting for? Like, openness is like, “Yeah, come through to wherever you want.” But welcomeness is like, “You can come.”
Brandon: I think it's more of the welcomeness then.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: You're welcome in this way only.
Brandon: Yes.
Eric: Yes. I like welcomeness. I think that's very interesting.
Julia: It's super, like, Amity at the beginning of Jaws.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: Where they keep telling her – they’re like, “You'll never be an islander, but welcome.”
Brandon: Or like any southern town that exists.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: It’s interesting. I think it could be a character, like, telling them what we want as an abundance or scarcity.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: But it can be scarce in that you're welcome in only this way or it could be abundant --
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: -- and like anyone is welcome under these rules.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Well, let's make our choices.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: So, I think it's up to you three which would you like to be the abundance; shellfish, opportunity, or welcomeness.
Julia: Shellfish.
Brandon: Wait. You only have one abundance?
Eric: Mhmm. And the other two are gonna be scarce, because I chose – as the DM, I chose Science.
Brandon: Ooh. What if the other word is better most?
Amanda: Openness?
Brandon: Openness as a scarcity makes more sense?
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: I think that makes sense.
Amanda: I think so. Because it's like, “We are open in this limited way,” which is as many people can come spend dollars here.
Eric: Let me throw a wrench into this.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: What if we did welcomeness as an abundance? And then shellfish was scarce, but it is a delicacy.
Amanda: Okay.
Brandon: It makes sense. Yeah.
Eric: And then it – because I think what Brandon was trying to get out before is that whether or not they hold on to their welcomeness as things change.
Brandon: Yes.
Julia: Mhmm. Cool.
Eric: And that's the tension.
Amanda: I’m into that.
Eric: Okay.
Amanda: And what will happen to shellfish? More shellfish?
Julia: More shellfish.
Amanda: Less shellfish?
Julia: I mean --
Amanda: More shellfish though.
Julia: -- I could talk about this more as the town grows.
Amanda: Shellfish have hat? Shellfish have hat?
Julia: Shellfish. Wait. Hold on. How, how shellfish have hat?
Amanda: The shellfish, no hat?
Eric: Okay. So, now, everyone is going to take the one that they have. And they're going to put a feature on the map to demonstrate the fact that there is an abundance or scarcity of the thing that they suggested. So, Brandon, since you are abundance, I want you to go first.
Brandon: Okay.
Eric: How would you demonstrate that there is an abundance of welcomeness in this town?
Brandon: Hehe.
Julia: Mayhaps a Welcome Center.
Eric: Mayhap.
Amanda: Mayhap some welcome sign.
Brandon: Mayhaps a giant crawfish.
Julia: Yay.
Amanda: Yay.
Brandon: That waves its claw back and forth.
Amanda: Mountain lobster. Mountain lobster.
Julia: Good boy. Wait. I think we just came up with the hockey team name.
Amanda: The Mountain Lobsters.
Eric: The Mountain Lobster. All right. I'll put – I'll put that under my hat for later.
Julia: Thank you.
Amanda: Fuck. I want this merch so bad.
Julia: Mountain lobster. Mountain lobster.
Amanda: So good. Caving across the river from Main Street. Hello. I am lobster.
Brandon: It's mechanical. His, his claws just waves back and forth all day long.
Julia: Oh, he’s incredible.
Eric: What I – what I also like about this is that the bowling alley --
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: -- is outside of it.
Brandon: Yep.
Julia: He’s got to be neon too, right?
Eric: Or --
Julia: Like he’s outlined in neon.
Amanda: That’s like --
Brandon: No, I don’t – I don't think he's neon. I think he’s like olden and rusted.
Amanda: Weathered paint.
Julia: Oh, okay. Yeah.
Brandon: But he does have spotlights --
Eric: Of course.
Amanda: Uh huh. Uh huh.
Brandon: -- on the bottom. So, he's always lit.
Amanda: I love that.
Eric: And that's what welcomes you in the town?
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Wonderful.
Brandon: And there – there's like probably writing either on him or a sign that says like, “Welcome to blah, blah, blah. Population, four.”
Eric: Yeah, 100 percent.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: That's like, when people give directions, like, “Well, you go down to the river. And then you turn right at the lobster.”
Amanda: That’s very good.
Eric: And they’re like, “What?” And they’re like, “Exsqueeze me?”
Amanda: Exsqueeze me. Go to the left?
Brandon: You can't miss it. It's a giant lobster.
Eric: It's a – it’s a giant mountain lobster. It’s not a real lobster. It's a crayfish.
Julia: He is. He’s a crayfish.
Eric: Julia, you can decide whether or not you want that to stand for shellfish as well. But you do have the chance to put what a scarcity of shellfish looks like in the town.
Julia: I think that there has to be like one restaurant in town that serves that specialty, but no one else does.
Eric: 100 percent.
Julia: Okay. Cool.
Brandon: Because they've murdered everyone else who tried.
Julia: I'm just gonna do, like, a plate with a small lobster.
Eric: That's great. So, that one is gonna be our seafood house.
Julia: Yes. So, I put the Seafood House on the most right corner of the town.
Eric: The first thing people see when they come into town.
Julia: Pretty much. Yeah.
Eric: Very good. I like that.
Amanda: Cool. Cool.
Eric: And then, Amanda, how does a scarcity of opportunity look?
Brandon: Now, I do have a question. Did Seafood House original owners put up giant crayfish?
Julia: Ooh, I like. I like that as idea.
Eric: I think --
Amanda: That was so successful and iconic.
Eric: And I like that now, like, there's not enough shellfish to, like, sustain their business, but they have to stay.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: They have – they cannot change.
Amanda: Umm. I don't know. Maybe you guys can help me think of a way to draw this. My first thought was, like, maybe the high school has no career office. And, and that is what represents it, because it's kind of like, “Oh, well, you know you're gonna do because that’s a family thing.”
Julia: Underfunded high school?
Eric: Yeah, put in an underfunded high school. 100 percent.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: It could be a K through12 too.
Amanda: I think it should go in the upper right hand corner.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Because the bowling alley was probably built originally to, like, serve, you know, midtownies.
Julia: Just walk down hill to --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: -- to the bowling alley.
Amanda: Cool. So, I'll kind of center it in, like, the upper-right quadrant.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Great.
Brandon: Like it.
Julia: Amanda, did fantastic stairs on that. Look at that. So fancy.
Amanda: So, I made a long school with center doors, some stairs leading forward, and then a, a, like, track ring around the front yard.
Eric: I like that. I like that.
Brandon: How do you draw so many disaffected teenagers too? It’s amazing
Julia: Whoa.
Julia: They’re all like kind of smoking blunts, but you don't know.
Amanda: Yeah. Mhmm.
Eric: Now, is it – is it --
Brandon: So many jewels. What?
Eric: Is it a high school? Or --
Amanda: Not in the 80s.
Eric: No, it's tobacco and pipe. Is this K through 12 or is it a high school?
Julia: I think K through 12 makes the most sense given that it is a pretty small town.
Amanda: Yeah, I think it's same complex. We have a K to 6 building and then a high school building.
Eric: Great. Love that.
Amanda: Yeah. And it's possible that maybe another K to 6, like, somewhere else in a neighboring town feeds into this high school.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: That’s true.
Amanda: Which happens in a lot of places.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Oh, Julia and Amanda.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Would you like to name your buildings?
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: I do like Seafood House. Let’s just call it Seafood House.
Julia: Yeah. Or perhaps Crawfish House.
Eric: Chris Crawfish House. I do like that.
Julia: Oh, sorry. Crayfish House.
Eric: Crayfish House. We're gonna have to get the --
Julia: The terminology. Yeah.
Eric: Crawfish when in Louisiana, but crayfish Upstate.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah. But also, like, there's crawdads too and a bunch of other different names.
Oh, we can list out the names.
Brandon: I like Mountain Lobster.
Julia: Mountain Lobster is my favorite of the names.
Eric: We'll come to – we'll just call it Mountain Lobster House for now.
Julia: Got you.
Eric: And we'll come back to it if it pops off. Amanda, would you like to name your high – your K through 12?
Amanda: Yes, I think the K to 6 is John Brown Elementary School. And the high school is the North Country High School.
Julia: Ooh.
Amanda: Because that's what locals call the upper half of New York. It’s the North Country and John Brown, famous abolitionist, lived up there near Lake Placid.
Julia: Love it
Eric: All right. Let's pick the name of our town.
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: So, if you have something whole cloth, we will do it. But you must provide a town suffix at least. Like, Burg, Ville, Town, all that stuff. What I will pose – and this is only because I – this is what I've written down as a name saver and Amanda kept telling me that she liked it. I was just calling it Lake Town.
Julia: Yeah, sign me up for Lake Town.
Amanda: Lake Town. Lake Town. Lake Town. Lake Town.
Julia: Mostly because I am with Amanda, where I want it to turn to Lake Town City.
Eric: That’s true.
Brandon: That’s really funny.
Amanda: Lake Town City, baby. Lake Town Mountain Lobster.
Brandon: It sounds like the island Yu-Gi-Oh for a dueling tournament.
Julia: Yes, it’s correct.
Eric: I like that. Okay. This – I would – are we agreed on Lake Town?
Julia: Lake Town all the way, lady.
Amanda: Lake Town. Lake Town. Lake Town.
Eric: And then becoming Lake Town City?
Julia: Lake Town City.
Amanda: Lake Town. Lake Town. Lake Town.
Eric: All right. You guys take a nap. Brandon, what are you liking?
Brandon: It's not good, but I like it.
Eric: I agree. I 100 percent agree with that.
Brandon: That's true.
Julia: Lake Town City.
Eric: I do think it's LakeTownCity all in one word.
Julia: It’s so good.
Eric: Which I find very interesting.
Amanda: I thought it was just Laketown as one word.
Eric: Well, they could be, but then, when it comes to city --
Brandon: Laketown?
Eric: -- it's – yeah. It’s Laketown.
Amanda: People say, “Laketown, right?’ You’re like, “No, no, no. It's Lake Town.”
Julia: No, it’s Lake Town.
Brandon: Yeah. That’s really funny.
Eric: And then --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: It’s the opposite of what every other town does.
Eric: And then, as it expanded, it had to be Lake Town City and broken out.
Julia: Lake Town City.
Amanda: Maybe
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Okay.
Julia: Oh, I love it so much.
Brandon: I’ve heard your famous mountain lobsters in Laketown. No, no, no.
Julia: No, no, no. Lake Town.
Amanda: Lake Town.
Julia: You’re clearly not from around here.
Eric: All right. Now, we have our map for Lake Town? This is going to be Lake Town, 1985.
Brandon: Sent wave.
Eric: All right. Now that we've named this Lake Town and then the eventual Lake Town City, that concludes the town portion of the map game. Tune in next time where we talk about what makes the city a city.
Brandon: Map game.
Julia: Lake Town City.
Eric: Lake Town City. Follow your dreams.
Amanda: Lobsters. Yeah.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Yo, friends, welcome. I was trying something else. I don't – I guess won’t do it.
Brandon: I, I don't do well with change. Could you?
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Hey, hi. Hello. Welcome to the Pregame.
Eric: Hey.
Julia: Hey.
Brandon: Hey, hello.
Amanda: It's your friends at Joined the Party. And we're going to talk about who we're going to play in the next campaign and what class those people are going to be. Hello. That's what I got. I'm really excited about my character.
Eric: I am so ready for this. This is amazing. And we're going to do it. And the party is gonna happen. And it’s had – oh, this is my favorite part. I spend so much time looking at characters that can be played. And, like, if you guys don't do it, I just turn them into NPC. So, like, honestly, it's fine.
Amanda: Great.
Eric: I think there is someone who I don't think any of you touched. And I'm going to put it in the – I, I try to push it out to you all so hard. And this is my tease for the future. But, like, I don't think any of you are going to do it, but I'm definitely gonna make them an NPC if you don't.
Julia: Oh, now, I want to know which character it was.
Eric: I'll tell you.
Julia: Yes, tell me.
Eric: If one of you say it during this session --
Julia: Okay.
Eric: -- I will tell you. But, if you don't, I will bring it up later.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: So, today we're going to talk about what the characters are going to be. We’re gonna talk a lot of D&D mechanics, a lot of classes and subclasses. I'm going to talk about party composition and what might make the best Dungeon & Dragons Podcast party. And then, at the end, we are going to reaffirm everything about the future of the podcast and what the podcast is going to look like. Let's talk about party composition. We kind of just went into the first season being like, “Hey, what do you want to play?” I guess we should all figure out a way to do this. And, like, none of you had any healing spells.
Julia: That's – oh, my god. As, as a listener and as your friend, I was so nervous the entire campaign, because none of you could heal.
Eric: It all kind of, like, resolved itself, because, eventually, Johnny could heal in some sort of way or, at least, resurrect. And then TR8C and Anara eventually got like half damage things. Both of you got half damage things.
Brandon: I also had a healing spell eventually. It just didn't --
Eric: When you became an artificer. Yeah. So, I thought – I’m like, “Yeah, they're fine.” But I remember those first episodes, we got tweets. You’re like, “You guys are gonna die.” And I'm like, “I'm not gonna let them die. It's okay.”
Julia: I was very worried.
Eric: We just killed the god of death. It's fine.
Amanda: So --
Brandon: Spoilers!
Eric: This is March. This is March, Brandon.
Brandon: No, for me!
Eric: You killed – you killed the god of death. That was you. You were there.
Brandon: Okay.
Amanda: So, what is the traditional wisdom about how you put together a balanced D&D party? I've heard people say things like tank or, like, punchy person, like healer. What is the prevailing wisdom?
Julia: A punchy person is definitely the-- “Chaaa!”
Eric: Well pronounced?
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Preferred term.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: I also read this morning about a face. Is that something that you've ever heard of too, Eric?
Eric: Yes.
Brandon: Interesting.
Amanda: In scams, Brandon? My favorite subjects?
Julia: Well, The Face is a good guy in Wrestling.
Eric: Exactly. So, I'm going to talk about what the ideal five-person party is. The first is the tank. And the tank means you take a lot of damage. This is the Barbarian that literally has a feature that says I can take half damage. This might be the monk who has super high AC. They are going to be the ones in front of all the enemies. And the enemies are going to focus on them and will get resurrected and healed as necessary. The person who is next to the tank is the close damage person. So, this could be a fighter.
Amanda: Punchy friend.
Eric: The punchy friend.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: This is usually the fighter. It could also be a monk. A monk is very diverse. You should all be monks. I love monks so much. They're the ones who are doing sword or axe or punch damage. And it's important to have someone who's engaging with people right upfront. Then you have the AOE or area of effect or – what's the other term when you're doing --
Brandon: DPS.
Eric: DPS. Thank you. If you're playing an MMORPG, it's called DPS, damage per second. This is going to be the – your spell caster or your range person. So, maybe it's a wizard or a sorcerer or, like, a really, really specific type of ranger that does damage from afar but takes damage easily. Then you have your support, which is going to be your healer. So, your cleric, your Druid. Someone who's going to heal your party or buff them so that they will not get hurt as much. And then you have the wild card. So, the wild card is usually the Bard, who does other things that might not be – who might be like a Jack of all trades sort of thing or does non-combat important things. So, when you're talking about a face, a face is the person with the highest charisma --
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: -- who roles the persuasion checks and the intimidation checks and all that stuff. It's usually the Bard who is too busy like fucking everything to remember how to do spells.
Brandon: Gross.
Eric: Yeah, I hate bards.
Brandon: Bards suck.
Eric: Hate bards. Love monks. That's my DM-ing peeve.
Julia: Hmm.
Eric: So, that's a ideal five-person party. Four-person party, you can kind of drop the face or the wild card. Maybe that gets rolled into somebody else. You have a very charismatic fighter. So, maybe you might have, like, more of a knight character. Or maybe your cleric has a lot of persuasion. Or maybe you do have a rogue, who kind of does damage. And maybe you have that wild card and also they are responsible for all of the public interactions that you have. So, for a three-person party, I think that the tank or the punchy person are usually the same. You have one person who's upfront if you're fighting. You need a support person, which is our problem with the first season of Join the Party. You kind of need a cleric or a druid who can, like, buff other people. And then you might have a wild card. I wanted all of you to think about what sort of class archetype you are. And then maybe we can really make sure we distribute. So, we have a punchy person or a tank. And we have a damage dealer. And we have support. I think everyone should do one at a time – like each person does one and we’ll go around in a circle, because, really, this is like our ideation session.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: We're all bringing three classes and subclasses, which relate to a character they could be and how this might fit together as a party. But this is like our pool that everyone can pick from. It's like everyone who brought it has first dibs, but there should be a chance for everyone to start thinking about what's cool, game-wise. So, I think we should roll for it. This is our first roll of Season II.
Brandon: Okay. Let's see if my luck carries on.
Eric: Oh.
Amanda: Oh, no.
Julia: Are you kidding me?
Brandon: First roll, on the floor. Did you get that 20?
Amanda: I’m gonna – I’m gonna tell you what’s on the floor.
Brandon: That counts. That counts.
Amanda: Okay. So, Julia.
Julia: Huh.
Brandon: I got a five.
Julia: What did you get?
Brandon: I got a five.
Julia: I got a three. So --
Amanda: So, that means I get to choose what position I get, right?
Eric: That's true. I’m gonna get --
Amanda: I want to go last.
Eric: All right. Well, choose the order.
Amanda: Let's go Julia, Brandon, and me.
Eric: All right.
Julia: So, this is my tank and also my damage dealer, I suppose.
Eric: Your punchy friend.
Julia: My punchy friend. So, I went with a barbarian. Specifically, the Path of the Battlerager.
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Julia: Which is, I believe, Sword Coast.
Eric: Yes, it's from SCAG --
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: -- for every you – all of you playing at home.
Julia: So, my idea for the character, especially now that we've kind of established our city and our universe, is tiny baby punk rock with leather jacket covered in spikes, because it – typically, in D&D, the Path of the Battlerager always has spiked armor on.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: And they're the kind of character that just – they go into a rage. And then they throw themselves into the middle of the fight.
Amanda: Cool.
Julia: And no one wants to deal with the, the spiky small person getting in the middle of everything.
Amanda: Great.
Julia: And I really like the idea of – because we're talking about how our characters were affected because they were at this lake that’s like a timeshare or like a vacation house or something like that, I really want them to be like the child of a mob enforcer --
Amanda: Yes, Julia.
Julia: -- where the dad was down in the city dealing with other stuff. And, so, the mom and the kid went up for the vacation. So, the mom and the kid were affected --
Amanda: They’re good.
Julia: -- but not the dad.
Eric: Wow.
Julia: And, so, the parents, later on, separate because the mother decides to go up and, you know, live in the new city --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: -- with all the other powered people.
Eric: Right. Because she has to stay up there.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: If there is that quarantine, she has to stay there, but he can't leave.
Julia: Yes. And, so, they decided to stay with the mom and become townies in our city.
Eric: Here's a really interesting thing about this. It’s that, traditionally, the battle – and, in D&D lore, traditionally, they need to be dwarves only.
Julia: Which is why I want --
Eric: So, she’s --
Julia: -- them to be tiny.
Eric: And like – but, like, very Italian too.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: So, they’re --
Julia: Italian tiny person.
Eric: I love that. Just some cool features of this. So, the Battlerager armor does damage to people while you are making weapon attacks.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And you can use your armor as a weapon. So, that's really cool. And then you have something at level six, which is reckless abandon. So, when you use your reckless attack, which is what barbarians do, you get temporary hit points equal to your constitution modifier. You're going to be like a super stocky little friend. And then you're also gonna have extra hit points on top of that.
Julia: Yeah, I pictured them with brass knuckles going into fights.
Eric: Wooh!
Julia: And, also, if we're gonna give our characters superpowers if I'm comparing it to another superhero --
Eric: Mhmm.
Julia: I'm picturing Cannonball from the X-Men.
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: Where they just start kind of like vibrating and then everything just like zooms forward. And then they're in the middle of the fight doing their thing.
Eric: That is extremely good.
Julia: Thank you.
Amanda: I like that a lot.
Eric: Hey, Julia. I don't know if you listened to Join the Party before, but we did have a barbarian.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: But I think this is very different than TR8C --
Julia: Yes.
Eric: -- in so many ways. In my head, like TR8C was more of an artificer --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- because he had nerfed himself with his switch.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, it's like a reluctant barbarian is so different than like a willing barbarian. Totally different things. Also, like, using rage as a positive thing.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: It's like that's, like, some punk aesthetic. I love that.
Julia: Tiny baby anarchist.
Eric: It’s amazing. We're also going to come back to race --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- and how that is going to apply. But I’m going to talk about that after --
Julia: Sure.
Eric: -- class. So –
Amanda: After class.
Eric: I have – I have big thoughts. So, we'll come back to that.
Amanda: In the after-class party.
Eric: Office hours with DM Eric, I sit backwards on the chair. All right. Brandon, what’d you got?
Brandon: So, I sort of thought about what, like, sort of superhero archetype I wanted to embody and then what, what class would – might go along with that. So, a little bit in the reverse direction. But the first one I want to talk about, I think, is either like a DPS or a bit of a wild card. But this sort of idea of having someone who has, like, either multiple past lives or just multiple people in one person. So, something sort of like Legion on the one side or, on the other side, something more traditional like shapeshifter, whether it be like with animals or spirits or whatever it be. So, some of the ones I was looking at was the Circle of the Shepherd --
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: -- which is a druid. And then another one I was looking at is a monk. It's a Homebrew monk. It's called Way of the Shifting Form. It's sort of along the same lines.
Eric: Oh, that is interesting, because that's the one – and I'm not taking from D&D wiki, from all of you nerds out there. This is, like, vetted stuff from our Unearthed Arcana, which is this Subreddit that has a lot of this stuff. And I like that monk because it reminds me of you change into animals and, like, that's your fighting, which is very different in my head than wild shaping.
Julia: Beast Boy
Eric: Yeah, like Beast Boy. Thank you. Or, in the game, Sentinels of the Multiverse, there's, like, another --
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: -- person. And it's always like very African inspired, which is kind of bullshit. But, like, I think it is interesting that your power is fighting as animals.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Instead of changing into animals to – because of your connection to nature.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: That's cool.
Brandon: And then, on the other side of that – so, I love that idea of the animal changing. On the other side, it's more like there's a rogue archetype sort of this path as well. But, like, suddenly I realized that I've had past lives.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Brandon: And all of those past lives, people from my past lives might have some abilities or powers that I can start to channel.
Amanda: I read about that. I think they are really cool.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: Yeah. So, that could be like in the death space. Or it could also be just like on the Legion space, where it's multiple personalities, more than one person or whatever it is. But, yeah, I thought that was interesting.
Amanda: I think that could be really interesting in terms of, like, in geographically centered death-related power. People don't have to necessarily have died in the inciting incident.
Brandon: Right.
Amanda: But it could be something tied to, like, picking up stuff that otherwise wouldn't be discernible about people who have died in that area.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: That's interesting. We might, like, think about a grave domain cleric or something else. There's like a twilight domain as well. Like the edge between living and dead, that is also interesting. So, maybe there's an opportunity. We don't even know what class Brandon might end up going with. We’re throwing a bunch to the wall.
Brandon: Yeah. I think, within the character space, I think a lot of my ideas have a similar vein of, like, the character I think I want to portray as a person is sort of like they accept and like their powers, but it's not what they expected necessarily.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: So, it's like, on one side, it could be like, “Well, I can turn into a fox,” but like, “What good is that?”
Eric: Right.
Brandon: Or, on the other side, it's like I have people, in my head occasionally, that, like, tell me how to do a Math problem. And there's more that I can talk about. But, like, they're – they're great. And they like it. And they're trying to hone it and figure out what to do with it, but they don't know exactly why or what they can do with it.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: That reminds me of a meme that's been going around from the original X-Men movie. That Rogue is like, “Oh, well, maybe they can finally cure our powers.” And then Storm steps up and is like, “There's nothing wrong with us.” And then, below that, it's like, “Yeah, the woman who could make lightning talks to the woman who can't touch people.” So, I like that. That, like, even if it is a power and can be harnessed, like, it sucks for your day-to-day life.
Julia: Mhmm.
Brandon: Yeah. And I don't want it to make it like – I don't want it to suck from day-to-day life. I just want it to be like, well, I have this thing. I don't know. You have one really strong left arm. You're like, “Well, this is kind of cool. But, like, what do I do with it?”
Amanda: Right.
Julia: Yeah, turning into a fox is not gonna help you get a job.
Brandon: Yeah, exactly.
Amanda: Yeah. But, from a character journey perspective, I think that, like, sets you up for a lot of kind of room to grow and play.
Brandon: Yeah. Cool.
Eric: I'm gonna have to take a look at that homebrew again, but I really liked it. I remember sending that to you.
Brandon: I’ll sock it to you.
Amanda: Sock it to me.
Brandon: Sock it to me. All right. Amanda, what have you got?
Amanda: So, I approach this from Somalia; like a character personality perspective. And I really just want to play the opposite of Anara, not because I don't love her but because I want to challenge myself and do something different in this campaign. So, for me, that means, like, very inextricably tied emotionally but also geographically to the location. So, I wanted to have someone who, like, knows a trade, who, like, knows the city very well. And I don't know if we're going to end up adventuring outside of the city, but that's where I wanted to start. And, also, we have been developing and just like thinking on these ideas as we've been finishing the office. And I realized that, like, I'm inextricable from my, like, Irish bricklaying roots. So, I really want to play like the super of a building and someone who just, like, knows that particular building, the tools. Like a kind of multi-skilled person who's, like, weapons and skills are, like, handyman-isms and repairs. So, in terms of trying to find a class to suit that, I think there is a version where you can deal damage with this stuff, but also more of a kind of healing and support role, both for the party and also for like, you know, the problems that we run into, like, around us. So, what I think could be really interesting is – I don’t know who I’ll start with. Ugh, I have so many.
Eric: Just in terms of how – what we talked about in the previous episode. Like you can be the custodian or the groundskeeper of the historic district.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: Like, it can't be that much. Like, how many buildings is it? If we're talking about the super of New York City apartment, that's like – let's say 20 apartments. I can't imagine there's more than like 20 or 30 houses in the historic district.
Amanda: Yeah. So, I think there's a version where it's like, you know, groundskeeper for the area. I think there's also a version where it's more kind of like diplomatic. Like, maybe it's a Community Association President --
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: -- or something or a leader.
Eric: Totally be both by the way. Like --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- both of those do not feel like full-time jobs.
Amanda: No, it definitely could be. And then I think there's also something where it's more like a self-appointed kind of like historian or chronicler or like carrying forward of, like, this community, this incident that people who have died, like, just feeling as if you have to kind of be responsible for them and carry their will forward.
Eric: I will say I like that it's real, because if we – everything we talked about that this is a government act from the state or the country, like, making this historical district. There will be a job there.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yes.
Eric: So, you can be a public servant.
Amanda: Yeah. So, let's start with that then. I think, Mr. Monk, that it could be interesting to have a, a tranquility monk.
Eric: Uh-huh.
Julia: Mmmm.
Amanda: So, this is a monk that kind of – it's from UA – prizes, nonviolence as like the primary decision making and like conflict solving method. And, like, violence is the absolute last resort. So, you use diplomacy, mercy, and understanding to resolve conflicts, but you're also – if necessary, you can put violence to use in order to solve injustice.
Eric: Interesting. This is also a support because there's healing hands. So, it's like you have the Paladin stuff, where you can lay on hands. But you use it with a key.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Eric: I really like the fact that you can just do, like, pacifism.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Like, you need to just make people stop fighting.
Amanda: Like, at the sixth level, you have an emissary of peace, which you make a charisma check to calm violent emotions or to counsel peace.
Julia: That’s very good.
Amanda: So, I think it will be a very interesting foil to Julia's character.
Julia: If that’s the one I go for.
Eric: Yeah. And then you can cast sanctuary at will.
Amanda: Yes.
Julia: Wow.
Eric: Which is – which is like – so, you're a support monk, which is very interesting in terms of support, because, like, if someone runs up behind you, you can literally just punch him in the face.
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: What if a good politician?
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Like city councilman.
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: Or state council person.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Julia: I like that this is Paladin monk. That's a really cool combo.
Amanda: Yeah, I didn't really want to lean all the way into, like, channeling divinity.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: But I do think that a character has a really strong grasp – beginning anti-Anara of right and wrong – of not just like let me be, you know, neutral in terms of the law. Like, someone who feels strongly that they have to uphold something, whether that's like the physical safety of a community or the kind of, like, safeguarding of, like, tradition or of morals.
Eric: This is so interesting, because like monks also – for those of you who haven't really played, you can use key points to do, like, superhuman feats. It’s like I'm imagining you're --
Amanda: I’m channeling civics to, like, do something.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: But it's like you jump 20 feet in the air and then you make someone else stop fighting. Like, that's insane.
Brandon: I mean, if I saw that I would stop fighting, too.
Eric: Right. Well, like, I think that is like truly the superhumanity that we're talking about.
Amanda: Yeah. Yeah.
Eric: That's wild.
Amanda: From a personal perspective, like, I thought I was gonna go into politics for a long time. Like, I'm, you know, oldest of four kids and then a kind of peacekeeper role legislating multitude in life. And I think it'd be interesting to kind of explore that in a slightly less high stakes way in D&D.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: This is like what Jessica Jones is if she, like, wasn't a misanthrope, right?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Like, she's just, like, super-powered. Like, she's super strong and very athletic. But then, on the other hand, she's also a PI. And, like, you, on the other hand, you’re just like – you are a legislator.
Amanda: And I think Luke Cage, in a way, too where there is, like, being available for your community perspective and then, like, superhuman abilities to back that up. Or loose character from Unsleeping City --
Eric: Mhmm.
Amanda: -- where you are like a representative in Dimension 20 of the will and needs of a community. And you kind of like channel that responsibility to do things that others can't do.
Eric: Kingston Brown is a cleric of the city domain. So, he literally gets his powers from the city.
Amanda: So, that's my idea.
Eric: Cool. Let's do it again. I'm so hype.
Julia: I guess kind of going off of yours, Amanda --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: -- I'll talk about what my support character kind of looks like.
Amanda: Great.
Julia: And I was very concerned as you started talking about your character because very much the way that I built around my support character is very similar in that they are very involved into the community and all that kind of thing. Like, I picture them being the kind of person who, one, they work in IT.
Amanda: Yay.
Julia: And, so, they help all of the little old ladies in their building kind of figure out like, “Okay. Oh, your grandson set up your, your WiFi password, and you don't know what the password is. Don’t worry. I'll figure it out for you.”
Amanda: Oh, cute.
Julia: That kind of thing.
Eric: Oh, 69 --
Brandon: And they type in password.
Eric: It’s 402069. Oh, of course, it is.
Amanda: How the hell do I remember those numbers? Don’t worry about it.
Julia: You know what, Mrs. Ramirez? Not a problem. Don't worry about it. I changed it to your grandson loves you. Yeah. I think, in order to kind of fit that – I was looking at the city domain since we mentioned it a little. I like it, but I am not in love with it. And one of the ones that Eric suggested was the forge domain, which is typically like blacksmith characters if we're talking about fantasy D&D. But I think --
Amanda: Oh, but not in City of the Future.
Julia: No. In the City of the Future, I'm thinking IT tech, like, out there, like, creating gadgets and, like --
Brandon: LOL, that’s so funny.
Julia: -- shields and stuff like that for people.
Amanda: Cool.
Julia: Because, you know, things get messy when people have superpowers. And they're there to kind of help people along. I also really liked the idea of them being either like first or second-generation American. Again, going Italian because that's my background. But, like, you know, talking to all the little babies and making sure everyone's doing okay --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: -- and getting traded lasagna for IT tech information and stuff like that.
Eric: That's a good deal.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: That’s a good deal.
Julia: Password, love some lasagna.
Brandon: Oh, for lasagna.
Eric: I love that because that's just like technomancy.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Because that's the superpower.
Amanda: Brandon, my password is lasagna. You can't just say that.
Brandon: Oh, no. I ate your password, Amanda.
Amanda: Waaa.
Eric: Your password is a literal piece of lasagna.
Amanda: You don't use a wet noodle for Touch ID? Is that not?
Eric: Oh, my god.
Amanda: No?
Julia: But, yeah, kind of talking a little bit more about the inspiration for the character, I was thinking very much of Forge from X-Men, who, in the comics, is – and like it's a little problematic the way they wrote it. It’s like a Cherokee shaman who gives up his shaman practices and goes and, like, is drafted into the Vietnam War, I think or some sort of war. I don't remember which.
Amanda: God, what a revisionist history narrative.
Julia: And then discovers that his mutant power is, basically, he's able to create any technology he can think of. Like, kind of combining those two things while using the, the forge domain, I think would be --
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: -- an interesting --
Brandon: That’s very cool.
Julia: -- interesting play on it.
Eric: This is interesting. The channel divinity for the forge domain is artisan blessing.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, you literally can just make simple items.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And we can talk about what a simple piece of technology is.
Julia: Right.
Eric: The other thing is the soul of the forge you get because of your mastery of the forge. You get resistance to fire damage.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And then you get an extra bonus AC. We can also change that. Like, we can make techno damage if we make that too into a thing.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: So, that would be very cool.
Julia: I think that'd be fun.
Eric: Hell yeah.
Brandon: So, I will also talk about my support-ish character, I think. So, again, sort of my overall archetype here, I'm going to call it like sort of, like, the charmer. And I like this idea of sort of playing off the Purple Man, but like not bad.
Amanda: What’s a Purple Man?
Brandon: So, in Marvel and Jessica Jones --
Julia: David Tennant's character.
Brandon: David Tennant’s character.
Amanda: Oh, yeah.
Brandon: Yeah. He sort of, like, is able to convince people to do what he wants. I was thinking though more of like – because I, I do think I want to play like a lawful good character. And they're trying to do good in the community, especially in the community that they inhabit or they grew up in or whatever it is. Maybe this person – it could be a politician, but I like your politician better, Amanda. So, I think what could – they could be is they could be a literal therapist. They could be a psychic. But the framing of that, both of them, they, they are trying to do genuine good for people. So, the class I was looking at is, like, there's a school of enchantment as a wizard. There's the fear whisperer as a bard. So, like, the therapist could hear their fears.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Onomancy, which is another wizard, they're kind of like a secret finder. So, they, they know your “true name.” So you can sort of like be someone that they open up to. But the sort of – yeah, this person that people feel – don't know exactly why. But they feel like they can open up to. And then, in general, this person tries to help them by, like, saying – charming them to be like, “Oh, you should stop smoking.” But, obviously, we know that is sort of morally gray.
Julia: I think you could also kind of play with the idea of you can't convince anyone of anything they don't actually want to do, like, in their hearts.
Amanda: True.
Brandon: Yeah. Yeah. That's good.
Julia: Just some people get in their own head and can't convince themselves to do the thing that's best for them.
Brandon: Yeah. Well, I also think that, like, the characters alignment and personality would be, like, even if that's not true, they could be like, “Yeah, I don't do anything that people don't want.”
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: They tell me they want. It's just like habits are hard to break. So, I help them with their habit.
Amanda: Mhmm.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I'm trying to think of the other time that I've seen this, because, like, Purple Man is a bad person and the embodiment of toxic masculinity. I think the other one was in the Umbrella Academy. There was the woman who could, like, suggest things to people, and then they would do it for her.
Julia: Oh, Whisperer, I think, is the code name.
Eric: Yeah. And then it made her into a movie star. So, like, I can see all the times when people abuse it. So, I think doing it in a different way.
Amanda: Yeah, but putting it to useful good. Really interesting.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: I can see, like, a role where this is like elder care as well.
Brandon: Oh, that's great. Yeah, I like that.
Amanda: Kind of stuff. Like, being a kind of like – you know, just confidant and person that someone listens to.
Brandon: Yeah, that's really cool. I like that too. Yeah, definitely, like the fear whisperer, but I don't know if I want to play a bard. But the fear whisperer works really nicely with that.
Eric: I’ll allow it. Maybe. I'll think about it.
Amanda: So, my – I think this would actually be my either tank or punchy person. So, the only thing that I don't know how to do, home repair wise, is plumbing. I just have no idea. So, I think I would want to play a plumber. That'd be pretty fun because I think that the idea of a swarm keeper ranger is really fascinating. So, a swarm keeper, you know, you can summon like rats or bees or someone to basically like – it's like a mage hand, but instead it's like a swarm of animals that, like – can come to your aid. But, in this case, I think mine would be water. And, so, it's, again, sort of like hacking a ranger to be a little bit more like a druid. And there's a world I think where this is an actual druid, but, especially if it's a city where we're like connected to like canals and riverways, if the Kind of inciting incident has something to do with water, I can see a world where my power is being like very connected to that. And, so, if we’re, like, exploring the city, there are like bricks over rivers everywhere. Maybe there's some kind of connection to that. Maybe it's like, you know, you can summon water. And that's kind of your main way of, like, damaging others. And I think it could be neat if my cover story is like being a plumber or like an infrastructural engineer. And, and that's just like the thing that I have domain over.
Brandon: Oops, the pipe broke.
Amanda: Uh-uh.
Eric: Just so everyone knows, the swarm keeper is also in Unearthed Arcana. And the Ranger, we can just talk about this right now. Traditionally, the ranger does not make sense for D&D campaigns, especially on a microphone.
Brandon: Mhmm.
Eric: The Ranger was created for, like, an older style of D&D where it's like you have different terrain. And you need to hunt for your food. And, like, you need to navigate and all that stuff. But, in a different part of UA, they have had like updated versions of the ranger.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: An updated version of the ranger has been released in one of the other books. I can't remember which one. So, like, having a viable ranger would be very interesting.
Amanda: I mean it's very physical.
Eric: Exactly.
Amanda: Like, I get how it's a ranger.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: And I think a druid version of this could be like the Circle of Land, which is all about keeping balance. And, so, it would be like this is how – like, protecting the environment. Like, this is how it's supposed to be. And, if new building projects are threatening that balance somehow, it's all about kind of like keeping what is. But I also don't want to commit totally to, like, a character that is only defending stasis. I think we could kind of chart a middle course.
Eric: I am 100 percent onboard with water being your swarm. The only thing left to talk about is like, if you wanted to fly. But, like, we can – we can definitely do this. The level three feature is called gathered swarm.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And you just get a swarm of your spirits. They're just, like, tiny. So, they're like bugs or their little rats. So, like --
Amanda: Like, just, just a little globule of water. Bye, friend. And then you just set it --
Eric: It’s just like a river. Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: I love that.
Brandon: You could be a surfing Pikachu.
Amanda: That's true. I am from the sandy crumbling shores of Long Island. And it's in me.
Brandon: This is unrelated. But I was reading that, one, because it was really cool. And I did think that it'd be really fun to play a vampire in some campaign where you have a swarm of bats around you.
Julia: I think – apparently, we're all way too similar, because that was one of my ones that didn't make it. Except, I was gonna use it as like – you know how with a traditional ranger, you know, you're calling it like – I don't know – cool animals.
Eric: Like --
Julia: But you live in a city. So, all you got are like rats and cockroaches.
Amanda: Bees.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah, gross.
Eric: That's what they did with the Circle of Shepherd in Dimension. 20.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Brian Murphy, he was a Circle of Shepherds. And he conjured like cockroaches, and rats, and disgusting shit. And he was also a rat-man. So, it was beautiful. He lived in the sewer.
Julia: I will say I wrote that down. And then I watched Unsleeping city. And I was like, “Uh, nope.” Brian Murphy stole my idea.
Amanda: I also did think about a swarm of bees.
Julia: Obviously.
Amanda: And, A, I could talk about bees a lot, which I really enjoy.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Bee. It's all about bees. It's all about, like, maintaining, you know, environmental balance --
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: -- and like native pollinators and stuff.
Brandon: You could be an urban beekeeper on the rooftop.
Eric: If you don’t want to do water, you could definitely do bees. I’d let you do bees.
Amanda: Aww. Bees would be very good. And I think I could – yeah. Then maybe it's – you know, maybe my role is like a farmer, groundskeeper of the land. And my bees can attack them.
Eric: That sounds great.
Brandon: No one ever expects bees.
Amanda: Bees.
Eric: Bees?
Brandon: A box of bees.
Eric: I like to know that you know every bee's name. That's so much – that one jarred me.
Amanda: Galadriel, go.
Eric: Just one bee.
Julia: Amanda, do you have popcorn?
Amanda: I do. I have cheddar, caramel, and regular, and a bowl with a divider. So, you have three little pockets.
Julia: Oh, my gosh. You and the dividers. I love it.
Amanda: All right. Let me – let me get it. One second. One second.

Theme Music
Amanda: Don't worry. I'm back. Here's the popcorn.
Julia: Oh, it's steaming hot.
Amanda: Yay.
Eric: Oh, no, I ate all of it.
Brandon: Oh, no, the carb was way too high.
Eric: Aaah! I can't speak. Good thing I got my extra mouth from my car, and, now, we can continue.
Julia: Yay.
Eric: All right. Let's do our last round because I need more. I need more in my life.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Um, um, um, um, um.
Julia: So, this one I wrote kind of before we came up with the world idea. And I'm not entirely sure it’s going to work in, like, the relationship that we established between our characters. But I really liked this idea. And I, I – again, this harkens back to my love of the X-Men, but, like, someone whose powers, you know, like, overtake them. And, so, they don't like – basically, so, my idea is the character themselves is not the one with powers, but rather, like, one of their loved ones got their powers. But then the powers meant they were confined to a thing, in this case, a computer or a smartphone.
Amanda: Hmmm.
Eric: Hmmm.
Julia: Instead of like this character being the one that has the traditional powers in a sense, they gain their powers from utilizing their loved one's ability to control computers and, you know, electric stuff and whatnot. Kind of like Joaquin Phoenix’s Her meets Full Metal Alchemist --
Amanda: Hmmm.
Julia: -- in a lot of ways.
Amanda: Or like a staff. Like, channeling power through a staff.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: I do think this still fits.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Because this could be like, again, my Hero Academia, where, like, just because there is a tradition of people who get powers, you could also not have powers.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: And, now, your parents made you a thing to cover it up.
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Which could be tight as fuck.
Amanda: That’s really interesting.
Julia: Yeah. I really like that. So, the class and the subclass that I picked for this one is Warlock, but it's Ghosts in the Machine patron.
Eric: Oh, yeah.
Amanda: Cool.
Eric: Where's the Ghost of the Machine from?
Julia: It’s Unearthed Arcana, the Modern Magic section.
Eric: Oh, fuck.
Julia: It’s the same place as the city domain.
Eric: Goddamn.
Julia: And technomancy.
Amanda: That's very cool.
Eric: Go.
Julia: And that would be probably like damage dealer, because Warlock is usually, like, long-distance damage rather than getting into the fray damage.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Damn. I gotta look this thing up. I remember I spent so much time staring at the Modern Magic stuff. Modern Magic is also interesting. And there's an expanded spell list --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- of hacking. And --
Julia: On/off is a really cool one.
Eric: Where you can just like turn --
Julia: And infallible relay is fun too.
Eric: On/off is wild.
Julia: I can call anyone as long as they're on the same plane as – of existences as me.
Amanda: That's extremely cool.
Julia: And once I, like, know them. Yeah.
Amanda: I like that.
Eric: Let's see.
Julia: Like cool scrying.
Eric: This is really interesting the way that they talk about modern magic because it's like about information --
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: -- and the way that, like, the internet is a hub of information.
Julia: Right.
Eric: So, you have, like, information surge, which, like, tells you about stuff. Wire Walk is also cool because you can --
Julia: Yes.
Eric: That's where you can travel short distances through wires.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, that would be wild.
Julia: That would be very cool.
Eric: So, that's another, like, type of technomancy. Also, again, very different from Warlock than Johnny was, because your patron isn't a god.
Julia: No.
Eric: It's a thing that you need to care for.
Julia: Oh, I --
Eric: Oh, I need you to – you're gonna have to draw to drop your phone.
Amanda: I --
Brandon: Hell fucking yeah.
Julia: So, the way that I was picturing I it --
Amanda: I get a pop socket. All advantages.
Julia: The way that I was picturing it is I really want the patron and the character to have, like, a relationship.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: In the sense that, like – I don't know. Maybe they started dating in college or something. And the character didn't know that their partner had powers --
Amanda: This whole thing. Yeah.
Julia: -- until their powers, like, overtook them. And, now, they're stuck in this iPhone or whatever.
Amanda: Oh, man. I love this.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Can it be like an iPhone 3?
Julia: Eventually, they have to transfer over into an iWatch, Apple Watch.
Amanda: I love this one, Julia. But I really like this idea of being like the custodian of the source of your power --
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: And of having a relationship, which feels like it's a four-person party, you know.
Julia: Yeah. I, I do like it. I like the idea of it being a romantic relationship. I can be convinced otherwise, but that was my instinct going into it.
Amanda: Yeah, I like that.
Julia: Because, you know, do you stay with your loved one when they're only a iPhone now?
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: It's really interesting that the warlock invocation is just like the things you can do.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: Like, yeah, I can read everything. It's because my iPhone can translate everything.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: And that's very cool.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: That's – that's interesting.
Amanda: Deception everywhere.
Brandon: The translations are very poor though.
Eric: Yeah, it's – it's just Google translate. It's very funny.
Brandon: So, my last one is more of a straightforward tank, not super creative, but sort of two different paths I can go down here. Again, there's like sort of the, the Wolverine Way, which is the – it's a monk. And it's the Way of the Kensei. And that's when you basically, like, have complete mastery over a weapon. But I was thinking we could reskin it to be like something like Wolverine, where your weapons are internal or whatever it is.
Eric: For sure.
Brandon: And then the other side of it is also a monk, but it's the Way of the Astral Self. And I, I wrote it like the Astral Hulk.
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: It’s like – I like that you sort of, like, gain pieces of yourself over time. So, it's like, “Oh, I have a – like an astral left arm that's really strong.” And then, eventually, you sort of, like, transform into the – something astral or you can make it like Johnny Storm or The Thing, where it's like pieces of you are transforming over time. And it's like, “My left arm is now like diamond skin or my – and then, like, it grows over time.”
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: I like that. I think that the imagery of the Astral Self is interesting. But turning that into any power is just fucking cool. That, like, you just have one really jacked arm. That's – uh, I just love that idea, because we haven't talked about this. And we'll get into this a little bit when we talk about race. It’s like what do you look like when you get your power? Lots of people look the same, but you could turn into The Thing.
Amanda: My farmer can always have just one bee around in the same room.
Eric: You keep your be in a pocket.
Julia: Oh, no.
Amanda: I want a little bee in a pocket.
Eric: Little bee in pocket!
Amanda: My final one was kind of the first one I came up with. A lot more straightforward. This would be just like a really well-rounded fighter. And this would be like a true, like, super or like caretaker. Like very well rounded. You have proficiency with a lot of different tools. I didn't find a subclass that I really loved. But I thought that I would ask everyone if you have a particular one that you like. But this would be more like – yeah, like, ambient awareness of problems. Like, you can assess a physical problem and, you know, fix it really quickly. But you can, obviously, also – like, I like the idea being kind of a, like, support or, like, a range fighter, where I could, like, you know, cut down one of the ropes holding that, like, tent up and, like, collapse it. Some kind of like environmental or structural based proficiency and damage.
Eric: Yeah, you – I mean, honestly, like, fighter is very diverse for a reason because you can choose things that you're good at. Like, you have battle maneuvers if you want to be a Battle Master, which is just the regular ones. There's a sharpshooter in UA that you could choose to be if you wanted to be range. Like, you can totally specialize in range stuff.
Julia: Be a cowboy. Be a cowboy.
Brandon: Cowboy. Cowboy. Cowboy.
Amanda: It's true.
Eric: I mean, listen, Green Arrow exists and so does Hawkeye.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: And there are better versions of them than the ones that are on our television and movie screens.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, like a range person who's very cool and stuff, that would be more of like the damage dealer. But I think that like, if you wanted to target – like, I have ACs for everything on my DM screen.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So, like if you wanted to target stuff and then have that damage that you can just like say, like, “That's my battle style.” And I will make sure to prepare that. The other thing – and I know we were looking at this before, but like the rune keeper fighter --
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: -- which like you, you put, like, buffs literally on yourself.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Tattoos.
Eric: Yeah. Or just like Shulk in Super Smash Bros.
Amanda: Or you can, like, engrave your tools with different kinds of runes. And I, I think that would probably be the subclass that makes the most sense to really, like, imbue your tools with, like, special powers and to have a set of tools that you, you know – and I'm using that as in like, like the small – the small t-tools. Like, use hand tools as my weapons. Like, I always have my kit with, like, my multi-tool and my, you know, hammer --
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: -- and my screwdriver with me, which you can, like, stab into someone if you really wanted to. But, just thinking of like, yeah, those kinds of creative attacks and using the kind of rune keeper to channel like particular proficiency with those things.
Eric: The other thing about the rune keeper is that it's supposed to be like giant language. But, similar to the way that Julia was, like, you could just be Irish. You could just be gay. Like --
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Which is very funny to me.
Amanda: Yeah. Or stones and maybe it is the kind of bricklayer flavor of that.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: But it would be – it would be fun for me. And I know it sounds the least baked of all of my – but this was kind of my original idea of you're around to like take care of everybody's issues. And then you don't necessarily want to turn those into violence, but preventative violence means that you prevent problems. Like, that is a very driving force, I think, for this person.
Eric: I think that the fighter also gives you stuff in that just the class itself to buff your damage because it is a damage dealer.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: But we can also talk about your feats. So, let's talk about race. The majority of you are probably going to be humans. And I think, if you want to be a human, you should be a variant human. So, the difference between a human and a variant human when you're making your character is that the human traditionally just has plus one to all six of the stats. But, if you want to be a very human, you get plus one to two stats and you get a feat. And a feat is just like, “I'm good at this one thing. And I got a buff to my character very specifically.” If you remember from the last campaign, this was Mike's monk. I just like gave him the shit-talking feat. And, like, that's the thing that he's good at. So, you could totally have like a sharpshooter feat. You could have like – I don't know – any sort of damage dealing. And we can really look through that in the player – in the player handbook and beyond. The other thing about race is – and this is related to the conversation we were having about the astral monk – is that like, if your power changed you into looking like something else, let's re-skin a different race. Like, that would make you into like a hat. We could give you half orc stats, Brandon. And then go from there. Or, like, if you are someone – maybe, if we make this more watery – we don't have to. But, if you wanted to, you have gills and, like, you’re a merfolk. And we reskin that. So, it's like you are a monstrous version of humanity. And then you deal with that visually if that's something you want to entertain in your character.
Julia: Mhmm.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So, I'm very excited about that, both from the feats perspective and like looking different and how your powers affect how you look. Cool. You guys have cool ideas.
Julia: I’m so excited.
Eric: Now, I want to talk about the podcast itself. This is still Join the Party. Hello. Welcome.
Amanda: Hi. It’s a podcast.
Brandon: Hello.
Eric: Hey, hi. Hello. Welcome to the podcast.
Amanda: It is important to us that we stay biweekly/fortnightly. What up, Brits? So, we are going to be releasing episodes every other week. And then we also love the Afterparty. We want to do it. But, in the previous campaign, what we would do is play D&D for like a couple of hours. And then, you know, take a break to use bathroom and get water, and then come back and record the Afterparty. And it ended up feeling not like an exciting thing that we wanted to, like, come to the table, talk about what's happening, like, check-in with all of you. But it felt like, “Oh, no, I have to do this before I go home.” And we didn't want to, like, bring that energy to you all. And we know that you all don't want us to feel as if this is, you know, a slog and not like a delightful thing. So, for that reason, we are going to record after parties every two episodes. So, it's like, you know, Episode, two weeks, episode and then, a week after that, Afterparty. So, it will be --
Eric: They’ll be off week.
Amanda: Exactly. In the off week, every other episode. So, roughly once a month after parties and two to three times a month episodes.
Eric: The other thing that I'm truly excited about that we learn from doing the Afterparty At the End of the World and the Afterparty After the End of the World is, like, we want your questions. Like, we want everyone to be caught up and then listen to the Afterparty. We record these game’s episodes a while in the future. And, like, we want to come back to them and think about the things that we now noticed. And we want you to notice it too. The Afterparty episodes are also going to be, like, feel, like, full episodes. It's not just a bonus that we're attaching to regular campaign episodes.
Amanda: So, it'll be – yeah – like, more than 30 minutes long, because we want to make sure that, again, we're not just kind of like on our own doing a quota and, like, me asking, you know, Eric, and my fellow players questions about how the episode when. But we want to be sure that we record them after you've had a chance to listen to the episode. And we can talk, not just about your episode reactions and questions and our kind of, like, behind-the-scenes process, but also like what's happening in D&D. Like, we never got to talk on the show about all of these interesting Xanathars and UA and, like, all these other things that are coming out in the D&D world or, like, RPGs that we're really enjoying. So, we want to make sure that we save some time and we can be kind of more contemporaneous than after parties have been in the past. So, if there's stuff that you would really love to see us talk about as like a segment or on a recurring basis, we’re open to hearing your thoughts. But we definitely want to make sure these after parties are, like, part, you know, D&D chat show and part Afterparty as you know and love.
Eric: Also, it helps that we just chose like 75 percent Unearthed Arcana. We just totally gonna change. It seems like D&D is gonna release a new book any day now.
Julia: Mhmm.
Eric: So, who knows if that's gonna affect our characters and as we like rework them to fit the definitive versions that are gonna be in the new books. Also, we have three players again.
Julia: Yay.
Brandon: Yay.
Amanda: Yay.
Eric: That's our biggest change. I don't know if you noticed, but Julia is here.
Julia: It’s me.
Amanda: Yay.
Brandon: I'm excited.
Eric: I'm excited.
Brandon: I want to make character Eric.
Eric: I have to do research into, like, hockey, and like waterways, and like how cities grow. I am excited. I don't know if we're going to do this at another pregame episode. But, like, I would love to try to build the city out with all of you.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Like, maybe we can play A Quiet Year or like use parts of A Quiet Year to --
Amanda: Let’s do it.
Eric: -- fill out the map a little bit.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: But like I love cities that have very defined neighborhoods. Like, some parts of New York City does this. I know Pittsburgh does this a lot. Portland does a lot like this too. Very – make sure every place in the city is different and definably so, both your architecture and like vibe and what they have. And I'm very excited about all of that.
Amanda: Yeah. Can we have the Gulch?
Eric: Yeah, we'll put in the Gulch. The place where the – where the highway used to be and, now, it's high-speed trains. It's the reverse Gulch.
Brandon: Love it. Fish market, I want a fish market.
Julia: There’s gotta be a fish market.
Eric: We can – if there's water, we'll do it. I need to like – I'm gonna make the rough map. And I think we'll fill it in.
Julia: Okay.
Eric: But I would love to play that in the coming weeks.
Julia: I can't wait to find out what the, like, well-known food is.
Brandon: Oh, yeah.
Julia: Like, it's not pizza and bagels. What is it?
Eric: I don't – that's great. I will --
Brandon: It’s pizza bagels.
Amanda: Poutine Ice Cream Sundae.
Brandon: Ooh.
Eric: There’s not gonna be a lot of Canadian influence up there.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Absolutely. Oh, I'm so excited.
Julia: Elk burgers.
Amanda: What are --
Eric: Maybe. Like, it's a Juicy Lucy, but it's with elk.
Julia: Mhmm. Oooh.
Amanda: Eww.
Julia: Ooh, yummy.
Eric: That'd be cool.
Amanda: I don't like that word.
Eric: It's the --
Amanda: No, I know. I just don't like it.
Eric: No, I don't like it either.
Amanda: What are – what are the Tim Hortons munchkins called? Like --
Eric: Timbits.
Amanda: -- Timbly Tomblies?
Julia: Timbits.
Eric: Timbits.
Brandon: Timbly Tomblies.
Eric: Oh, my god.
Julia: Timbly Tomblies, that’s what they call it now.
Brandon: Yep, that’s what it is.
Eric: Yeah, they’re Timbly Tomblies. Yeah.
Julia: Okay.
Amanda: Well, anyway, I think a bunch of those in a waffle cone could be cool.
Eric: Oh, shit.
Amanda: That’s – that’s just – that’s just where I'm coming from right now.
Eric: That's just where I'm living guys.
Amanda: Oh, well, with visions of Timbly Tomblies dancing through my head. Thanks everyone for listening. We are so excited. And we'll catch you next time.
Brandon: Bye.
Julia: Bye.
Amanda: Bye.
Eric: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. But you can, because we're still doing free gifts. The party is still happening. Don't leave yet.
Amanda: Someone brought doughnuts.
Eric: Tim – someone brought Timbly Tomblies.
Julia: Amanda, we're out of popcorn.
Amanda: Oh, no.
Eric: Don't worry. I brought Timbly Tomblies. I just got chocolate and cinnamon because I know that’s what everybody likes.
Julia: Oh, my god. I like the jelly ones.
Amanda: I like the jellies.

About Us
Join the Party is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying podcast, powered by the rules of Dungeons and Dragons. That means a group of friends create a story together, chapter by chapter, that takes us beyond the tabletop to parts unknown. In the first campaign, we explored fantasy adventure, intrigue, magic, and drama. In the newest story, we tackle science, superpowers, a better future, and the responsibility to help others.
Every month, we sit down for the Afterparty, where we break down our game and answer your questions about how to play D&D and other roleplaying games at home. We also have segments at the beginning of each campaign to teach people how to play the game themselves. It’s a party, and you’re invited! Find out more at jointhepartypod.com.
Transcript
Amanda: Hey, hi, hello and welcome to the Pre-Game! That’s right. It’s a new thing. Welcome. Join the Party. Season 2. I feel like I’m starting a hip-hop album.
[all laugh]
Amanda: Cha!
Eric: Bam-bam-bam Desert Storm!
Julia: Oh no!
Amanda: [laughing] Oh no! What a bad beginning.
Eric: [chuckles] It’s one of my callouts.
Amanda: Julia, what would you- what would you call… [excitedly] OH, Julia’s here!
[all shouting and cheering]
Julia: Hey, what’s up? It’s me.
Amanda: Brandon’s also here.
Brandon: [emphatically] I’m BACK!
Amanda: Oh.
Eric: Oh jeez.
Amanda: Whoa.
Brandon: Like Space Jam!
Julia: Oh snap.
Brandon: Well, nearly.
Eric: No, explain that.
Brandon: Uh, Space Jam was a movie from a long time ago, in the ‘90s-
Eric: Good.
Brandon: And now it’s supposed to be coming back, but we’re not sure if it’s coming back, so just like my energy level, it’s hit or miss.
[all laugh]
Eric: Jesus Christ.
Amanda: Well, you may get the sense that this is the Join the Party you remember and love, but also with some new things because we’re starting a new campaign and we’re so excited about it. But just like how we try to teach folks how to play D&D, and how to make great podcasts as our broader kind of Multitude project, we wanted to document as much as we can the experience of starting a campaign.
What is it like to decide where you are going to play in, like, space, time, and fiction? How do you decide what you’re going to be? How do you put together a balanced party? So we are going to be recording all of those things and we’re calling it the Pre-Game.
Eric: It’s the Pre-Game. You ask your friends if your outfit looks good, you have like one drink but not too many, you all take a shot as you walk out the door, you play your chill playlist, but not your party playlist. So like, much less R&B. Or more R&B? I don't know what your pre-games look like.
Brandon: Eric, thank you for giving me the opportunity to be able to experience a thing I did not get to in college [laughs]
Amanda: There it is.
Julia: You’re not alone, Brandon, you’re not alone.
Amanda: Yeah, no. I was working.
Eric: Oh, yeah, I’m the weird one because I went to parties in college.
Amanda: Yeah, Eric.
Julia: Went to parties in college and now hosts D&D podcasts?
Eric: Yeah, like a cool kid.
Julia: Mhm.
Eric: Julia.
Julia: Mhm.
Eric: I don't like that Julia’s here. Can we find a new one?
Amanda: Oh no!
Julia: I’ll leave then.
Amanda: No!
Eric: While Julia leaves the studio, I’m gonna introduce what these Pre-Game episodes are going to look like. So this first one, we’re going to talk about the world and the characters. I have a sheet that I put together of initial ideas of kind of what the genre, what the setting, what the plot could look like. And we’re all gonna talk about it and really chew through it, and then figure out what the characters you're going to play - how they might fit in there, and how they will walk through the world.
Then in the second episode, we’re going to get into the D&D stuff. So the three players are each going to bring classes and subclasses that they might want to play as we put together the party construction of what we’re going to play together, and then I’m going to talk about what the podcast is going to look like.
We'll discuss together the release schedule, the format of the episodes, and really get into it. But I’m sure we have told you this information already. We’re recording this in December because we’re cool kids who like playing Dungeons & Dragons now, just so you know.
Brandon: It’s my holiday present from Eric.
Amanda: You’re presum?
Brandon: My presum!
Amanda: Aw!
Eric: But, we’re all gonna talk about it and we’re gonna start that here.
Amanda: So, Eric, this is not always how campaigns come together, right? Like sometimes you show up, and your DM Surprises you. Sometimes people show up with a character that they are burning to play, and then with their DM build a campaign around it.
For everybody here, how have the campaigns that you’ve been in started? Have you done this kind of progression where together you decide the world, then the kind of party, and then the characters specifically?
Julia: In my non-podcasting DM experience, I was given like, “This is what the world is going to be. This is the kind of campaign we’re going to be running,” and then I kind of created a character based on what I knew the structure of the campaign was going to be.
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: Yeah, mine have mostly been like, “Hey build a character and then come and we’ll have snacks and I’ll tell you about it.” For my DMing, my small amount of DMing that I’ve done, have all been for newbies I think, so I think I walked them through the character making process, which [strained] was a journey. And then I did like a prewritten campaign and just sort of walked them through it that way, and just sort of discovered the characters as we go.
Amanda: Yeah. And Eric, I’m sure on the DMing internet there’s tons of different approaches.
Eric: Yeah, it’s funny that you say that, because I spend a lot of time lurking and researching on r/dnd the reddit - the subreddit for D&D, and whenever someone has a problem, it’s like, “This player is like putting all of this gross shit in my campaign!” or “My DM doesn't care about my character!” It's like hey have you guys like to talk to each other? And they're like, “No I forgot about that. Huh.”
[all chuckle]
Brandon: As in all of life, communication is the answer.
Eric: Just talk to each other! But there are a lot of questions being like, “Hey I don't really like what my DM is doing” and it’s like you guys should have done a Session Zero. Which is really what this Pre-Game is, is that you’re talking about the game, the game you want to play, so that everyone is on the same page.
Even just like, “Hey, how grim-dark do you want this to be? How silly do you want this to be? Do you want this to be puzzle-focused? Do you want it to be combat focused? Do you want monsters? What are things you don't want to talk about?” And just like getting that out of the way is important, but we’re taking that a step further, how this story’s going to be a little bit more collaborative.
When we did Season 1 of Join the Party, I was just like, “Okay, I’ll go come up with a world. Let’s have a podcast.” [laughs] And like I did talk to everybody about their characters to start with, but I wanted everyone’s buy-in.
And like, yeah, this is the idea which I’m excited about which you'll see in a second. And I did a lot of the preliminary work, but I do want everyone to like tell me what they want to do and what's good. And I think that we can figure that out together.
Amanda: I think it’s also important to realize, even though we’re going to talk about this in greater detail next episode, that we are making a D&D podcast, so deciding the world that we want to play it, it’s on the Join the Party theme. Unlike the first episode, this is a world and a feeling that people understand. So as we’re determining our world, like what is in all of our minds that makes a Join the Party campaign and Join the Party setting.
Eric: I think there being space for humor and fun definitely needs to be in there. I think regardless of what we were doing when we were doing quasi-fantasy stuff, I called it “pop-culture fantasy” it’s like yeah if you can figure out how to make it in fantasy world, like it can fit in Game of Thrones, do it, but I think that what we’re gonna do here, I think there will be some space for jokes. Actually, I think it’s going to be easier to make jokes about it.
Amanda: Mmm. It’s important to me that we do something in an existing genre but in a new way, where similarly, like you were saying, for some of the high fantasy, traditional, kind of like knight D&D setting, we did that but there were differences. Like there wasn't homophobia, and there were opportunities to have interesting pop-cultural things. People had all kinds of professions. It wasn't limited by the existence of like no electricity, or only magic to run stuff. And we could kind of play and pick and choose the parts that interested us the most.
So, as we kind of talk about a more contemporary setting, that is important to me, where it’s something where we all understand the genre, we’ve all read and watched and you know, played video games in all these different kinds of genres. And we can talk intelligently, not just kind of inherit from an existing genre all the things that people have done before, but to ask ourselves what parts do we want to keep? Which do we want to introduce new things about or change? And really ask ourselves why.
Eric: Well, Amanda did just say it, but yes, we are going to do a modern times campaign.
Julia: Aw!
Amanda: It was a little tease!
Eric: A tease! It’s like, “Oh wait, did she say contemporary?!”
Amanda: A little aperitif.
Brandon: Amazing!
Julia: Aw, man, we’re not doing a grim, dark, “Game of Thrones” fantasy where it takes like five days to travel from city to city?
Eric: Yeah just low magic, it’s all travel…
Amanda: Julia, you can be Name of the Wind anytime you need to.
Julia: Oh no please.
Eric: No food. You have to hunt for your own food. If you don't sleep more than eight hours a day you die, because -
[all laughing]
Julia: Survival check! Survival check! Survival check!
Amanda: It’s too much like real life, Eric! I can’t do it!
Eric: I’m taking all of my stats from the Mayo Clinic, but it doesn't make sense because it’s 1340.
[all snickering]
Brandon: I think for me, going off what both of you said, is a part of the combination of the two, like the foundation for JTP for me is about inclusivity and welcomeness and the fact that when you walk away from an episode, yes it may be emotional, but you walk away feeling good about what you listened to. There’s no… it can be challenging but challenging in a way that’s uplifting and ultimately a joyful experience for everyone involved, including listeners and players.
Julia: Kind of jumping off that, I think the important part is, you know, this is a campaign and we’re having fun as friends, and when we have fun as friends it’s also fun for the audience who is therefore listening. So I think when it comes down to it, inclusivity and you know, making sure that people are being introduced to a thing that they know and love, but seeing a different twist on it, those are all super important things, and that’s what makes playing D&D with your friends fun.
Eric: Sounds good, let’s do that.
Julia: Do it! Ooo typing!
Amanda: Eric’s typing. Very quickly. No spaces.
Eric: I was hacking into the mainframe I’m sorry. So I think the best way to talk about this is to talk about the genre and time setting. As we said, this is going to be a contemporary campaign, a modern campaign, a 2020s - something, I like to think that it starts somewhere in 2020, which is weird because it does sound like the future-
Julia: It does.
Eric: - which is wild.
Amanda: But it is, as this episode’s being released, 2020 baby.
Julia: Oof.
Eric: I do not like that.
Brandon: That just hit me really hard.
Amanda: Yep.
Eric: Hold on. Brandon needs to sit in a room and sing “Mad World” to himself for a second.
[Brandon laughs]
Julia: Oh no.
Eric: So, I definitely want to start there. The genre that I want to work in, I think I want to do something powered. Like not superhero necessarily, but I think that we’re kind of like in the post-MCU phase. Like we’re kind of getting all of that out of our system in the back half of 2019.
Amanda: By which you mean traditional kind of like superhero narratives?
Eric: Yes, and we can talk about other things that explore people who have superhuman abilities, but it does not necessarily mean that you need to put on tights. I think that’s really where I’m coming out of this.
Because D&D, in the game, your heroes that you level up means that you are better, like, physically, and spiritually, and powerfully better than common folk. Like if you have an NPC or just a dude, they're supposed to be level 0, and your - because of the fact that you have powers, that makes you different. And I think that is something that fits with the superhero genre.
I was talking about this before, and I was like, What if we did a modern campaign? What if we did something where you had to do the stuff that you are doing now? Because I think that the current climate in which we are creating art - TM, TM, TM - is -
Brandon: Did you just “TM,” art?
Eric: Yeah. I love praxis.
[all laugh]
Eric: - Is like let’s strip away some of the layers. We don't have to be that metaphorical. I think that we are changing our world because it is powered now, but existing in a city, exploring what it means to be in a contemporary society, is very interesting to me right now.
Amanda: Yeah, and that was something- just to kind of catch everybody up on where we’re coming into this conversation- as Brandon, Eric, and I were talking about closing out Season 1 of Join the Party, and thinking about what would happen after that, we raised the idea like, if we did a new campaign, where would we want to set it? What kind of campaign?
And all of us were like, we’d be really excited to do something contemporary. Like that sounds really cool, it’s not something that we’ve heard a lot of, not something that we’ve played, so like yes, totally let’s do it. Someone was like, “I don't wanna do superheroes,” and we’re all like, “Yeah, true.” And we asked Julia and she was like, “Dope.” So here we all are, and that’s kind of the preliminary conversation we’ve had so far.
Eric: I would also say a modern campaign powered by Dungeons & Dragons.
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: Exactly, yeah. We considered talking about it, but we all like D&D. It’s a D&D podcast. We all like being able to teach folks how to play the game because we think it’s a really good start to playing RPGs and tabletop games more generally, so we wanted to stick with that. Also, I don't wanna learn more systems right now!
Julia: And I think there’s this certain kind of, like, empowering challenge to adapting classical fantasy D&D to a modern setting -
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Mhm.
Julia: - and figuring out how certain classes would work in a modern setting. And I just really like it.
Eric: [excitedly] That’s why we’re doing a whole episode about it!
Amanda: It’s so much fun!
Julia: Yay!
Eric: [high pitched, loud] Screeeeee! That’s my excited scree.
Amanda: Yeah, also if you play D&D in a modern setting, something has to be different. I mean, I guess you could use D&D mechanics to negotiate everyday life, but that sounds too much like what I do every day and don't wanna do it in fantasy.
Brandon: [laughs] Every time Amanda’s filling out a tax form, I see her rolling a d20. It’s very terrifying.
[all laugh]
Julia: And that determines what number she puts on all of the tax forms!
Amanda: Oh no. Don't tell anyone.
Eric: At the beginning of every day, she has a Blades in the Dark circle for getting things done and then another one for bullshit, and she has to fill in hers before she fills in the other one.
[Amanda laughing]
Julia: Checks out.
Eric: That is a deep cut just for me. So when we’re talking about genre, I said before that I was really inspired by Magic Realism because I personally love reading that stuff, I do have family from Argentina, so I’m very inspired by the Latin-American, South-American work of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and all that stuff.
A really big story for me that I really like is, “A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings,” is a short story that is very, very popular from Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It’s basically like an angel falls into a chicken coop and then like the town needs to deal with it. And then the way they deal with it is they turn him into a sideshow. But of course, they don't know if he’s an angel. He’s just an old man with wings. And I always liked the idea that something magical would drop in there.
Amanda: Yeah, it’s just such a perfect metaphor for magic realism as a genre. Like an incredible thing is suddenly right next to a completely ordinary thing, and then society as we know sort of has to deal with it.
Eric: And I think the moving forward of that, moving from that sort of South-American tradition into the larger like, everything that is powered and different sort of thing, is slipstream fiction, which Julia told me and I’m like, “Oh, this means everything that I want!”
Julia: Yes.
Eric: Basically, it's just like everything about sci-fi and fantasy, everything from “The Magicians,” by Lev Grossman, to like Karen Russell’s weird short stories, in “Swamplandia” there’s like everything in between, where something is strange or different. And I think it really encapsulates everything that we’re doing here, where you can reckon with the modern world, but there are different things happening here.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, it’s Jeff VanderMeer, it’s “The Subtle Knife.” There’s so many things that kind of fall in this genre. It’s my favorite.
Eric: Absolutely. Something that - inspiration points for me, the new “Watchmen'' series, oh my god! I watched - Amanda and I watched all of them in one day.
Amanda: Yup.
Eric: We watched six and then we watched Episode 7, which just came out. Other jumping off points, obviously “X-Men,” as the powered thing, and also about the difference between powered people and unpowered people really, as allegories for all -isms that exist. And it’s really interesting making a D&D podcast three years ago and now.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Because before, the only thing we had to compare it to was a not-finished Balance Campaign of “The Adventure Zone,'' and now we have so many other good contemporaries out there, like things to shoot for. So I felt very inspired by the Dimension 20 game “Unsleeping City.” That is very urban fantasy, so we’re - it’s not gonna be the same at all.
Julia: Not gonna have trolls and stuff…
Eric: We - not gonna have trolls, not gonna have Monster Santa.
Julia: Oh, but I liked Monster Santa.
Amanda: But what about the golem Willie who lives in Williamsburg?
Eric: He might appear, honestly. I thought that was very funny. Brennan Lee Mulligan, if you want to talk to me about your Jewish accent, we can talk about that, but other than that, very good.
Amanda: So, Eric, what about that do you kind of want to move beyond or like not include in this campaign?
Eric: I guess I’m trying to look at this through the prism of comics, because comics can move in so many different genre directions, so it’s like monsters can exist, and monsters can come from other dimensions, I guess, but they're like - they have their reasons and they have their own society in a different place.
But it’s like I don't want there to be like an underworld arcana that’s lurking under our city, like the magic needs to come - kind of like the way that Dr. Strange is magical, or like someone that can shoot fire out of their hands is magical. Like the power itself is like, “I can change time.” “I can shoot flames.” “I can be super strong.” But like the origin and the reason can be supernatural, it can be magical, it can be like from space.
Amanda: Biochemical.
Eric: Biochemical. Like you need your origin story accordingly, and I think we’re going to get into that is like why do our heroes have powers? Who has powers as compared to other people?
Amanda: Who knows about it?
Eric: Who knows about it? And also, we - I will have some jumping-off points about how your characters relate to their powers and who knows about it.
Julia: Amanda, I think we’re out of Doritos.
Amanda: Oh, shit. Okay, I have to go to the kitchen. One second.
[transition sound]
Eric: Hey, it’s Eric. Do you have a favorite pair of shoes? Whether it’s dress shoes that you only break out for special occasions or a pair of sneakers that you've worn every day for like two, three years, that almost has a hole in it but not yet? Or maybe, like me, you have a pair of boots that you bought with your first paycheck ever, and you only break out for real, really special occasions. Well think about the last time that you put them on. Remember how you felt. Remember how cool it sounded as you walked down a hallway. Remember how secure you were in your own steps. This is that moment, when you're confident that you can go anywhere. Welcome to the midroll. Your shoe is untied. Don’t trip.

Finally, we’re sponsored this week and every week by Twenty Sided Store. And I have been waiting for weeks to tell you how into Masks I am. For those of you who don’t know, Masks is a very good game. You play as a teenaged or young adult superhero, and it is probably the best way that the form of the game has followed the function, because it’s powered by the Apocalypse system, so you use playbooks. So you get things you can do, but your superpowers aren’t necessarily like actions. So you know in Dungeons & Dragons everything you do is an action, but like if you were a super strength hero, then throwing someone thirty feet across a park would not be an action, it’s just like a thing you can do. Also it focuses a lot more on the emotional toll of superhero stuff, which is my favorite part of superhero media, especially because you're a teenager or young adult and you have lots of that. In my game that I’m playing with Amanda and our friends from Tabletop Potluck, I’m playing a social media star named Wyvern who has dragon wings, and he’s famous for ripping off his personal from a fantasy series, and it’s very fun and I’m having a lot of fun. So, you can go get the Masks book or any other RPG book at 20 Sided Store in Brooklyn, NY. And you can also use jointheparty - all one word - for 20% off in store and online. So go, get Masks. It’s very good. And if you pick up your copy of Masks at Twenty Sided Store, use code jointheparty for 20% off in-store and online.
Alright, we are going to see you next week—yes! Just a week from now!—with the second of our four worldbuilding episodes. Then, on April 7, this new story begins with Episode 1. Ahhh, I can’t wait.
Alright, let’s get back to worldbuilding.
[transition sound]
Amanda: Julia, here are your Doritos!
Julia: Thank you!
Amanda: It’s a bowl with both Cool Ranch and the regular kind bisected by little dividers.
Brandon: Oh my god, that divider was so important. I was about to get very upset.
Amanda: Don’t worry, Brandon.
Julia: You cannot cross-contaminate them.
Amanda: I thought about saying divider first, but then I wanted to have that little moment of tension and then relieve your tension. Eric, can I DM now?
[all laugh]
Brandon: No.
Eric: Amanda, your D&D campaign would be like, “So your garden is looking a little overgrown”
[Julia gasps]
Julia: No, Amanda!
Amanda: It’s Stardew Valley basically. That’s my D&D campaign.
[all laugh]
Brandon: I would want to play that so bad.
Julia: I need to roll so many Nature checks.
Amanda: Yeah, don’t overwater it. That’s the only risk in this campaign.
[Brandon laughs]
Alright, back to the pregame.
Eric: Nice. Alright, let’s talk about the inciting incident and how people relate to their powers. So I have three different examples of how people can get powers. One is the X-Men route, is like it just happens and then - in your very small part of society - and then everyone else is just like, “Wow! Look at those people with powers! They are good!” or “They are bad!” so very small minority and then the majority makes judgements about them.
We can have the “My Hero Academia” route, because Julia and I are big ol’ anime nerds, is that everyone in the world knows a larger minority, or a majority, honestly, of people have powers and it’s just kind of like a thing and society works around it. Maybe there is a structure around superheroism as a job. or there is a structure about like the police force or the military force has these people it is integrated into society, and that has problems, but it is happening.
Or we have the Spider-Man route, the traditional superhero thing is that there was an inciting incident, some people have it, or some people have it for different reasons, some people know, most don't, but it is integrated into society as like a special thing. So I would say what interests you the most?
Julia: I’m always intrigued by what I will call the “Static Shock” option, which is the last one that you listed, where it’s like an inciting incident creates people in a certain area with superpowers and while people are aware of it, who’s actually affected either is or is not known. So I kind of like the idea of it being like a neighborhood that everyone in that neighborhood, or a decent population in that neighborhood got powers, and people know about that, but it’s not like a thing that is affecting everyone across the world, or across the country, or even across the entire city.
Amanda: Yeah, me too. I really love the idea of like being at the beginning of something, and seeing how the world reacts to a thing that is new to the world. And I definitely see a place for stuff where there is like an architecture of superheroism like, “My Hero Academia” is like a really interesting world to me, but I would rather be in a place where maybe we don't have to Spider-Man style, like roll Deception is if our babysitter believes that we are like going out to study and not to like save a school bus.
But I do want some kind of middle, where it’s not like an immediate threat where I must hide some Superman identity from my neighbors, but the world doesn't really know how to deal with this. Maybe the neighborhood's been dealing with it for a little bit and it’s not like a thing that’s day to day, but we aren't like seeing headlines, or we’re not seeing like legislation impacting this thing yet.
Eric: Also the difference in the X-Men route versus the Spider-Man route - most X-Men don't cover their face. I just realized that - that’s like not a thing. You have a codename, but you're not a secret identity. Spider-Man, when you might need to lie to somebody is when you have a secret identity. And that might be a function of superheroes and what we talk about. But maybe it’s like, do you cover your face? Does it matter? And why?
Brandon: Yeah, I also think it’s interesting - I think this might be an idea of sort of like if it’s one generation removed, then the world has sort of had enough time -
Eric: Mmm.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: - not to forget about the incident, like the incident is still lingering, the effects of, but…
Amanda: It’s like new on a different timescale.
Brandon: Yeah, and I think there might be something interesting in what Julia was talking about in like some people have powers, and people know that some people have powers, but it’s enough of a washed away that like we’re not quite sure who has powers.
It’s also the complexities of humanity, like yeah there might be, Eric just said, a celebrity who is the best swimmer of all time because they decided to be public with their powers, some people hide their powers because they’re ashamed of them or don’t understand them, or whatever it is, but I think that also interfaces interestingly with the political realities of it with like maybe the government is interested in harnessing something like this, but it might be political suicide to actually like enact a draft to get everyone on board or whatever it is.
Eric: Right.
Brandon: So like really interfacing with the humanity of it is interesting to me.
Eric: Another thing we need to talk about, is like do we want there to be no powers and then there are powers, because like that is also a cool thing, is like do the people who get powers, do they grow up with it or is it thrust upon them? It also might be their parents had it thrust upon them and now they have to deal with that.
So, I think that’s very interesting as well. And so the inciting incident could have happened in 2018, or it could have happened in 1980.
Brandon: Yeah, I like that a lot, because it’s interesting to me that maybe as capitalism also evolves, they might take advantage of these powers as well, like you might see advertisements for like Superhero Charge Burgers at McDonalds, or something silly like that.
Amanda: Right.
Julia: I think I really dig the like second generation of people with powers, if that’s where we’re going to place our characters in.
Amanda: Yeah, an idea that I had as we were just kind of kicking around this contemporary setting is like wouldn't it be cool if something happened and it impacted just your apartment building or just your block?
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: And it happened when everybody was kids, and now we’re all 30 and, like, for some reason we are called back home, or we come back home, or like something happens where our identities are revealed or something along those lines. But it’s enough time that maybe you have - it has nothing to do with your life as an adult, and now you’re kind of forced to come back and be in touch with these people.
I’m thinking about how I want to play a character that’s like the opposite of Inara, and one of those things is like being really close to people who have known you for a long time. And so that was kind of like exactly what we were talking about, like there’s some amount of decades that have happened between the inciting incident and now, but I would be down to explore second generation powers as well because, man, my parents and I have different ideas about everything, and I can definitely see-
Eric: Pew, pew, pew!
Amanda: - if our parents or our parents’ generation dealt with something like this, like of course us tumblr kids would have a much different idea of what is appropriate, or right, or how to live with it, or how to be open about it, maybe.
Brandon: Yeah, the relationship dynamic between the parents and the kids would be very different because for us, the generation, it’s like, well this is just everyday life.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: But for them, it was like a massive trauma. I do think, Eric, I mean it’s up to you, sort of, but I think for plot reasons, or for moving around the idea of sort of like an inciting incident that brings us back together is interesting. Sort of like, for a horrible example, “It 2,” you know.
Julia: Oh no. No clowns in this campaign.
Brandon: Yeah, no clowns, please… Uh oh.
Julia: I don’t like the look that just happened in your eyes there.
Eric: [singing “Mad World”] All around me are familiar faces…
Julia: I hate this.
Eric: So I guess this is where I wanna lay out some ideas that I came up with, and I want to hear y’all react to it. So let's talk about the inciting incident. We did talk about - let’s talk about the generational one. Let’s say it’s like 1981. Lots of people go from like New York City to a very small upstate town. Amanda and I just went to Lake Placid, so let’s talk about something in that area of the Adirondacks, 4, 5, 6 hours north of New York City, north of Albany.
And that’s important because Albany, for all of you who don't know, the capital of New York State. The whole point is that Albany was supposed to be like a smaller city and New York City was not the capital of New York State for reasons.
So let’s say that you go summering in this town that’s like 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 people max, right? Maybe all of your families do this together and that’s how you all know each other - friends as kids - again, this can change. Just an idea for how maybe your characters relate to each other.
So you all go summering together, right? As you are all in your respective cabins and it’s this kind of small neighborhood where people rent summer homes, maybe it’s around a lake, whatever. In one of the cabins, there is a mad scientist.
Julia: Of course, obviously.
Eric: But people don’t know he’s a mad scientist. He is messing around with something in his basement. Don’t worry, I do have Wikipedia pages open of “Water Supply Terrorism” and “List of Food Contamination Incidents.”
Amanda: Oh no.
Eric: Because whatever he’s messing around with gets into the water supply, the food supply, maybe the lake honestly. And the adults and the children play in that lake, they eat the food. But I think that also the effects of what happens when there’s a mass, like food poisoning and maybe they get - it’s radiation we can make up gamma rays or whatever the fuck we want to call it.
Julia: Tachyons - that’s a thing, right?
Eric: I love - tachyons is my shit!
Amanda: And yet darker, there are lots of examples of like war crimes and also industrial pollution where it affects children because, developmentally, it just impacts you more than the adults that are living there.
Eric: Right.
Amanda: So that can just be more of the lever we can adjust on how much -
Eric: Oh, I like that.
Amanda: Maybe the adults are just really healthy and live for a long time, you know?
Eric: Oh, that’s so good!
Amanda: And the kids are the ones that develop something that we would think of as superpowers.
Eric: [gasps] Oh, fuck! Your parents are just like super healthy and they assume that everyone is just super healthy, but then instead you have superpowers? That’s fucking insane!
Brandon: Wait, but then that would mean that the powers are secret?
Eric: This is still 1981, so the thing happens, and the energy, whatever the poisoning is, but the other thing that -
Brandon: But then within that next year, they feel really super healthy?
Eric: Yeah-
Amanda: Or within the next decades, so like everyone is just really healthy. It doesn't occur to anyone to question it, because what you see around you is just what life is just like. I guess we’re just lucky.
Eric: Also through the ‘80s too, so we could move this, and it could be like late ‘80s, early ‘90s.
Julia: Well you're also looking generationally too, like the teenagers might get powers before like the 3- and 4-year-olds, you know what I mean?
Eric: Yeah, but people - you can definitely have older siblings and whatever, so keep that open mind.
Brandon: I do like having the parents have some form of power though, to give the world a stepping off block, to be like oh this exists.
Amanda: Yeah.
Julia: Even if it’s like minor stuff, like enhanced agility, or stuff like that.
Brandon: Yeah.
Eric: Right. Oh for sure.
Amanda: Or memory.
Julia: Yeah, and then meanwhile their kids are like shooting fireballs.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Yeah, I like that. That’s good.
Amanda: And I really love this idea of like your parents telling you what is proper, and again we may be verging for individuals about what happens in our own lives, but this idea of just like a morality of like, this is how you use this thing. Like maybe you're not supposed to put your abilities to use for personal gain, because it’s just like a lucky thing we all have. And so if somebody decides to like go be a champion runner and everyone in their hometown knows it’s because they’re a Child of the Lake or whatever, and their parents are not super into that.
Brandon: Can I pitch you a very similar idea?
Eric: Yeah, gimme. Hit me.
Brandon: So there was a rocket scientist named Jack Parsons. Has anyone read or heard about his story?
Julia: Yeah, he - there’s’ a great biography about him, called like, “Sex Rocketships” or something else.
Amanda: Oh.
Brandon: Yes, I’m in the middle of that right now.
Eric: Brandon, why didn’t you lead with “Sex Rocketships.”
[Amanda laughs]
Brandon: I don’t think it’s - it’s… what is it called? Anyway…
Eric: It’s called “Sex Rocketships.” [laughing] No, Julia! Don’t look it up!
Julia: I want to!
Eric: It’s called “Sex Rocketships!”
Julia: No it’s like sex, comma, rocketships, comma, and another thing.
Amanda: Like sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll?
Julia: Yeah, basically.
Eric: Sex, drugs, and rocketships.
[all burst out laughing]
Julia: Listen, that’s pretty close to what it is.
Amanda: That’s my wedding theme.
Brandon: Um, so the story of Jack Parsons is really interesting - so he was a rocket - back before rockets were actually a thing, people were like, “Rockets are never going to work. It’s like science fiction.”... what is Julia?
Julia: It’s literally called “Sex and Rockets.”
[Amanda and Eric cheering]
Eric: Sex rockets!
Julia: “The occult world of Jack Parsons”
Brandon: Oh, I’m reading “Strange Angel,” that’s why-
Julia: Oh, okay. I’m reading the cool one.
Amanda: Brandon’s like, “There’s no sex rockets in this book!”
Eric: Also known as Strangle. [laughs]
[Julia giggles]
Brandon: So Jack Parsons was this rocket engineer before rockets were a thing. No one really thought that rockets were going to be a thing, it was sort of sci-fi. So he was literally in his backyard in a shack essentially in Pasadena, and he was working on rocket fuels and his jack exploded, and that’s how he died essentially.
Amanda: Oh jeez.
Brandon: But I like this idea that, yeah a mad scientist, but something slightly more grounded where someone is working on a rocket, or military technology that may be exploded into the air, and maybe the children were swimming in the lake at the time so they got washed off, but the parents were at a picnic or something, so the debris sort of fell within them.
Amanda: Oh that’s interesting.
Eric: Interesting.
Brandon: Instead of like polluting something, because I don't want to destroy the world in our campaign.
Eric: Well it’s not - this is what I’m talking about, because I had to say “mad scientist” I think this is related to what you're talking about rockets is that he’s trying to make energy, the way that tesseract also is like a perpetual motion machine, I think it’s also related to that. Because I do think that there needs to be some sort of pollution here, and that-
Amanda: Or a contamination, not a pollution.
Eric: Yeah.
Amanda: Maybe it’s like expended solar cells and he’s like -
Eric: It is contamination.
Amanda: - throwing them on the bonfire that all the adults are around because the kids are in bed, and then there’s like particulates or a radiation wave or something.
Brandon: I like that a lot.
Eric: So here’s what happens is that he actually did it. He figured out a cleaner, newer energy source. Because as for people who are reading or know about “Watchmen,” Dr. Manhattan pushed this alternate United States into this new scientific age, because the energy that he created- whatever his radiation thing- like, powered watches.
And that was my favorite thing in the new “Watchmen” was that you could see the blue watches that he made, so I like that. So now the tiny town grows because they have the energy. It then grows to a city, and that city then takes the seat of power of New York State from Albany and it becomes the new city, because New York State is pushing into the future.
Brandon: I love that.
Eric: And of course, like, now we can build a city from scratch.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: What does it look like when you start a city in 1985?
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: And I’m super excited about all of that. We can also like make it like the quiet year, the way that we establish that stuff. We can just do a whole city building day, if we really want to. The only thing that I really want to keep… [laughing to self] You know in New York City when you're walking through- I think the East Village is the closest thing- and you see those townhouses that are only like two feet tall? I’ve so fallen in love with that because it’s a relic of New York City that New York City has decided to keep and is historical, so what if like the neighborhood that you all live in of just the cabins is, like, in Central Park and it’s the Historical District-
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: I love it.
Eric: And like the people who lived there as like reparations for EPA pollution contamination, whatever, has a preserved neighborhood and everyone who went there and got hurt can still live there if they want to.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: I love that.
Julia: I really, really like that.
Eric: And I also love having a neighborhood inside of - and this is how I feel about Greenpoint - having a neighborhood inside of the city.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Yeah, and I think there’s also again interesting themes we can play with. Like I see a lot of motivations for NPCs we might meet, like what is proper? What is defending our life? What is embracing modernity? What does it mean to live in the city in 2020 as opposed to what it did in 1980?
Eric: Yeah.
Julia: I also love that we’re setting our inciting incident in the ‘80s because my college thesis was on environmental apocalypticism during the ‘80s.
Eric: Mmm.
Julia: And so this is just like everything coming to its peak, and like the different religious movements that kind of came out of it, as like we have to be the earth’s keeper because God entrusted us to - God entrusted it to us.
Brandon: That’s interesting.
Amanda: We’re not the Oneida Silver Company but we’re not not the Oneida Silver Company. In terms of a city profiting from a cover story. Oh, do you know what this is, Brandon?
Julia: Oh! Can I?
Amanda: Oh, please, Julia.
Julia: Basically Oneida was a cult that was formed in Oneida, New York, which is an upstate area and is named after the Native Americans that lived in the area. And it was started as a cult basically to create Heaven on Earth.
Amanda: As so many do.
Julia: And they were going to do that by basically creating a system that he based off of like reading Genesis, where like he created marriages and only certain people could have sex and -
Amanda: Basically eugenics.
Julia: It’s super eugenics, yeah.
Brandon: Oh, super bad.
Amanda: Yeah. He could have sex with whatever people he wanted at whatever age.
Brandon: Of course.
Julia: Of course.
Eric: Isn’t that the benefits of the 60s?
Amanda: Oh no.
Julia: But one of the things that they would do in order to make money for the cult, because they are a cult and they need money in order to survive, because no one can have real jobs, is they created a Silver Company, so like silverware, plates and mugs and whatnot - and it still exists to this day, because when he died, his son was like, “I don't know about this cult stuff, but the silver’s great!” and they still make silver!
[Eric cracking up]
Amanda: Yeah, it’s like you can buy Oneida Silver. It’s a company.
Eric: That is amazing.
Julia: Like we talked about on “Head, Heart, Gut.” All these fuckin’ frivolous forks out here, the forks in class consciousness…
[all laughing]
Amanda: Yeah, no, exactly.
Brandon: No I love that. There would definitely be some sort of environmental cult in the city.
Eric: Has to be.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Ooo.
Julia: Heck yes.
Brandon: I think that maybe they dig a canal and the lake becomes a port city, because it’s that important or something.
Amanda: Those Great Lakes ports.
Eric: I think that is interesting, especially if like depending on how big the lake is and then it becomes the push and pull of historical things, but if you improve upon the historical thing, do you still hold that - I do like putting a fucking - like it becomes a canal all the way to the Hudson River.
Julia: Yeah, that’s what I was thinking.
Eric: To make it define the fact that it’s a city.
Amanda: Or Lake Champlain. Yeah and then you like to make a river - you extend the Champlain River down the Vermont-New York-Massachusetts border.
Eric: Hell yeah! I’m just writing a canal in big [laughing...] I’m gonna do a bunch of research into the Erie Canal, it’s gonna be sick.
Julia: Oh, Amanda’s favorite thing.
Amanda: I really love canals. And my thesis was on Agricultural Reactionism, like people after the recession quitting their - or losing their jobs and then deciding to become farmers when they were not generationally agricultural producers. And I think there’s a real kind of, again, reaction against things that you disagree with in the world and trying to like find meaning and purpose in connecting with the land somehow.
So I see a lot of ways in which, depending on the, if it’s energy, if it’s clean like whatever else, the technology was, there may be a real sense of Utopia and this is the way forward, and like we are a model city, but there may well be issues under the surface that people aren't seeing in the like capital-D Discourse about the city.
Eric: I like that.
Brandon: Yeah, I like that too.
Eric: Just for nitpicking sake, I think we might need to move this towards the ‘90s so that everyone can be like 30, just because I think that’s interesting and being Millennial, like right in the target of Millennial is interesting for all the things we’re talking about, but I do want to use everything, Julia, that you’re talking about and just like move it forward like six years.
Julia: Heck yeah. Let’s do it up.
Brandon: There can also be something if you do wanna do the ‘80s, there can be something where like the only tell of a power is that you age slightly slower than everyone else.
[“Mmm”s from everyone]
So by the time you’re 40, you look 35. So it’s not really a tell, but by the time you’re 80, you're like, “Oh that person definitely had powers.”
Julia: That’s my superpower. Everyone tells me I look 17!
Amanda: Yeah, I guess that would be very noticeable for the parents’ generation.
Brandon: Yeah.
Amanda: Versus, there’s not much difference between a 30-year-old that looks 30 versus like 25.
Eric: I kind of love the idea that your parents are 60 and look 35, and you are 29 and you look 27.
[all laugh]
Because you have other powers that went into a different way -
Amanda: Yeah look like your sister, oh god.
Julia: Yeah, “Mom!”
Eric: So that becomes a whole thing. I also like the ‘90s more and I have more cultural understanding of the ‘90s than I do the ‘80s.
Julia: Sure.
Brandon: Some of the other fun things I was thinking about were just like I think the wealth gap would be huge in that town.
Julia: Yeah.
Amanda: Yes.
Brandon: And then something just thinking about my childhood, like the historic district might become one of those things where teens, like young teens or preteens maybe like oh do you wanna go like explore the haunted area? Like the legend of the town, you know?
Amanda: Oh that’s cool!
Brandon: So like annoying teens are always trying to break into your house or something [laughs]
Amanda: Yeah, or maybe it becomes a kind of like Gramercy Park enclave, and I’m sorry for those who don't live in New York, but that’s where we all are, but it’s like a park that’s literally fenced off and you only have a key to it if you live in some of the multi-million dollar brownstones that like ring the park.
Brandon: I love that.
Amanda: So I think it’s kind of everything from like oh this is a colonial village that it’s kind of preserved and people can walk around, and it’s like a public resource even though that used to be my home, or all the way to like maybe it’s literally fenced off, or cordoned off, or a park or a canal around it from the rest of the city. And it’s some kind of like, this is an area that people only who live there have a right to be, and so it picks up a mythos.
Julia: They have one model house. The rest of them are occupied, but they get the one model for school tours and stuff.
Amanda: Yeah, maybe.
Eric: That’s very funny.
Brandon: There was a mansion that burned down in my hometown that -
Amanda: Very good.
Brandon: Yeah, and it was a weird - a really weird, reclusive family, and so when it burned down, they sort of had like a small graveyard they built, and it’s out in the middle of nowhere. It’s Texas so it’s like -
Julia: Oh no.
Brandon: It’s really weird but then they built - later they built a college down the block, so kids would go and try to like explore the cemetery, but it’s on the college campus so it’s like, “Hey can y’all not?” like “We’re trying to study math!”
Eric: I do love that, that there's an NYU in this city and it’s just like - it’s like one of the Welcome Week activities is like let’s go explore the Historic District! So a bunch of 18-year-olds are just like walking by your parents’ house.
Brandon: Yeah, exactly.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: I also think it’s interesting to think about the small government town -
Amanda: Right.
Brandon: - And how they are going to be suddenly thrust into the global spotlight.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: I don't know what that is there, but I think that’s interesting.
Eric: Also, I did want to move the seat of state power to there because we’re going from Albany there, so there's the mayor - I don't even know anything about the mayor of Albany, but I always think that it’s interesting…
State politics is so interesting to me, especially as New York City as we relate to the rest of the state, and I’m sure that any one of everyone else out there who live in an urban center that is not the capital of your state, how everyone talks about your city everywhere else in the state, and like the distribution of budget and all that. So I find that all really interesting, especially as they push and pull of- is this the Gotham to New York City’s Metropolis? Because Gotham is just like Newark.
[all laugh]
So that’s interesting because what if they were also 6 hours away? But it matters less when you have powers? I don't know, I find that super interesting.
Brandon: I do too. Like how would the mayor of New York City treat this newfangled guy from the backwater, you know?
Amanda: Probably with distaste and hostility, Brandon.
[Eric bursts out laughing]
If the world has anything to go by.
[all laugh]
Eric: Oh man.
Amanda: I think that’s a fun part of kind of traditional superheroes and comics, is the sort of idea that we are like a city of the future, and to try to figure out what a version of that would look like now is really fascinating to me.
Like there would definitely be wealth inequality, and top look at a city and say hey you have a precious gift and resource and how are you going to use it to enrich everybody and not just the few who kind of own the property, literally, or intellectually of it. Like do you embrace that? Do you truly become a socialist and equal city? Or do you kind of repeat some of the mistakes of the past?
Brandon: Love that.
Eric: Mhm. I think I have a lot to work on, and I think this is great. I do, as long as we have some time here, I want to talk about the relationships of your characters. You don't have to say anything about yourself. You can if you want, but I think that the reason you all know each other is that you are childhood friends.
Julia: Yeah.
Eric: Or you're family friends in this way. It depends how the inciting incident goes. If you want this to happen in the ‘80s when the adults are in their 20s, and like they're all friends from college, and then alter they have children, and they're the ones who have powers- So that might be the difference, so it’s like either you knew each other and were like kids below ten when the incident happened, or you're family friends because your parents are bonded in this way.
Julia: Right.
Brandon: I think there might be something interesting also relating to the world in like if you were born in this center, that’s why you get to live in this Historic District.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: Yes, but I think there is a government act that has put the Historic District together and has distributed, safely, the energy created by the rocket scientist, mad scientist.
Brandon: Yeah, but then if you are a child that then moves to Minneapolis and has a child, you're giving up your birthright, which is interesting.
Eric: Yes, one hundred percent.
Julia: Yeah.
Brandon: I like the idea, personally, of our parents being good friends and us as children - you know how when your children you're sort of being forced together.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: Because that gives us some little push and pull of, oh yeah I do remember you from childhood but they might have a reason for why we didn't really keep super connected throughout our lives.
Julia: I like the idea of like, in particular, just from my personal experiences, of when your like family are friends and then they have an older sibling, and that older sibling just does not want to talk to you because you’re four years younger than them and oh my god how embarrassing.
Amanda: Yeah.
Brandon: That’s very good.
Amanda: Yeah, me too. And I think that gives us a lot of kind of agency with our individual characters as well. I think we can kind of decide what we want it to be- like maybe it is either you are in or out, and someone might have chosen to leave and then come back and thighs are a lot different and the thing that they thought they gave up is a lot more valuable than they realized.
Or maybe it’s like, hey everyone who owned this property, or this timeshare, or was here this summer counts, and then you can kind of come back and decide to pick up that legacy or not. But you can kind of - if someone wanted to totally embrace, if they wanted to be a townie, or if they wanted to go away and not, I want all of us to be able to make that decision for ourselves.
I like the idea that some of us have stayed, and some of us have tried to leave, but something like pulls us back. It’s a good kind of inciting incident.
Eric: One hundred percent.
Julia: I really like that.
Eric: I think that's really cool. I do like no we can make this in the ‘80s and we can use that stuff. If the parents like, three of them were college friends, and they all had their partners, and they all summered together in this place - I also love the idea if they were in their 20s, and they were all living together in New York City in the ‘80s, and now they’re forced to move their fucking lives because they have like infected. It started out as a quarantine and now it’s a Historic District.
Brandon: I love that.
Eric: Like one of your fucking parents needs to be a sculptor.
[all laugh]
Just choose one of you, I’m making it happen. And like they had to leave their shit in New York City, and they had to come to this town that became a burgeoning city, and like lost their dreams, and now they're like a government worker.
Brandon: I love that, because now you have the push and pull of like, well I’m only here because this was the only option, but then the child wants to embrace their legacy or not. That’s interesting.
Eric: Right.
Julia: Ooh.
Eric: I will say as we wrap this thing up, I am making sports teams in this city. I hope that one of you engages with it please. Just so you know [laughing]
Julia: Yes.
Amanda: I wanna buy the merch!
Julia: I will make you a jersey of whatever team you play-
Eric: [excitedly] Oh please! Please, I didn’t even think of that! We’re gonna have a basketball team and a hockey team, so pick which one!
Julia: You’re gonna get a basketball jersey.
Eric: Hell fucking yes!
Amanda: Yay!
Julia: I’ll get a hockey jersey and we can match.
Eric: Yes! Yes! Yes! It’s the only reason why I’m doing this. But yeah, please. I will tell you everything you need to know. Amanda, you’re into hockey now.
Amanda: I am!
Eric: Can you be into hockey?
Amanda: I saw one Predators game, and their mascot’s a catfish, and now -
[Brandon cracking up]
Now I just - I love everything. It’s wonderful.
Julia: Wait, I’m sorry, the Predators’ mascot is a catfish?
Eric: It’s a -
Amanda: It’s unofficial.
Julia: Oh, okay.
Eric: It’s a sabre-tooth tiger, but they have a thing -
Amanda: - who is very cute.
Eric: They have a thing where they throw catfish when they score.
Amanda: Don’t worry about it.
Eric: Similar to how the Red Wings throw Octopuses.
[everyone talking at once]
Amanda: Do you know how I found this out?
Brandon: Actual octopuses?
Eric: That is a tradition.
Amanda: There’s-
Brandon: Like actual octopuses?
Eric: In Detroit, they throw octopuses on-
Brandon: Like raw?
Eric: Yeah.
Brandon: That is such a waste of food. That sucks.
Julia: Also hard to get in Detroit.
Brandon: Also expensive.
Amanda: Also hard to get off the ice. And hard to sneak through security. Like did someone freeze it, stick it under their shirt with duct tape and then bring it to the arena to throw? Yes, they did.
Eric: That happened recently, and that one was in Nashville, and it was a catfish.
Amanda: I learned this because whenever the Preds score, there is a video of Tim McGraw throwing a stuffed catfish into the audience, and I’m like what’s happening.
Eric: And singing, “I like it. I love it. I want some more of it.”
Amanda: Yeah, incredible.
Eric: It’s amazing. Hockey is very good.
Brandon: Eric, to make my world better, I do want poutine.
Eric: That’s fine.
Brandon: That will just make me joyful.
Eric: Yeah, I think - that’ll be really close… Oh, that’s an interesting thing. It’s going to be very close to some Canadian cities. It’s going to be the biggest city other than Toronto in that area.
Amanda: Yeah.
Eric: So that’s actually very interesting.
Julia: Very cool.
Amanda: Currently, if you're in the Adirondacks, you drive to Plattsburg for the mall-
[Julia gasps]
So that’s what we’re dealing with here.
Eric: Alright, we’re gonna get into the D&D stuff next. But we’re still Pregaming guys, so keep the R&B or not R&B one because we’re not going to the party yet.
Brandon: Pass the Cheeto puffs!
Amanda: Eat something!
Julia: Get the Fireball out!
Amanda: Eat something!
Eric: One shot of Fireball! We’re excited!
Julia: Woo!
Amanda: No! Have dinner first!
Eric: Okay, we’re all gonna have dinner, then we’re gonna take a shot, and then we’re gonna chill, and then we’re gonna talk about D&D.
Amanda: Yay!
Brandon: Can we eat octopus?
Eric: I mean if you want. That’s up to you. Bye!
Julia: Bye!
Brandon: Goodbye!
Eric: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. Well actually stay here because it’s a party.
Amanda: Stay here because we’re pregaming.
Eric: We’re pregaming, exactly.
Amanda: And then we’re gonna go. Alright. Okay. Bye."
