PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-1-welcome-to-strumlotts,Ep. 1 - Welcome to Strumlotts,"Ep. 1 - Welcome to Strumlotts[Theme song begins playing]Host: Hey everybody, welcome to bomBARDed, an actual-play DnD podcast with a musical edge to it. For those of you who don't know us, we are in the band Lindby, and we play around Dallas, Fort Worth, Texas, and, you know, we've been playing DnD separately for, you know, just a while now, and we thought it'd be fun to bring a different spin to the game, especially for all of you listening out there. I've got three player characters with me. I'm Kyle. I'm going to be your DM. Each of our characters are going to be a multi-classed character, their initial class being related to their backstory, but they've just discovered their bardic abilities, and as many of you know, if you play DnD, the bardic abilities are going to be through their instruments, so that's their magical focus. So, we're looking on taking that magical focus, and really just emphasizing that point with our podcast. So, what's going to be happening is we're gonna be starting off with our bards going to Strumlott's, that's going to be Strumlott's School of Barding, that way they can hone their newfound musical abilities. Again, my name's Kyle. I'm going to be DMing this musical adventure, and to my right is-Goodrich: My name's Goodrich, and, uh, my name's actually Nick Goodrich, but Spurrier over here's also named Nick, so in order to avoid confusion, we're just going by our last names, which we do normally anyhow.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: But, I'll probably be calling y'all by your character names, just to, you know. We're gonna strive for immersion. Goodrich: We'll strive for that, surely. But yeah! So my character's named Raz'ul, and he is the son of Daz'ul. So, Razzle Dazzle-Son.[Laughter from other players]Goodrich: He's a dwarf druid from the Mount Tain, and he is-[Laughter]Goodrich: Yeah, I know, I worked hard on that one. He's from the Oodalolly clan. He's not um, a druid, like he wasn't born like a druid. He became a druid which kind of goes into backstory, which we'll get into later. He's part of the Circle of the Moon, which means he can transform into some different animals, which I'll get into more here in a second. He plays a guitar, so, and if you're gonna picture it in your mind, it's an exact amalgamation, like conglomeration, of Marceline's axe bass and Gene Simmon's axe bass, right? Kyle: Nice.Goodrich: Okay, so I looked it up, and I know it's not super innovative to have, you know, an axe as a guitar, but-Kyle: I guess it's a little on the nose- Goodrich: I know, but-Kyle: It's your axe.Goodrich: I just wanted to do that so bad.Kyle: No, no,Spurrier: But you're using it to actually fight with too, right?Goodrich: Right, so yeah, that's for practicality's sake. I can use it to fight, but it's also just a, uh, I can use it to cast my bard spells and what not. Kyle: Maybe I should throw a percentage in there if your guitar goes out of tune when you whack somebody with it. [laughter]Kyle: We'll see what happens. We'll play it by ear like musicians do.[Players agree]Goodrich: So, anyways, my axe's name is Usumptin, that's another one I worked real hard on, the Axe Usumptin. [Someone groans]Goodrich: Uh, yeah. That's kind of all about Raz'ul that we'll get into now. His story... A lot of good stuff planned for him that'll come up later on.Kyle: That's funny. Me too.Goodrich: [laughs] Thanks, Kyle. But yeah, so his flaw is, since being a druid isn't his first thing- Again, not to get into backstory we'll do that later, the one thing he can't get down, which is his flaw, is that whenever he tries to transform into an animal, he can't control what animal he transforms into. So, I have a list, me, Goodrich, have a list, if I roll a d100, and we've broken it up into twenty-five different categories, and so if I get in a certain area, that'll be the animal that I wind up transforming into. And we did kind of try to make it to where the lower the number, kind of the worse off I'll be. Kyle: Right.Goodrich: Or the weaker the animal, the higher the number.Spurrier: I think you can't do flying ones yet. As you level up-Goodrich: Yeah I can't do flying ones or swimming ones, but we did build into it like a super-duper bonus for getting like a crit, I guess? So if I roll between 97 and 100, I have an animal I transform into that's outside of my challenge rating, so it's just kind of like a little-Spurrier: Hulk out a little.Goodrich: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: Good power boost there.Goodrich: And if I do a crit failure, it's real bad. And we won't get into that, yeah. But-Kyle: And well, I mean, to add to it, when people think about dwarves, they think about the traditional, under the mountain and mining and everything, and that's definitely what your clan does, so it makes sense that you probably haven't spent a lot of time out in nature until as of recent, so you're like, what's that animal again? Oh yeah, that's- You think of something, but your mind sees something else.Goodrich: Well, I don't even know that it's that. I think that it's just like, he tries, like, I want to transform into say, like a giant spider or something, and I picture it, and just for some reason, he just pops out into else random, or maybe it is what he wants, but he just doesn't have control over it, and there's- He doesn't know why yet. It's always- So that's his flaw, kind of. And then I did roll for a random item, and the random item I got was a needle that never bends. Yeah, that's Raz'ul in a nutshell. Kyle: So we'll move on to Spurrier. Tell us a little bit about your character.Spurrier: Yeah, so I'm Spurrier, and again, not going by Nick just for sake of ease, but we'll be using our character names. Speaking of which, I am playing a character by the name of Randy Greentrees. He is a halfling rogue and is specialized as an arcane trickster, which means that I can use rogueish spells, but again we won't go into the backstory like we talked about, but he's not a rogue by choice. In his past, he was taken from his life and led down the rogueish life, which actually ties well into my flaw, which due to that, I cannot read. And uh-[laughter]Spurrier: We'll see how that plays into the story, and the adventures that Randy goes on-Goodrich: Wait, but you can- You just can't read Common, right? So any- Like, you can read other things?Spurrier: No, I can't read at all.[Players talking over one another]Kyle: You just can't use like- Yeah. Spurrier: I think we said I can also only count to twenty because of fingers and toes-Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: I think that was mentioned, so. Kyle: But you have to take off your shoes.Spurrier: Yes, okay, good.Kyle: Because if you can't- You have to see your toes.[laughter]Spurrier: I guess if I'm a halfling, I'm probably not even wearing shoes.Goodrich: That's a good point.Kyle: That's true.Ali: That's the way to go.Spurrier: I've got the sweet feet meat.Kyle: You've got Thieves' Cant down, so you know like the symbols and everything that they use, but-Spurrier: Yeah, visuals I'm good with.Goodrich: You're more of a tactile learner.Spurrier: Exactly. I like the pictures. Randy's awesome at Pictionary. Fantasy Pictionary. So yeah. So, uh, oh! I should say, he's from the Hemp Hills, which is where his family's from before he went off on the rogueish life style. Instrument is an organ, kind of a little portable one. Um... The only other thing- My little trinket are some daggers that I inherited, that have been passed down, and actually, I can use those as regular daggers too. So. And that's pretty much Randy.Kyle: Right on. Randy.Ali: Yeah. It is.Goodrich: So we made it easy by using our last name, and then we made two characters that start with R A.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: The law of averages there, but that's fine.[laughter]Kyle: Excellent, and our next player character is Ali. Why don't you tell us a little bit about your person?Ali: Sure, yeah. So I'm Ali, and my character, her name is Yashe'rak Bordun, but she'll go by Yashee, so not starting with an R. You're welcome.[laughter]Kyle: Thank you. I appreciate that.Ali: She is a half-orc barbarian, and she's kind of from the road. Her parents were traveling entertainers. Her dad was actually a bard, and her mom was a barbarian. You know they have their hometowns and homeplaces, but she really just grew up on the road. Kind of scrapping and entertaining and everything.Goodrich: Scrapping and entertaining, like you do.Ali: So she was sometimes part of her parent's entertainment. She played the spoons, and she'd hambone a little bit- Kyle: Do some of that good hamboning.[laughter]Ali: -which, yeah, which she grew kind of a strange obsession for, and so one of her flaws is she steals spoons. She kind of has to like have one from every area. You know, it's just one of those weird things. She'll just sneak off, and see a spoon-Goodrich: Do you combine, does she combine the spoons to get different timbres, different sounds?Ali: Yeah, um-Kyle: You're searching for um, maybe like-Ali: The perfect spoon.Kyle: Yeah, yeah, the perfect spoon.Ali: I have my one spoon, and I'm looking for the perfect match to make the sound-Goodrich: Aw.Ali: So, that'll occasionally happen. The guys might not know for a while, but, you know, I'll be sneaking around for spoons.Goodrich: You're like a giant barbarian Cinderella. Looking for her perfect spoon match.Ali: Yeah. [laughs]Kyle: That's right.Ali: And then my instrument, I'm handling the percussion here, so I have a pair of hammer mallets that are like enchanted with arcane magic that my father gave me, and then I also inherited my mother's maul, which is like a bass drum kind of thing. Then my little trinket thing, my random object that I got, is a parchment that has a mechanical schematic on it, and I don't really know what it is yet, or what it's for, but it seemed interesting, so I grabbed it and carry it with me.Goodrich: It's probably instructions on how to build an actual drum set.Ali: Yeah. Maybe.[laughter]Ali: I'm not the smartest, so I kind of just turn it around and like, no. You know what?Kyle: Is it upside down?Ali: Maybe it is. Maybe I'll meet someone that can help me with this.Goodrich: Give it to Randy, he'll read it for you.[laughter]Ali: Yeah, you know.Kyle: Oh man.Ali: Yeah, that's Yashee.Kyle: Excellent. No, that's fantastic. I'm really excited about getting into this. I think we have a good trio on our hands. Of course, since y'all all have your different backstories, y'all are all going to kind of meet at Strumlott's. You won't really know each other, so that's going to give y'all the opportunity to kind of parse things out. Get to know each other, and figure out who each other are. So, you know, that'll be where our first episode takes us. Before we get into this, I just want to say a couple of things for those who may have not played DnD before. Pretty much what we're going to do is each of our player characters have a character that has different modifiers based off of their stats, like strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. Those are your base stats that affect all of your abilities and skills. So what they'll do is they'll roll a twenty-sided dice, and that's pretty much your standard dice you're going to roll. Your weapons may have different damage, like some swords do a d6, others a d8, but yeah, so they'll be rolling that, and we'll have them- We're going to try to have them state their full roll. Like list the d20 roll then add their modifier.Aside from those dice, we're also going to be rolling- We're going to try to write a song for y'all pretty much every episode. So and everything in those songs will be made up on the spot. We'll take a minute, you know, write up the lyrics, and we're going to keep that also in the aleatoric essence of the game, and roll chord dice that Spurrier bought. Pretty much there's just seven chords on an eight-sided dice, and there's a wild one, we haven't figured out what we're doing there yet. But yeah, we're going to roll those, and they're going to take the chords that they're given and write a song appropriate to the scenario going on. Other than that, I guess we should go ahead and get rolling.[Music plays to indicate the beginning of the adventure]Kyle: So, you're headed to Strumlott's, which in this world of- In this land of Beetzart as its called. Y'all are getting involved in that, and of course the school isn't like- Y'all aren't like super young or anything. The school admits any and all people who are willing to learn, but y'all send in a letter to enquire, and you received a letter back saying, ""Be at this place, this date, this time-""Goodrich: Saying you're a wizard, Harry. [laughs]Kyle: [laughs] Yeah, no, it did come by owl-Goodrich: Welcome to Strumlott's.Kyle: -you know. It wasn't- Yeah, no, it was the mailing system of Beetzart. That's how-Goodrich: How is that, Kyle?Kyle: It mails really quickly? I don't know. It's like tubes. It's a tube system, why not. Goodrich: Y'all have pneumatic tubes in the forest where I got my- Kyle: It's an underground system. The drow run it. Y'all all know that. Alright-Goodrich: It's like the mafia picking up your garbage.Kyle: Yeah, yeah, exactly. You make your way to where the letter tells you to, and you follow this road, and at the end of this road you only see a series of lush green rolling hills that span out in front of you. But you do notice that there are ten other people that are waiting around, and they're all dressed up in bardic gear. Everybody looks like they're there for the same reason. Some are chatting. Some others are kind of keeping to themselves. Some of them look kind of like, cocky, like I'm too good to, you know-Goodrich: Musicians are like that Kyle.Kyle: -talk to y'all. You know, there are some out there, but that's to be seen. Y'all are waiting around and eventually an eleventh person walks up, and it's this human who's standing about five and a half feet tall. He has a butler just like, dragging a trunk behind him. He looks kind of, you know, well-to-do, really nice clothing, but looks really, really smug, and he just says-Kyle (as the cocky guy, who has sort of a New Jersey/old timey gangster accent): Ah, what the hell is this place supposed to be a joke or something? How long have y'all all been waiting here?Goodrich: And Kyle, the three of us haven't met before?Kyle: No, y'all haven't met. Y'all all arrived at your own little points.Goodrich: So we're just three faces in the crowd.Kyle: Exactly. This is all an individual take-Goodrich: Gotcha. So, this guy just talks-Kyle: Yeah, this guy just kind of walks up and looks smug, and he's just like-Kyle (as the cocky guy): How long y'all been waiting here? Is this some kind of joke or something? I'm here for some real business. Kyle: You know, and people kind of look around at him, and some of them just disregard him and look away. Any of y'all say anything?Goodrich: Say, uh, get a little deep voice action going for Raz'ul. Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Well, I've only been here for about five minutes.Ali (as Yashee): I thought this was where we were waiting. This is where it told us to wait, so. Spurrier: Randy just stares daggers at him.Goodrich: Right! [laughs]Kyle (as cocky guy): What's your problem, little guy?Kyle: And right as that's happening, there's a loud crack that pierces the air-[Loud crack sound effect]Kyle: -and a plume of smoke in the center of the group, and this letter falls from the air. Goodrich: I got it. It says ""S"" though. Is that for Spurrier?Kyle: You just keep opening it. No, it's-Ali: Who's Spurrier? (laughs)Kyle: It's probably for a certain school in the land.Goodrich: Okay, so I read it-Ali: For ""school?""[laughter]Kyle: No, not for school, for a certain school-Ali: [still laughing] Okay.Goodrich: So, I read this to myself. Did anyone see me catch it? Or-Kyle: Oh, no, yeah. It was pretty loud, pretty- Everybody kind of turned and looked and saw it fall to the ground.Goodrich: I still just read it to myself. It says-[Music begins playing as he reads the letter]Goodrich: ""Test one: Strike me with an A, or an, like when people make a plan, or when we are in harmony. At minimum, the voices three, what am I?"" So, that's- So, one more time, so we can all digest it-Kyle: Are you going to read it out loud to them, or are you still just reading it to yourself in your head? Because nobody else can hear it. Nobody else can see it.Goodrich: Right. Raz'ul just throws it back at the ground.Kyle: Okay, y'all see the dwarf in the area walk over and pick it up, and read it, and then just throw it on the ground.Spurrier: Say-Spurrier (as Randy): Hey, dwarf, what'd you see there?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Listen here, little halfling feller, I don't really care about what's on that. I just really came here to play my guitar, Axe, and, uh, learn how to shred, but uh-Kyle: Y'all noticed, as y'all are kind of conversing, everybody's starting to pool around y'all, and people are like, ""What does it say? What's on the card?""Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Little halfling, what's it say?Spurrier: Randy shall read it.Kyle: You take it.Goodrich: So what do you say?Spurrier: I'm looking at it, and you know, I feel like I've got it? But-Goodrich: [laughing] Are you saying this out loud? Spurrier: Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): I feel like I've got this, and it's just not worth sharing. I feel like someone else could really uh-Ali: I'm kind of standing behind you, towering over, like-Ali (as Yashee): Come on, read it out loud. Let's hear it!Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Read it out to all of us.Spurrier (as Randy): You think you're so tough, half-orc-Kyle (as the other bards): Read it out! Yeah, what does it say?Spurrier (as Randy): Here, half-orc, you just take it. Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, just give it to me. [Music begins playing again] ""Strike me with an A or an, like when two people make a plan, or when we are in harmony, at minimum, the voices three. What am I?"" Is this some kind of a joke?Kyle: Everybody's like, what is this? The really cocky guy from earlier's just like-Ali (as Yashee): It does say ""Test Number One,"" so-Kyle (as cocky guy): This is ridiculous-Goodrich: Raz'ul just kind of looks up at the sky and says-[As Raz'ul speaks, the music begins again]Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Hm. Voices three, huh? Maybe some sort of triad, or triadic-Ali (as Yashee): It does say harmony-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): A chord, maybe?Kyle: Okay, as soon as you finish saying that word, you start to hear music fill the air-[Majestic orchestral music plays as Kyle describes the scene]Kyle: -and it slowly just pours in. And as this music starts to fill your ears, you actually start to see the waves of the music filling the air as well. As these waves completely fill your vision, they begin to take shape, forming into a large hall. The floors, the walls, the ceiling all around you are the first thing to appear. Then, you can see banners lining the wall, each of them unfurling and bearing their own instrument, and at the tip of them bearing a monogrammed ""S"" at the bottom. You are now standing in the main foyer of Strumlott's.Goodrich: Oh, dang.Kyle: Behind you, there's a large double door- Uh, double door made of instruments that are fused- Good job, you did- You solved the riddle. A chord.Goodrich: Yeah. [laughs]Kyle: So you see the door behind you, and it's made of instruments that are fused together to form one solid piece. So you see trumpets fused to clarinets, bassoons fused to baritones. Each instrument layered in such a way that you can't see through the door. It is a solid door. At the other end of the foyer is a small double door which, as you notice this, starts to creak open. An older woman- A human woman walks in. She's wearing large, thick square glasses and has slightly disheveled brown frizzy hair. Despite this, she carries herself with confidence, and when she speaks, she says, ""New class, please come this way for advising."" and walks back through the door, and, you know, kind of gesturing y'all to follow her as she walks back through.Goodrich: Alright. Raz'ul kind of follows.Spurrier: Yeah. As I walk by, I say-Spurrier (as Randy): Nicely done, dwarf. You solved the puzzle.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Oh, well, thank you.Kyle: Everyone's kind of clapping your back like, yeah, you figured it out pretty well. That's good stuff.Goodrich: Raz'ul's feeling pretty good. Alright, yeah. Kyle: Good- Good first impression.Goodrich: Thanks everybody.Kyle: You head down the hallway, and you get to the point where's there's the double doors, but there's a small alcove to the right of the doors, and you notice that there's- That in this alcove, there's a display. You see a bust of a halfling with a large grin on his face, and next to this bust is an interesting display that contains a very, very old looking lute. It only has a couple strings left on it. There's like a hole in it, but carved near the sound hold on the lute is ""B.S."" so, BS. There's an obvious barrier around the display. It shimmers with like a rainbow kind of hue, so just surrounds it, but under the bust of this halfling, there is a plaque. Nobody- Everybody else just kind of looks at it and walks through. Do any of y'all take a moment to read it? What do y'all want to do?Spurrier: Randy goes on over and says-Spurrier (as Randy): Ummm, hey! Half-orc. Dwarf. You guys interested in this little plaque here? It's pretty nice.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah. You must be especially interested. It's a halfling, like you. Who is this guy? What's it say?Ali: You're already down there. What is uh- What have you got then?Spurrier (as Randy): So there's a little bit of a glare in my eye.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Oh right, there's a glare. [laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): It's the angle. It's the height that I'm at.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Mrs. Uh, I guess- Goodrich: Can we tell you're a half-orc? I guess.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: I'm pretty tall and pretty orcy looking.Kyle: I think she stands like three feet taller than y'all.Ali: Yeah, I'm up here in the clouds.Spurrier: So I kind of like, yeah, so I kind of yank on your tunic, or whatever you're wearing.Ali (as Yashee): What's up little guy?Spurrier (as Randy): Ma'am, could you read it for us please?Ali (as Yashee): Way down there? Uh-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): We've both got glares kind of in both of our eyes. You know how it goes.Ali (as Yashee): Okay.Ali: So I get way down, like, on my hands and knees-Goodrich: And you're still taller than us.[laughter]Kyle: And you don't see the glare that they're talking about, you-Ali: Right.Kyle: You can read it fine. Goodrich: I'm just disinterested. I just like don't really care, I guess, about this-Ali: Well, I'm reading.Kyle: Are you reading this out loud or to yourself?Ali: I'll read it to my- Out loud.Kyle: Well yeah. So you read the plaque. It says, ""This is our best guess as to what Barenthall Strumlott looked like based off the limited historical documents that were written about him after the Age of Dissonance. Barenthall was one of the few responsible for ending the terrors of that age through the banishment of Gregor Casmort, leader of the cult that nearly brought the world to its knees. Barenthall spent the rest of his days attempting to collect what little traces of written history and knowledge was left, and despite the limited findings, he never seized his efforts-""Ali: This is a really long plaque. Goodrich: I know, jeez. How long is this plaque? Ali: Gonna, keep on going. Gonna finish it up.Kyle: ""-the whereabouts of his resting place are unknown. The last document found in relation to Barenthall says that he headed North to the Terrapin Isles and was never heard from again. To the left is the only artifact of Barenthall's the college has been able to obtain. The college has the efforts of the Bureau of Arcanic Regulation to thank for bringing this artifact to us as a gift to our fair school.""Goodrich: So, I'm going to say like, Raz'ul's kind of eyeing that lute because I've got my axe, right, my little guitar axe? He's kind of like, you know, okay, I see.Ali: I get off my hands and knees, and I'm like, that was a nice little history lesson. I'm gonna go get in line for the advisor. That was cute.Goodrich: Yeah, I'm with you. That was swell, but I'm bored.Kyle: Alright, so you continue through the double doors, and you enter into this square room. [Jaunty piano music beings playing] There's three other doors other than the one you entered through. The door on the left has a sign above it that says ""Residence Hall/Rehearsal Spaces,"" the door in front of you says ""Dormitories, Commissary, and Cafe,"" and the door to the right says ""Advising Offices and Storage."" By the time y'all get in there, everybody's already taken a seat in the chairs that line the room. From the door to the right, the same lady walks through, and she has a stack of forms in her hand. She begins handing them out. As she hands them out, she says-Kyle (as woman): Welcome to Strumlott's. I'm your advisor, Brenda McDade. Please fill these out and hand them back in, and afterwards I will escort you to Residence Hall for grouping.Kyle: So she all hands you one. Y'all three are still standing up. She walks up, she's like- Kyle (as Brenda): Please have a seat and, uh, you know, fill these out. And we'll get y'all squared away.Goodrich: Which is super funny because like, Spurrier and I are really short, and Ali is really huge in the same size chairs.[laughter]Kyle: Well, yeah. She like squats to- Oh, yeah, yeah, sitting in the chairs, like-Ali: I squeeze in there, like, ugh-Kyle: Y'all like jump up a little bit to get into it-Spurrier: Our feet are dangling.Goodrich: We have to climb up the side of the chair.Kyle: Make a climb check. Or an athletics check-Ali: A sitting check.Goodrich: I got a three.Spurrier: Oh man you did not get up that chair at all-Goodrich: I sure did not-Kyle: You actually-Goodrich: I'm going to just fall over on my-Spurrier: I got a three as well.Ali: I pick both of em up and just like stick them in the chair, like, here you go guys.Kyle: Let me paint this scene real quick. Okay. So y'all to go sit in the three remaining chairs, and like, Yashee, you just sit down, and Randy and Raz'ul, you'll kind of like jump up to scoot in, but your butts hit the edge of the chair-[laughter]Kyle: -and you just slide right off, and like, land on your keister, and then at that point, Yashee kind of like, picks y'all up and puts you in your chairs.Goodrich: Aw, yeah. Nice.Ali: Hey boys.Kyle: There's a small chuckle in the room. Everyone is kind of laughing.Spurrier: I'm kind of grumbling like, “Eh just pick me up again.” [grumbling]Goodrich: Randy crushes it into a ball deep into his soul to save for later.[laughter]Kyle: But yeah, so everybody- You know, y'all are all filling out the forms, and everything like that, and getting through it.Spurrier: So, is everyone currently busy filling out their form?Kyle: Yeah, after a good chuckle of seeing two people fall on their butts, they- they- you know, everybody gets back into their own form. Filling it out.Spurrier: And is Brenda up at the front?Kyle: No, she's walked back through the advising door, you know, saying, I'll be back in, you know, she's taking about five minutes or so.Spurrier: Okay. I'm gonna do a stealth to see if I can stealth my way into her office to, uh-Kyle: Oh, you're gonna try to sneak in? Okay, yeah. By all means go right ahead.Goodrich: It's more of like a cool check, you know what I mean? You know where you're going, and-Spurrier: Well, I don't want the other students to notice me-Goodrich: A confidence check.Spurrier: Oh, that's a twenty-five.Goodrich: Ooh.Kyle: Oh, I rolled for the group, and everybody's super into filling out their forms. Raz'ul, Yashee, what are y'all gonna do? Are y'all gonna try to perceive, or are y'all in your form? What's going on?Goodrich: No, I'm into- I'm into my form.Ali: I see him hop up, but I don't pay much attention to it.Goodrich: After all the time I spent in the forest, I-Kyle: If you want to actually see him hop up, like your natural perception? Like, there's a thing called passive perception, which is just like I walk into a room, and I see a couch, a TV, and like, you know, but if you want to be on that, you would have to roll a perception roll. So what did you roll again, Randy?Spurrier: A twenty-five.Kyle: Yeah, so you need to roll a perception roll if you don't- if you don't meet or beat a twenty-five, you won't see.Ali: Like, I don't even notice he gets up? He's right next to me.Kyle: Yeah, he's super stealthy.Spurrier: I'm Randy.Goodrich: I straight up can't beat a twenty-five, so.Kyle: Yeah. The only thing that would beat would be a natural twenty, if you can't-Ali: Uh. It's a fourteen, so.Kyle: Yeah, no, you- You're involved in your thing too. You're kinda reading through it.Ali: Gotcha.Spurrier: I'm sneaking-Kyle: Yeah, you sneak on. You make it through the room- make it through the doorway. Nobody notices. You see a hallway of like, you know, doors to the left and the right. They kind of have windows in them. You know, typical teacher office areas that you can see into, and people are working and papers and everything. And you see Brenda McDade walk down to her office. It's the third one on the right, and she walks in. What are you gonna do at this point?Spurrier: I go up to her and I say, um-Spurrier (as Randy): Excuse me, Brenda-Kyle: Okay, so you walk up behind her and you kind of like, tug at her- tug at her skirt and everything-[laughter]Kyle: She turns around, and like, looks down-Goodrich: There's a lot of skirt-tugging.Kyle: She's like, ""Oh, um,"" and she like, flips through some things.Kyle (as Brenda): Are you- uh, Randall?Spurrier (as Randy): Randy.Kyle (as Brenda): Oh, I'm sorry.Spurrier (as Randy): That's alright.Kyle (as Brenda): Okay, what can I help you with? Are you- Do you have a question about the form?Spurrier (as Randy): When it comes to filling out the form, uh, is Fantasy Pictionary something that you're very well versed in?""Kyle (as Brenda): Oh, I've not played Pictionary in a long time. The last time it was with my family. Um, I've played the game before, but if you could f-Goodrich: Does she kind of like, take a long pause after that? After saying the last time with her family? She kind of looks up at the ceiling, and…Kyle: She's like, reminiscing? About like-Goodrich: Like, trails off a little bit?Kyle: ""Oh, my family."" Yeah, she works way too often. You can kind of tell. Like, little time.Spurrier: Poor Brenda.Kyle: Yeah, she puts in some hard hours. She's like-Kyle (as Brenda): Well, uh, are you needing some help filling out the form? What's-Spurrier (as Randy): Well if uh, if pictures will suffice, then uh, that would be our best form, for this form. Otherwise, we may, uh, need some assistance.Kyle (as Brenda): Uh, I would gladly provide you assistance. Cause reading would be much easier.[Goodrich laughing]Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, alright.Kyle (as Brenda): Um, do you need me transcribe, I guess?Spurrier (as Randy): A dictation would be wonderful.Kyle: Okay. Okay. Well she-Spurrier (as Randy): Most appreciated.Kyle: She invites you into her office-Goodrich: She doesn't skip her beat.[laughter]Kyle: She doesn't, no, pretty much I'll have a conversation about everything she has on the form. So, y'all fill out all that information, and-Goodrich: Maybe it's that illiteracy is something that is rampant around Beetzart. I mean, who knows. So. Kyle: We'll have to get out into the world to find out.Spurrier: Should I see if I can sneak back without-Kyle: Yeah, by all means. You finish up, and it doesn't take too long because she knows everything like, as far as, what exactly to ask and how to phrase it. What did you get?Spurrier: This time a nineteen.Kyle: Okay. This time you walk back through, and Brenda actually follows you, and she's got a large stack of books with her. She walks back through with you, and everybody kind of looks up because they're done, so. Everybody notices you walk back in with her. I- I'm gonna say that y'all notice because, you know, y'all have finished it up by the time so you're kind of just waiting for Brenda to return.Goodrich: Well, I say-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Well, that was nice, helping her get her books. Way to go, little guy.Spurrier (as Randy): I do what I can.Kyle: Yeah, you hear somebody say, “Brown noser."" [laughter]Kyle: But, uh... But yeah, so she comes back in, and she sets the books down on this table. She asks-Kyle (as Brenda): Has everybody completed their packets?Kyle: And majority of the room says, yes, yes all around.[Players say yes]Kyle: She goes around and collects them, and says-Kyle (as Brenda): I'm going to dole out your journals now. As part of the school, you're required to keep a record of the events that happen in your travels and as you're working for the school and learning. We take this information and as you- We compile it into your group history. So we take each person's, you know, own experiences, and just compile that into one of those nice little square blurbs you see in history books. But, please take these books and fill them out. You fill them out on your travels.Ali (as Yashee): Ohh. Okay, that makes sense.Kyle: And she goes around. She doles out like, just journals, they're basically journals that she's handing out. They all kind of look the same. So, she's like-Kyle (as Brenda): You can turn these in here, or at any of the campuses around the- around the country, so uh, but by all means go ahead and gather your things and follow me. We'll be taking you to Resident Hall where you'll be grouped.Kyle: So everybody picks up their stuff, and uh-Goodrich: Sorting hat situation.Kyle: Yeah, yeah. So y'all all- She leads you down a long hallway. The door to the left that leads to Resident Hall- Sorry, it actually curves to the right as you're walking down it, and you can see pictures of different bards here and there. There's no like, name labels, but it's just. You know. Fancy looking bards that are honorary in the school. But y'all are walking down this hall. Eventually it leads to a main door ahead of you, and then there's a door to the right, and it's like stage entrances. And different levels of entrances into this hall. But she takes you to the main entrance and opens this door. The room is uncommonly pitch black, except for a large spotlight and a circle in the center of the room. She says-Kyle (as Brenda): Please move to the spotlight. And we will begin shortly.Goodrich: I say, I raise my hand, and I say-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): You mean all of us? All of us go to the spotlight?Ali: Squeeze in there-Goodrich: I'm just getting kind of nervous, you know, as you do when you're about to get, like-Kyle: Spotlit?Goodrich: Right.Kyle: When the spotlight's on you, you get nervous? Is that what you're saying?Goodrich: Yeah, yeah that. Yes.Kyle: That's very unbecoming of bards.Goodrich: Well, you know- Fine. Right. My bad.Kyle (as Brenda): Yes, be prepared to be in the spotlight. I- I'm the advisor. I'm not your teacher. I have not earned that. I'm just. Mm.Goodrich: Again, she looks off to the ceiling. [laughing]Kyle: Yeah, she's kind of just like, ""Ah, dammit.""Goodrich: Spacing out.Kyle: Yeah, but she's like please proceed, and everyone else just walks through. The nine other people that are with y'all walk through, and you can hear them all rambling, talking to each other, and everything about the information that they asked for. Y'all are made to wait for about five minutes before you hear this very gentle kind of voice, [music begins playing] but very loud. It fills the room, and you hear this voice say-Kyle (as the voice): Thank you for patience. It was difficult deciding what note class to put each of you in. Considering all the different talents and abilities here, each note class has been carefully picked so that each person in that class will benefit from the other two's fortes and shortcomings.Ali: Heh heh. Forte. See what you did there.Kyle: Ah, yeah.Goodrich: A bunch of the other kids laugh when she says shortcomings.Kyle (as the voice): I hear you laughing down there, and I'm sure you get the joke.[laughter]Kyle (as the voice): We'll get this done quickly so you can meet your teachers. I will call your group, then the people in your group. Group C, we have Tabitha Wright, Garreth North, Ilda Glintrock. Your teacher is going to be Christina Blackblade. Group B, we have Horace First, Nernla Stormtree, Areneth Jadebranch. Your teacher is John Brickswinger. Group B Flat-Goodrich: [snickers] B Flat!Kyle (as the voice): -Tom Lennon, Pimble Glitterstone, Sam Lasseter. Your teacher is Vera Diamond. Group A, Yashee Bordun, Randall Greentrees, Raz'ul son of Daz’ul.Kyle: You hear some people kind of murmur when your full name is said.Kyle (as the voice): Your teacher will be Symbol.Kyle: At that point you hear a larger murmur rise out of the group. You also hear some murmur coming out of the surrounding area that's blacked out that you can't see in. She finally says-Kyle (as the voice): New students, I'd like to welcome you to Strumlott's. Let me officially introduce you to your teachers. Please, teachers come down.Kyle: The lights come up, and you can actually see that you're in a large, of course it's the Residence Hall, so it's a large performance hall, but everything is centered around the circle. There's students in there, and everyone stands up and is just like respectfully clapping.Goodrich: Oh dang, nice.Kyle: There's these four ways that people can walk in from an offstage way straight to the center. There's only three teachers that walk up, and the three teachers address the other group. Y'all are just left alone for a moment. You hear the voice from before just say, ""Where is Symbol?"" and you hear some whispering and what not. And-Spurrier: What was it? Symbol?Kyle: Symbol, yeah.Spurrier: Symbol, okay.Kyle: Symbol is your teacher's name.Ali: Symbooll.Goodrich: Symbol.Kyle: You hear-Kyle (as the voice): Group A, I apologize. This is very unbecoming of our teachers. Symbol must have been running late from his recent errand.Goodrich: Nice.Kyle (as the voice): Please just follow the ramp up to where he would have come from.Kyle: You can see that ramp lit up, so there's arrows you follow and everything.Spurrier: And we're Group A.Kyle: Yeah, and you're Group A.Spurrier: This is our- Okay.Kyle: Yeah, so she's like-Kyle (as the voice): Group A please proceed to this room, and we will try to locate Symbol and have him be here as quick as possible. We apologize. We thought he was here already.Goodrich: I kind of nudge Randy, and I'm like, ""Get a load of this guy. Not even here. Maybe I should've stayed in the forest.""Kyle: Not a very good first impression is it?Ali: I mean, he's got like one name. Those kind of people. Always a little full of themselves. I think.Goodrich: Ho hoh! Shots fired! Okay.Kyle: Everybody starts to disperse after that. You can see all of the other students that are in the hall breaking off with their teachers and going back up the paths that the teachers came from as well. Just to have their own little meeting. Y'all walk up that pathway. Y'all are made to wait a little while. It's like another ten minutes, and there's a single door on the other side of this room that you're waiting on. After the ten minutes or so, the door actually opens, and a man of medium height walks in, and he's eating a pudding cup. He walks up to y'all. He just kind of saunters in, eating his pudding cup really quietly. He's wearing leather armor with a purple crushed velvet renaissance style hat. He spends a couple minutes just finishing his pudding and eyeing you all down, and as he takes his pudding-Goodrich: Raz'ul says-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah, take your time, please. It's not like this is an important day for the rest of us. Enjoy your pudding.""Kyle: He's about to take the last bite, and he looks at you and puts the spoon in his mouth, and finally he's like-Kyle (as Symbol): [deep breath] Raz'ul you need new strings.Kyle: He turns around and waves his hand in a dismissive manner, and starts to walk out the door.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): ""Whoah, hey hey. New strings? What are you talking about?Kyle (as Symbol): Um, well-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): My strings are fine, see? [plays a few out of tune guitar chords] Oh-Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, that's not fine at all actually. That's like I was saying. You need some new strings.Goodrich: I want to point out that like, that was kind of. I really meant to play something, but the guitar almost took my hand and made it slip, and I'm like freaking out now because I'm like, whoah that never happens. He thinks, ""What, that was weird.""Ali: Yashee's thinking like, ""Oh great.""Kyle: I told you.Goodrich: Yeah, you guys like. Look at this scrub. Can't even play his instrument.Ali: In the group with the guy who can't even play his instrument.Kyle (as Symbol): To answer your question further about why you need new strings, that was mere talent, but- or lack thereof, but the real reason you need strings is we all know that music is a powerful element, and as you should know by now, the vibrations we make go into this world and can affect things emotionally, mentally, physically. Your strings are great for this plane but lack the ability to reverberate through the ethereal plane. This keeps me from teaching you all that I know. So, please, go out and get new strings. I hope to see all of you return.Kyle: He makes a reference to somebody really tall, and he turns around and begins to walk out the door again.Goodrich: But- But wait, where do we get strings? Is there a fantasy Guitar Center? I guess I would ask-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Where do I get my strings?Kyle: Well, he's still walking, so he's basically forcing y'all to have to walk with him to keep up and continue this conversation.Goodrich: Ohhhh, I thought he was just leaving us. Okay.Kyle: No, no. He's just walking away-Goodrich: So we're just following him. Gotcha.Kyle:  -and if y'all want to keep actually asking him questions you're gonna have to follow him.Goodrich: Okay. I follow, and I'm like-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yo, hey, Prof, where do I get these strings from? Cause, I feel like these strings were pretty good until I just played just then. That was weird, but. Yeah. Where do I find crazy-Kyle (as Symbol): You can call me Symbol.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): O-okay.Kyle (as Symbol): That is my name.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Symbol.Ali (as Yashee): Like, Mr. Symbol? Or just-Kyle (as Symbol): No.Spurrier(as Randy): Dr. Symbol?Kyle (as Symbol): No. Just Symbol.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Couldn't get that doctorate, huh.Kyle (as Symbol): That's not what this is about.Ali (as Yashee): Is that a one word, like, Symbol, or is it like Sym Ball?Spurrier (as Randy): DJ Symbol?Goodrich: [laughing] DJ Symbol.Kyle (as Symbol): [sighing] No. It's just Symbol.Ali (as Yashee): Just Symbol. I just want to make sure it's right.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, do we need to modify it with crash or ride or-Kyle (as Symbol): Nope.Spurrier (as Randy): -china?Kyle (as Symbol): No. No, not that kind of cymbal.Spurrier (as Randy): Splash?Kyle (as Symbol): No. Damn it. Damn it!Spurrier (as Randy): Ooh, I like Splash Cymbal though.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): That's good.Spurrier (as Randy): Let's call him Splash Cymbal.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): I'm gonna call him Splash Cymbal with you.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Why did I take this job? Why did I take this job?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Hey, Splash. Where do we get the strings?Ali: [laughing] Splash.Kyle (as Symbol): [pained] I'm about to relinquish my ... my position at this school already.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): But first, strings. Where do I get them?Kyle (as Symbol): To the point! Thank you. Ah. Well, perhaps the town of Lakeridge has a tale or two. They could lead you to something that is a better quality of string. Of course, you know, you can buy strings anywhere, but you need a certain type of string. [starts singing] So perhaps you could grab a pint and grab a stool. Drink the former whole. You can eat, and you can duel at Durden's Punchbowl.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Oh. Hey. What's up with that?Kyle: And then begins to walk around, and he actually makes a corner- Like as he's walking around the corner, he's kinda whistling the tune, [whistling] and kind of disappears around the corner.Goodrich: Can we still follow?Kyle: You can.Goodrich: I follow. That's what I say to you guys. [laughs] I turn around and say-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): I follow.Kyle: Does anybody else follow after him?Ali: Sure.Spurrier: Yeah.Ali: I want to see where this train goes.Kyle: Okay, so you follow him around the corner, and you hear the whistling [whistling returns], and you see Symbol from the back, but as you approach him- You walk around him. He's stopped. So you walk around and you realize it's actually just like a fake statue. He's left a replica of himself in that position, and you can still hear the whistling. It's just a fake version of him.Goodrich: Ah Vampir![laughter]Kyle: Anyway, so, at this point, y'all are left with that information of Durden’s Punchbowl and Lakeridge, and your teacher has left you already.Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, Splash.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): This guy straight sucks. All I want to know is where to buy strings, and I guess we're going to the Punchbowl.Ali (as Yashee): Should be an interesting semester.Spurrier: Do we already know about this town? Does this mean anything to us? Do we know anything about the world-Kyle: Yeah. Y'all know where Lakeridge is. Lakeridge was one of the cities that you came through to get to Strumlott’s. It was the road that led out of- You left from Lakeridge to Strumlott’s, so it's just the town North of where you're at.Spurrier: Cool.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Well, I mean, guys, I don't know if you want to come with me. If you guys, you know, gotta go set your dorm room up. Put the posters on your wall, and see about joining a frat or sorority, but Im gonna go head over to this, you know, the Punchbowl and see about these strings. If you guys wanna come, cool. I mean, I guess we should start get to know each other because we're gonna be-Ali (as Yashee): Teamin' up.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): It sounds like we're gonna be in a team.Spurrier (as Randy): In a team.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): But, you know. It's whatever you guys wanna do. So.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, I'm willing to check it out. Maybe they've got some sweet percussion I can add to my set up.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): I've got nothing better to do.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): That makes me feel great. Okay.Kyle: Everybody give me a perception check real quick.Ali: I've got nineteen.Goodrich: Ooh, that's a natural twent, Kyle.Spurrier: Wow. I got twelve.Goodrich: So, for me that would be a twenty four.Kyle: Y'all are kind of talking about this, and you didn't really check out- You just try to talk to this statuesque version of your teacher, and you didn't notice there was a little sack hanging under his coat.[laughter]Goodrich: What, Kyle-Kyle: Yeah, under his flap- no. It's got a sack, and it just says, if you need me, use these.Ali: But we didn't see that.Kyle: You didn't see it at first.Spurrier: Now we see it. Now we see the sack, and it all becomes clear.Ali (as Yashee): Whoah, what's that sack right there? Do you see that guys?Kyle: It's big.Spurrier (as Randy) Big sack.Ali (as Yashee): It's probably the biggest sack-Goodrich: Someone just grab it already. Just grab it.Kyle: Who's gonna grab that sack?Spurrier: Randy.Kyle: Okay, so you grab that sack, and there's a tinkling-Spurrier: I could reach way up-[laughter]Kyle: -there's a tinkling of glass inside when you reach it, and it feels like there's three glass cylinders inside there. You open it up, and there's a note in there, and it says, ""Whisper into these soft messages, and speak the name of the person you wish to contact. If they have one of these, they'll be able to hear you. This is the ira glass.""Spurrier: Nice. So, I take mine, put it up to my mouth, and I say-Spurrier (as Randy): Hey, Splash.Kyle: You don't hear anything come back.Spurrier (as Randy): [whispering] Splaash. Hey Splash.Kyle: Give me an intelligence roll.Goodrich: Did you hand us one too? Or did you just take one?Spurrier: No, I just took one.Kyle: Yeah, there is three. Y'all each have one.Goodrich: Okay. Gotcha.Spurrier: Intelligence. That would be an eleven.Kyle: You start to try to say this and you're like, wait, that's not his name.Spurrier: Well. I just leave it be then. I stow it away. So what are these called?Kyle: They're called the Ira Glass.Spurrier: Ira Glass. Right.Kyle: You speak a soft message to a person.Spurrier (as Randy): Speak the name. Splash. He's gonna respond.Goodrich: So we have to speak-Kyle: Not under that name.Goodrich: So we have to speak their name first.Kyle: Yeah, you have to say their name, then say the message you want to whisper to 'em. Remember, you've got to speak softly, and have a good time.Spurrier (as Randy): Hey. Hey there boy.Kyle: [quietly] I want you to know in about two minutes a dragon's gonna walk around the corner. Cause that's the Ira Glass.[laughter]Kyle: So yeah.Goodrich: I'm gonna go ahead and whisper into mine-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Hey, uh, Symbol? Symbol, are you there? Over. Chh.Kyle (as Symbol): Already? What?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah, um. Thanks.Kyle: You don't hear anything.Spurrier (as Randy): Can you ask him if he will respond to Splash?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Also, would you respond to Splash for us please?Kyle (as Symbol): Never.Spurrier (as Randy): It would be a good codename.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): It's good bonding. It's usually good to having nicknames for each other.Kyle (as Symbol): Uh, we're not there yet, but I like the sentiment.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Roger.Kyle (as Symbol): Give it time.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Raz'ul Out. Chh.Kyle (as Symbol): What was that sound?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Over, I guess, sorry.Kyle (as Symbol): What was that chh sound?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Nothing! Over and out.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. Bye bye.Goodrich: Okay. So, I guess now we're heading over to, what was it called?Ali: Durden's Punchbowl.Kyle: Y'all are pretty much- Yeah, this is more or less the first thing that your teacher is telling you to do as part of tutoring and-Ali: We're on a mission.Kyle: -everything like that. So he's already sending y'all out. It's about a half day's travel to Lakeridge. Y'all get there close to around night time. Around dusk. You arrive in Lakeridge, which is a smaller village. There's not any kind of wall around it. Just kind of open to any potential attack.Goodrich: But quaint.Kyle: Small farms dot the main road once you get closer to the town. Most of the building are stone walls with thatched roofs. There's militia around and a typical town guard and everything. The town guard- You can kind of ask him, ""Oh, you know, where's Durden? I was here recently and trying to remember where this place is,” and he points you down the road to where Durden's Punchbowl is. There's a couple of other places in the town that y'all remember coming through here earlier. There's Larry's Leathers, which you can get leather armor and goods if you need them. Magical E-Day, which is a place that basically, if there's something magical that you need to sell, and you can't find a place to sell it, you can take it there.Goodrich: What was it called, Kyle?Kyle: Magical E-Day.Goodrich: [laughing] Okay.Kyle: And then there's Gernmaw's Soup House, which is a homeless house, and then there's also another store called ""Need Something Sharp,"" and you can buy simple weapons and-Ali: Pointy things.Goodrich: Is the logo like a sharp symbol?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: A hashtag for the layman, I guess? Just weird-Kyle: Or a pound.Goodrich: Right, or a pound.Kyle: Depending on, you know, where you come from and what you're into. Alright, but yeah. Do y'all want to head straight to Durden's? Is there anything y'all want to check out? Any questions y'all have for the guard that y'all talked to?Spurrier (as Randy): Say, hey, do you know anything about this Symbol guy?Kyle: Oh, and he's like-Kyle (as Guard): Oh, Symbol? Yeah, absolutely. He's one of the most fantastic performers in the land.Spurrier (as Randy): What's he play?Kyle (as Guard): You name it. It's just all over the place.Goodrich: He's like a Todd Rundgren.Kyle (as Guard): He's been touring for a long time, and I heard recently he's decided to take a backseat to the hard life of traveling and teach down at Strumlott’s. Perhaps, y'all maybe know that already.Kyle: And he eyes y'all and sees your instruments and everything like that. And he's like-Kyle (as Guard): But perhaps you're here to take care of your first gig?Ali (as Yashee): Perhaps.Spurrier (as Randy): Perhaps.Kyle (as Guard): Y'all look a little. You know. Fresh behind the gills, so.Goodrich: Green behind the gills?Kyle: Is it green behind the gills?Goodrich: I think so.Kyle: I don't know.Goodrich: I like fresh too.Kyle: I like 'em fresh because I want it fresh. I don't like spoiled fish. I like it fresh behind the gills.Goodrich: Yeah, right, yeah.Kyle: Alright, so, y'all make your way over to Durden's. You enter into Durden's Punchbowl and the smell of beer-soaked wood and cooked meats just enters your nose as soon as you open the door. As far as patrons go, there are three at the bar. There's a family of four sharing a table, like it's a human mom, dad, and two daughters.Goodrich: All with giant pints of beer.Kyle: Yeah, even the daughters. They have bigger pints than their dad, and then there's two people sitting at a little table by themselves. It's a human and a half-elf, and they're having a conversation. Then there's a lone half-elf standing in a corner with a list- Looks like he's checking things off. The three at the bar, you actually recognize them. You recognize two of them as being other students that were with y'all earlier, and you also notice the very contemptuous guy that arrived and was like ""What is this, a joke?""Goodrich: Right, yeah.Kyle: That was-Goodrich: That clown.Kyle: Y'all learned really quick that that is Garreth North. You heard him talking at a certain point. We'll just go ahead and retcon that. You walk in and Garreth is obviously upset. The two that are with him is- accompanied with him is a gnome and a half-elf. As they're standing there, Garreth is at ends with the bartender. Talking about like, ""Oh, come on, you wouldn't want to have this kind of talent in your place? Bringing in more business, more money."" and the bartender's just like, ""Not with that attitude, man, you need to check yourself, cause like, that's not how you go about things."" He's kind of gesturing to the other dudes like, ""I can't- Can you believe this, Ilda?"" and Ilda slinks away, already looking kind of like ""Oh, geez,"" and Tabitha pulls this thing where she lifts up her shirt hides her nose and laughs a little bit. So, she's chuckling under the shirt, and Garreth looks at her and shoots her a look.Spurrier: Wait, did you name him Garreth because it's kind of like Gary from Poke'mon?Kyle: Yeah.[laughter]Kyle: In fact, I have it written-Goodrich: I hate him even more now.Kyle: I had it written in here that basically, he's going to be the Gary to our Ash. The Johnny Lawrence to our Daniel Sun. So yeah.Goodrich: Excellent.Spurrier: The Draco to our Harry.[laughter]Kyle: Yeah. Pretty- More or less. He is the dick kid in school. So-Goodrich: Right. Is he underage or something? And he's like throwing a stink or something? What's the drinking age in this town?Kyle: Let’s see how old he is. He’s eighteen. I mean, there’s girls drinking-Spurrier: Girls trying to get wolfed up. Does Garreth have a glass? Is he drinking anything?Kyle: No- He doesn't have- They don't have drinks. It looks like they're just standing there like conversing with the bartender.Spurrier: Is there a glass that's close by him?Kyle: Yeah, there's an old mug that was unattended.Spurrier: Okay. Is the barkeep currently looking at Garreth, or is he off doing stuff?Kyle: Yeah, he's engaged with Garreth. They're having this conversation when y'all walk in.Spurrier: Okay. Then, I turn over to Raz'ul. I say-Spurrier (as Randy): You gonna go up and talk to the barkeep? Talk to that tavern feller?Goodrich: Okay, so I look back at Randy, and I say-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Hey, I’ve got an even better idea.Goodrich: I want to cast Minor Illusion. So to do so, I take my axe off my back, take Usumthin-Kyle: Okay?Goodrich: I bring it down, and I do-[Guitar plays]Goodrich: So, uh-Kyle: Are you making an illusion of somebody under eighteen?Goodrich: No- [laughs] Yeah. So, what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna create an image of an object that's no larger than a five foot cube. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna draw a straight up five foot cube- You know how in Pulp Fiction when she draws that square, and she's like, 'Don't be a-' and she draws the square? I'm gonna draw that square above his head, and I'm gonna draw little arrows, marquee-style with blinking lights that point down to him.Kyle: Okay, okay, okay.Goodrich: And so then I'm trying to get everyone to laugh and like-Kyle: Alright alright alright. Um, let’s see. [Rolling dice] That's the bartender, that is the family, that is the pair, that's the single, and- Okay. So the bartender, the family, and his  partners notice this thing, and they look at it and they're just kind of like, they get it. They're starting to chuckle and everything. They're laughing. He's like looking around, likeKyle (as Garreth): Why is everybody starting to laugh? What's so funny here?Kyle: And he notices that people are looking up, and he looks up. And he's just like, ""What the-"" and he starts to wave it out, and then he realizes that it's an illusion.Goodrich: Then I call out to him, and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul):  Hey, buddy, you got something on your shirt?Goodrich: And then I turn that energy ball into a finger, and I point to his chest with it.Kyle: Uh huh.Goodrich: Does he look down? To see if there's something on his shirt?Kyle: No. He looks pretty miffed.Goodrich: Can you just have him look down?Kyle: I roll for it, and he's not interested.Goodrich: Aaaahah. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, for real! It's really bad on your shirt.Kyle: Roll me a deception.Goodrich: Okay. [rolls dice] Six.Kyle: Uh oh.Goodrich: Well, actually, ten, cause I'm proficient-Kyle: -and I rolled a ten.Goodrich: You’ve got to let me have this Kyle.Kyle: It's not me! It's the dice. It's the dice doing it, I promise.Ali: I pick up a glass, and toss it Garreth's feet.Kyle: Toss it, okay. Roll me a ranged attack.Ali: Oh, I'm not attacking him. I’m hitting him- I’m hitting it before- I throw it, and just-Kyle: I gotta see how it rolls ya through. I gotta see how it rolls ya through.Goodrich: Just roll for him.Ali: Just a twenty?Goodrich: Walk into a bar.Kyle: Yeah, just a twenty-sided dice. Add your dexterity, cause it's an-Ali: Eighteen.Kyle: Okay. So, you try to roll a glass after he's waved this thing away, and you throw the glass, and you're trying to hit his feet.Ali: I'm trying to hit right in front of his feet.Kyle: Yeah, you accidentally hit his ankles. You just did really well. Well, actually, no, if you did really well- You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. We’ll-Ali: I'm not trying to hurt him. I'm trying to make him look at his feet.Kyle: You get it right in front of his feet, and you do it so well that glass breaks and lands on his shoes.Spurrier: Ohh.Kyle: Sweet new Keds.Goodrich: [laughing] Wears Keds.Kyle: Yeah. He does, but yeah. He finally looks down, and-Goodrich: Aw, yes! And Raz'ul's so happy that I flick that finger up into his face. It poofs into his eyes-Kyle: It kind of flips back, and he's like, ""What the- What the hell's going on?""Goodrich: Kyle, does everyone laugh?Kyle: Yeah, everybody's getting a good little chuckle out of this.Goodrich: Thank god.Kyle: Yeah, everybody's getting a good little chuckle out of it, and-Goodrich: Awesome. It's all I wanted.Kyle: So, Randy, what are you doing during this entire scene? What's your action here?Spurrier: So what's the barkeep-tender doing at this point?Kyle: He's having a jovial laugh at the expense of Garreth.Spurrier: At the expense of Garreth. Well, okay. For the moment, i'm just gonna hang out until this dies down. We'll see what comes of it next.Kyle: Alright. Garreth has started to look really flustered and frustrated, and he's just like-Kyle (as Garreth): That’s, that's it. Let's get out of here. Come on Ilda. Come on, uh, what's your name again?Kyle: And the half-elf kind of looks at him, and she looks super pissed, and she's really quietly, ""It's Tabitha."" So, he starts walking out, and he tries to pass Yashee, and tries to elbow her or shoulder her as he walks by but winds up only hitting your bicep, or like your elbow pit? So he does that, and give me a strength save, Ali.Ali: Nine.Kyle: Nine? Okay. Well, you definitely, just barely- You give a little bit as he brushes up against you, but he kind of elbows you, or shoulders you, and winds up bouncing back more so than he does moving you. And he goes, ""Ow. What the- A rock."" And keeps walking out, and you see Tabitha do the same shirt thing where she pulls it up over her nose and laughs.Ali: Now I kind of just go- [short laugh]Kyle: Tabitha walks behind. She sees you laughing. She puts up her hand for a high five.Goodrich: Alright.Spurrier: Has-Goodrich: Wait wait wait. What's Ali gonna do?Spurrier: Oh right. Sorry.Ali: Oh man. Like, I wanna high five her, but I don't know her.Spurrier: Do it. We need someone on the inside.Ali: I'll go for it. I’ll give her a little nod and a little side-Kyle: A little side style? Okay, she comes down. She meets you.Ali: I don't want to make it too like yeah! I want to be like, I got you girl.Goodrich: That’s good. That’s a good call.Kyle: Randy, at what point did you want to do your action?Spurrier: Has Garreth gone out the door yet?Kyle: He is headed towards the door. He has just passed Yashee who moved over to a table. He's a little farther out. I'm gonna say it's you and Raz'ul are still close to the entrance, and Yashee moved up into more of like the dining area where there was a glass available to grab.Spurrier: Alright.Kyle: Well, and Garreth is probably walking towards you.Spurrier: Cool, so I have my Mage Hand, that I'm gonna do. Since i have a little wizard living inside of me, I should probably just say, [distorted voice filter] Mage Hand! Except I just say it, to myself.Kyle: You just whisper it into your head. You like cough it.Spurrier: I'm going to basically make it act like a foot, and trip him.Kyle: So it’s like Mage Foot.Goodrich: Mage Foot. Maybe boot him out the door.Spurrier: Ooh, even better.Goodrich: Yeaah.Spurrier: Alright.Kyle: So are you gonna trip him, or are you gonna boot him out the door?Spurrier: I'm gonna boot him. That's a little more fun.Kyle: Okay, so what does this Mage Foot look like? I mean, any inspiration for this thing?Spurrier: Ohh, yeah, I need something, something. It's like, uh-Goodrich: Like the Monty Python foot?Spurrier: Ooh, Monty Python foot's good. Let's say it's the Monty Python foot mixed with like, it's got like cleats on it. Give him an extra little nudge out the door.Goodrich: I was gonna say maybe it had painted toenails or something, but.Spurrier: It could have that too, yeah.Goodrich: I, uh- Okay. Not to step on your toes-Spurrier: Ah!Goodrich: I was thinking maybe like it's the Monty Python foot, but like the toes painted, and on the toes is painted R A N D Y.Spurrier: Okay, that's good.Kyle: Yeah, that works well, yeah.Spurrier: I boot him.Kyle: Alright, so yeah, you can move about- Go ahead and give me a d20 attack roll, and add your spell modifier.Spurrier: And well- So I was gonna say, because I'm a rogue, I have a special version of Mage Hand that I can do stealth versions, so I wanted to be kind of sneaky and not noticed-Kyle: Oh, awesome.Spurrier: So it would be my sleight of hand versus perception.Kyle: Excellent, yeah, do it.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle: Let's roll on sleight of and.Spurrier: Randy! That is a fourteen.Kyle: Okay. I rolled a thirteen.Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: So, he has not noticed it. He gets booted, and it pretty much happens as he's walking in between you two. So he gets booted, and he's fallen to his knees in front of the door. He just gets up, and he turns around, and he's like-Kyle (as Garreth): I don't know who's doing this, but you're gonna rue the day that you messed with Garreth North. My father, my father's brother, my entire family will come after you, and I swear to god if this keeps happening after I walk out this door, I'll know it's you.[laughter]Goodrich: That's good. That's good.Spurrier: I take my little portable organ and- [organ music plays]Kyle: You play that and he shoots you a dirty look. He's just like, uhh, then turns and goes out the door.Spurrier: Then Randy rolls a natural twenty on a shit-eating grin.[laughter]Kyle: Nice, heck yeah. So they have gone out the door. That trio has left out, and the- everybody's kind of like, the laughter's dying down and everything. Y'all have made a good scene of him. A good example. And Bradward is- The bartender, sorry, you don't know his name yet, is kind of laughing, and he sees y'all, and he's likeKyle (as the bartender): Haha, man, well, sorry about the trouble with that guy! There are just a few newbies from Strumlott's trying to get their first gig. Typical first year kind of mission stuff-Goodrich: A bunch of noobs.Kyle: But uh-Goodrich: Hate those first years.Kyle: But now that I get a look at y'all, might y'all be doing the same?Goodrich: I just look down at my feet and say, “Yeah.""Kyle (as the bartender): Oh.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe not for the same reasons though, you know. We’re definitely first years, but-Kyle (as the bartender): Oh, for the right reasons, then?Ali (as Yashee): We're here only for the right reasons.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): We're all about the music.Kyle (as the bartender): That's good. I imagine none of y'all are married, then.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Is that a joke? Are you trying to be funny?Kyle (as the bartender): Nope. Just a question, I mean, I don't see any rings. But yeah-Goodrich: [laughing] That's okay. No, I'm just mad at the- No, we're not married.Kyle (as the bartender): Excellent.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): You're good.Kyle (as the bartender): Well, not excellent, but you do your life.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): I mean, what's that mean, are you doing something after this or what's going on?Kyle (as the bartender): What brings to Durden's Punchbowl? I'm Bradward. I'll be your bartender. What can I get for you?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Uh, you got any guitar strings?Kyle (as Bradward): Noo, I don't have guitar strings. I deal in like, food, lodgings-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Oh, right, you deal more in the edible-Kyle (as Bradward): -stuff like that.Kyle: Y'all go ahead and roll me your perception check.Goodrich: Oh it's a natural twent again, Kyle.Kyle: Mmkay. Did anybody else get above a twenty? Okay, so you're asking and you're looking around, and as you say guitar strings, the half-elf in the corner, that's checking off stuff on a list, perks up and looks at you and takes a second, and goes back to writing, but Bradward says-Kyle (as Bradward): No, uh, I don't sell any guitar strings here. Of course, you'd probably find some in Sundance. You know they have just your regular instrument shop that comes with you standard strings and everything. Is your stuff going out of tune?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Well, I mean, our teacher, Symbol-Kyle (as Bradward): Ooh.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): He thought I was, you know, kind of scrubbing it up a little bit on the guitar, and said ""Listen here now, get some strings. Some new strings."" And I, listen, I don't know what kind of strings he's talking about, but I- My first little test from my teacher. Kind of want to start off on the right foot.Kyle (as Bradward): Understandable, understandable.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): So, I'm looking for these strings which he said may be here, so here we are.Kyle (as Bradward): Well, uh, I- I mean, if you're- If you're looking for standard strings, they're the ones in Sundance that I was just talking about, but it sounds like your teacher's not asking for just like a standard string, otherwise they have strings at Strumlott’s, but-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Oh, they did? Geez-Ali (as Yashee): He did send us here. Why would he have sent us here?Kyle (as Bradward): Maybe he was inferring that they were strings made of some kind of magical metal or interwoven with some kind of magical element.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah, you know, now that I'm thinking about it, I think he mentioned that, so, yeah, what's the story? Do you know about, uh- I mean, there's a, you know, there's a half-elf sitting over there. He looked like he might know something. He kind of gave me that-Kyle (as Bradward): I can go ahead and tell you-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): That sideways look.Kyle (as Bradward): Y'all gave me a good laugh earlier, and that kid was kind of a snot, so, I guess I could go ahead and let you know the dwarves of North in the Oodalolly range recently discovered a new type of metal called Harmonium, but the uh-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): I tell ya. Those dwarves up there, they're doing a great job.Kyle (as Bradward): I believe it. You should know I imagine.Goodrich: Wait, does he know who I am?Kyle: Uh, no, he doesn't know who you are.Goodrich: What, just 'cause I'm a dwarf?Kyle: It's because you're a dwarf. He's making a brash assumption.Goodrich: That's kind of insensitive.Kyle: It is insensitive, you're right. So treat it as you will, but he says-Kyle (as Bradward): I imagine you would know, unless you've been traveling away for a while.Goodrich: Would I have known about the Harmonium?Kyle: You don't know about it. This is the first you're hearing about it.Goodrich: Alright.Kyle: So yeah, he mentions-Kyle (as Bradward): I've heard traders talk about it. Unfortunately, they're saying that if anybody wants to use it, they would have to go straight to the source for it. They weren't able to buy any as the dwarves haven't fully assessed the value of the metal, whatever that means. You know their customs, so. Y'all could do that.Goodrich: [laughing] Again, what? I'm sorry. Okay, it's fine.Kyle (as Bradward): You know, you could do that. Does that.. sound like an option?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): So you're saying that we'd have to go to Mount Ain to the Oodalolly clan to get these strings. There's nowhere else.Kyle (as Bradward): Yes. Well, if that's not an option-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): It's just a long ways away. We'd- You know, I'd imagine there's some sort of quiz happening at school. There's probably lessons we need to learn. We can't just take off.Kyle (as Bradward): Well, if that's not an option, there is another place in Sundance that works in magical items called Mage Against the Machine.[laughter]Kyle (as Bradward): Perhaps he could imbue some wire for you, but I've heard that that gets rather expensive.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Uh, yeah. We could check it out. I mean, uh-Goodrich: I look over at Randy and Yashee, and I'm like-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah, I want to chat with this other dude over there that kind of gave me a knowing look earlier.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, he might. He might have what we need.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): And Bradward?Kyle (as Bradward): Yes?Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Just as a parting miscellaneous task we were assigned by our teacher, Symbol wants it to be known that he will be here on known as Splash, so if you can pass that on to your patrons, if he ever brings him up, that would be most appreciated.[Spurrier laughing]Kyle (as Bradward): Interesting.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): He was very adamant about that, and that we spread that as part of our journey, on our first quest.Spurrier: [laughing] Excellent.Kyle (as Bradward): Interesting. I don't know why, I mean, you know, he's a very interesting entertainer, but I guess-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): It's part of his new lifestyle. It's his teaching name.Spurrier (as Randy): He's workshopping it.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): He's. Yeah.Kyle (as Bradward): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): We're kind of spreading the word-Ali (as Yashee): Trying to reach a new audience.Kyle (as Bradward): I can keep up with his tunes, you know, he changes from one name- to Symbol, then-Ali (as Yashee): Stay current.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): The artist formerly known as Symbol.Kyle (as Bradward): Yeah, exactly.Spurrier (as Randy): [laughing] He's going by Splash now.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah, it's easier than saying the longer one.Kyle (as Bradward): I guess that's true.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Maybe it's a departure in his music as well.Kyle: Alright, I'm gonna shut this down now.Goodrich: Yeah.[laughter]Kyle: As y'all are kind of joking about this whole thing, the half-elf that's over in the corner actually comes over, and he puts his hand on Raz'ul's shoulder, and says-Kyle (as half-elf): I really am sorry to interrupt, but I do believe I could help you out, or- Perhaps we could help each other out?Ali (as Yashee): Ooh.Spurrier (as Randy): MmmGoodrich: I say- [laughing] I kind of inch away first, a little bit, like whoah buddy-Kyle: He pulls away like sorry sorry.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): It's fine. Listen, uh, you know, I'm a real approachable dwarf. Are you talking about some harmonium strings?Kyle (as half-elf): Ah, no, not quite. I haven't been up in that area in a long time, and while I've heard the tales and certainly just heard y'all talking about it, I work with- Let's just say I do something different. Uhh, if you haven't heard of phase spiders, then I've got a-[laughter]Kyle (as half-elf): I think I've got a treat for you. I just need to get some help getting my cart back to my place in Silk Grove.Ali (as Yashee): How far is that?Kyle (as half-elf): That's the forest just North of here. It's about a half-day travel. We could leave out in the morning.Ali (as Yashee): Ugh, half day travel?Kyle (as half-elf): Or tonight, if time's pressing. You know.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Did we get like an exam schedule or something while we were at school guys? I mean, I- we kind of just-Ali (as Yashee): No.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): -hopped out of there.Spurrier (as Randy): I believe we just got the sack.[laughter]Kyle: Yep. You got that fat sack full of Ira Glass.Ali (as Yashee): We could contact Symbol and see if there's anything pressing we're missing-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Okay. See if we've got to do anything, right? Randy, I feel like you should talk to Symbol. [laughing]Spurrier: I get out my Ira Glass, put it up, and sadly say-Spurrier (as Randy): Hey, Symbol.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes?Spurrier (as Randy): Is this the only thing we have to do? Do we have another assignment?Kyle (as Symbol): Nothing else can be done until this is done.Spurrier (as Randy): So, we're cool to go off and do whatever.Kyle (as Symbol): I mean, you're not gonna lollygag are you? Just-Spurrier (as Randy): You can't really lollygag in the Oodalolly. Golly all the day. See you later, Symbol, thanks.Kyle (as Symbol): Bye.Spurrier (as Randy): Byeee.Spurrier (as Randy) Alright, guys, I think we're good.Ali (as Yashee): Awesome.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Yeah, let’s do it! Let's go tonight, though, because, you know, I'm feeling frisky.Spurrier (as Randy): There's also- We're at a punchbowl. We might try the punch.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): You know what? Yeah. Let's get some punch.Ali (as Yashee): Alright. Three, three here.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Brandel-Kyle: Bradward.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Bradward!Kyle: Bradward says-Kyle (as Bradward): Oh, will y'all be staying for a drink, or?Ali (as Yashee): Drinks?Kyle (as Bradward): Perhaps the famous punchbowl?Ali (as Yashee): Three please. Three big ones.Goodrich: Or do they just give us like a punch bowl and we get cups, and then we kinda-Ali (as Yashee): Or just sharing straws.Kyle: Oh, dude, no, it's like a big giant punch bowl with-Ali (as Yashee): Three straws.Kyle: Three like wacky silly straws coming out of it.Ali (as Yashee): That'd be great, yeah. Let's do that.Goodrich: That seems like a good idea for an actual restaurant, like a place that serves up a big punchbowl-Kyle: There's places that do that.Goodrich: Really?Kyle: Oh wait, you scoop it out yourself?Goodrich: So, okay, this is just a small aside, but if anyone ever, in the future, is listening-Ali: A future restaurant idea.Goodrich: And you decide-Kyle: Ah, yes.Goodrich: There's a table, and they bring out a punch bowl, and you dish out punch yourself to the people at the table, right?Kyle: Yea.Goodrich: We can come up with a clever name later, but the punch bowl, geez, it's already there.Kyle: Bradward serves up this punch bowl with the three crazy straws in it, and like a few little umbrellas and stuff. Super islandy. It's nice.Spurrier: Little plastic swords?Kyle: Yeah, absolutely. It's got some maraschino cherries in it.Goodrich: Nice.Kyle (as Bradward): Y'all drink up, and if you have enough, perhaps you can enjoy the real punch of the bowl later.Spurrier: Ahh! Oh Brad.Kyle (as Bradward): Got a little action downstairs, if y'all are looking to scrap.Kyle: And he looks over at Yashee and winks.Ali (as Yashee): I do like a good scrap.Spurrier: Wait, if it's a fight club we're not supposed to talk about it.Kyle: And he puts his finger to his lips.Goodrich: Right, yeah, he wink’s as good as a nod to a blind bat kind of thing. Gotcha.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: So if we're punching it up, do we need to do a constitution thing, or?Kyle: Well, it's completely up to y'all. If y'all actually want to sit around and do the punch thing, then we can actually do some combat stuff. I can do a 3v3 kind of thing, or- Because i think a 1v1 would just be like long, boring. But yeah, put like three of y'all against three other people that are- show up later.Ali: We could make some money.Kyle: Yeah, you could make money.Ali: It sounds like we're going to need it for these strings. How much money you got? What are you packing over there?Kyle (as Bradward): Well, if you're looking to save some money, perhaps a little bit of entertainment could pay for your food and lodging for the night.Ali (as Yashee): I've got my mallets.Spurrier (as Randy): I've got my organ.Goodrich (as Raz'ul): And I've got my axe.Ali (as Yashee): Let's do it.[Electronic music play]Kyle: Alright, so go ahead and grab your chord dice you're going to roll, and what these dice are- We actually have- They are diatonic in the key of C, so you've got like C Major,  D minor, E minor, F major, G, A minor and B diminished, and then there's an eighth side of course, it doesn't just repeat C. That's going to be a wild one for us. Oh, wait, we doing wild, or-Ali: It's just a re-roll for now.Kyle: A re-roll for now.Goodrich: Once we get better as bards, we were talking about-Kyle: You'll be able to decide what the chord is, like once you play more music, you'll know what chords work better in certain areas.Goodrich: Exactly.Kyle: So, yeah. Each of y'all grab your dice. Oh, wait. Am I gonna grab one too?Spurrier: I was gonna say. I think that you're rolling one as well.Kyle: Ooh, I want to roll one. I get to roll a dice too, hooray.Goodrich: Awesome.Kyle: So we're gonna roll this dice, and then we're gonna take a quick break, and they're gonna write up a song to play to this tavern.[sound of dice rolling]Goodrich: We have F, E minor, B diminished, and D minor.Ali: Excellent.Kyle: Come on, let's see what happens here.Goodrich: Did we say that C is a given?Kyle: Yeah, we'll go ahead and say C is the beginning.Ali: C is always the fifth dice.Kyle: And unfortunately, we're kind of bound by that just because the dice is, again, in the key of C, but as we get smarter as bards-Spurrier: That may change later.Ali: Or we can transpose at some point.Kyle: Maybe we'll throw a twelve sided dice into the mix to change the key, and we can just use Roman numerals.[Players agree][Music transition]Kyle: Hey, everyone, it's your dungeon master, Kyle, here, just wanted to thank y'all for tuning into our first episode of bomBARDed.

He's like,Kyle (as Bradward): If y'all want to play a little tune for us, you know entertain the group that I have here, we can work something out. So by all means, have at it. Just take your instruments up there, and show me what you've got. There may be future work for ya.Goodrich: Alright. So, I guess we get up there, and-Ali: Guys, what's our names? What's our group name?Goodrich: Don't worry about it. They don't care. They just want to hear music.Ali: Alright.Goodrich: Also, we don't have one yet.[laughing]Spurrier: Class As. No? Alright.Goodrich: The Boyscout Uniform.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: So we're up there on stage. The light's shining down on us as everyone's kind of quieting down, as-Kyle: You can hear the ribble rabble of drinking and eating coming from the few patrons that are there, but they kind of, you know, they start to look up. They notice that y'all are getting on stage, and watching y'all and waiting to see what happens.Goodrich: About how many people are in there, Kyle?Kyle: There are still, what did I say, there's like a family of four, two people sitting having a meal. There's about like seven or eight people.[Players make enthusiastic noises]Spurrier: Sweet. Sweet.Kyle: It's a small town, you know. Nothing big.Spurrier: It's like a cellar show.Goodrich: [laughs] Yeah, it's like playing The Cellar.Kyle: Rest in peace.Goodrich: One of these people might be like a label executive though? So you know, you've gotta give it your all all the time.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: That's a good point.Kyle: For those outside of our cultural circle, that was a venue we used to play, so if you're outside the DFW area.Goodrich: Anyhoo, so I look at you guys, and I say-Goodrich (as Raz'ul): Listen, I think I got something for this. A little something I was working up on the road. Just follow my lead, okay?Ali (as Yashee): Alright.[Guitar music begins playing. A drum soon joins.]All three: [singing] Lend your ears and hear a tale about some bards while quaffing ale, a fearsome three, who musically collect the bits of history.Ali: [singing] Yashee she's a barbarian as tall as she can be. She'll fight all night, but she's all right. A scrapper yes indeed.Goodrich: [singing] Raz'ul son of Daz'ul, he's a druid and a dwarf. An Oodalolly hailing from the mountains of the North.Spurrier: [singing] And there's Randyyy.Ali and Goodrich: [singing] Randy!Spurrier: [singing]: Randyyy.Ali and Goodrich: [singing] Randy!Spurrier: [singing] Yes, I'm Randyyy.Ali and Goodrich: [singing] Randyyy.Spurrier: [singing] Yes, I'm Randyy.Ali and Goodrich: [singing] Randall!Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, it’s Randy.All three: [singing] Is his name.[Music fades]Kyle: Yeah, y'all finish up the song. You hear you know, the audience [clapping in the background] in here.Goodrich: The seven people like woo!Kyle: They're clapping, and they're like, yeah, yeah. The little girls that are sitting with their family definitely seem enthralled, and they're looking at-Spurrier: Also a drunk.Kyle: Yeah, they're a little drunk, and they're looking at Yashee, and you see them like taking their cutlery, and like, pounding beats and everything like that.Ali: I'm twirling my mallets in the back like, what up.Spurrier: Yes.Kyle: You can see Bradward in the back behind he's washing the dishes and he gives you a sweet thumbs up. You know, from the back, and kind of like, grins. And you see him go into the back and come out with a couple plates, and he starts cooking up some food, and he gestures y'all to come on over and have a seat, and enjoy some food after that little tune. We'll go ahead and say, we're gonna call it here. We'll find out next time whether y'all are planning on spending the night and getting into some brawling, or if we're gonna go ahead and see what the half-elf has in store for y'all. So, join us next time on bomBARDed to find out the result of that."

II[Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed.  Let’s sum up last episode real quick. Our heroes started off by decorating their dorm rooms, spent a little time with that. And eventually made their way down to the cafetorium where they met the cook, Alto Brown. They sang a song to order up some food and while they were waiting they had a little chat with Tabitha, who was going to head up to the practice rooms for a little bit of sparring. Tabitha invited them along and after they dished down on the grub that they got they made their way up-Goodrich: (in a deep voice) Now that’s what I call brunch![Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah, they brunched hard!Goodrich: We’re back, right?Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: Okay [laughs]Kyle: Yeah, you’re back, you’re here. I’m not by myself.Goodrich: [unsure] Never mind.[All laugh]Kyle: So, we- they made their way up to the practice rooms and had a little bit of a spar with Tabitha. Which ended in a little bit of an odd moment for ya’ll. I mean, you know, she kind of had a weird kind of turn of events. Ya know, eventually came to-Goodrich: Got a little spooky.Kyle: Yeah, exactly! You know- it's kind of-Goodrich: It’s close to Halloween so-Kyle: Yeah! Oh, wooo!Goodrich: Maybe it was all just a big prank.Kyle: Maybe![Players laugh]Kyle: We’ll have to see. She appeared, you know kind of embarrassed more or less but she ran off and you decided after a small skirmish like that you should probably rest up a little bit. You did your song of rest and chilled out in your dorm room and- Randy we had a slight moment while Yashee and Raz’ul had their nap. And we are going to pick back up right where we left off, which last time I asked you Raz’ul and Yashee for a perception check-Goodrich: Mine was eight plus three eleven.Ali: We both had eleven.Goodrich: Awww!Kyle: Both got eleven? Alright so you both notice- you walk out and Raz’ul you’re immediately notified to this. Something smells off with your potpourri, something doesn’t smell right. You notice, Yashee, that it doesn’t smell as sweet as before. It still smells not bad but it’s not as good as it did. And you both see Randy walking out and he’s like, you know, stretching from his nap and kind of looks at ya’ll and smiles.Goodrich: Could I- [laughs] roll investigation, I guess?Kyle: Yes, you can roll an investigation-Goodrich: I mean- I mean, I guess-Kyle: Yeah absolutely, roll it.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: That’s perfect.Goodrich: Does the perception check cover that?Kyle: The perception check is you noticed something is off, investigation will let you figure out what’s off about it.Goodrich: Let’s find out, Randy! [Rolls dice] So that’s fifteen plus one for my little jack of all trades.Kyle: So-Spurrier: Sixteen.Kyle: You’re riffling through the potpourri that you’ve made-Goodrich: [grunts frustratedly]Kyle: You’re looking through and you’re seeing all of the different blends of stuff and then you’re noticing like small sprigs of hair and like crust and whatnot that you’re not sure where these are from.Goodrich: Have we determined like, is your hair red like in real life?Spurrier: Well we haven’t said specifically but there’s been renditions that have shown Randy with red hair.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: But there have been renditions that show him with brown hair too. So I think we’ll leave it up to the listeners-Kyle: The foot hair- you can’t tell through the layer of dirt.Goodrich: Okay, okay.Spurrier: It’s caked and crusty.Goodrich: Well I find this hair and I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey guys uh..who- what happened here? Why is this- my potpourri was jammin’ now all the sudden its been jacked up with this hair.Goodrich: I look at you two, and I hold it in my hands like a child with a broken toy![All laugh]Goodrich: I have just a single tear running down my cheek.Ali: I’m busy like smelling myself, just to see if it’s me like-[All laugh]Ali: Then I look back at you-Ali(as Yashee): Oh gosh, where did that come from?Spurrier: Randy walks over and wafts it to himself and..retches. Disgusted. Do I need to do a deception retch?[Players laugh]Spurrier: To see if I can like, fake it and convince him?Kyle: Yeah, go for it!Spurrier: I’m disgusted- that is a fifteen plus six, twenty-one.Kyle: Yeah, I mean, he’s pretty convincing but you know, he retches back a little bit and takes a step back. Raz’ul, give me a perception check. Goodrich: Alright, [roll dice] that’s a six plus three, nine.Kyle: Okay, you’re looking down in the potpourri and like Randy takes a step back and you notice there’s a small patch of hair missing on the top of Randy’s foot.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Ah! J’accuse![All laugh]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): It was you wasn’t it, Randy?Spurrier(as Randy): Listen, Listen-Ali(as Yashee): Aw, Randy!Goodrich(Raz’ul): Look I get it, it's Halloween, right? You're having a fun little prank. Was it you? I mean.. You know..Right? Look I'm not mad- in fact I was getting kind of tired of this one. I like to kind of refresh it often so I was gonna replace it anyways so..Spurrier(as Randy): It was.. I apologize-Goodrich(Raz’ul): Alright! Okay![All laugh]Spurrier(as Randy): It was an offhand way of saying I was ready for a new scent too.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Okay, well next time just ask.Spurrier(as Randy): Well, alright.[Players laugh]Goodrich: So, I guess I gotta get my next one ready. So, I kind of take the bowl and, tap tap tap in the garbage can or whatever.Kyle: Mhm.Goodrich: Then I put in some water, apple slices, ground nutmeg, cinnamon sticks, some whole cloves vanilla and just a little tiny bit of orange zest.Kyle: ooh!Goodrich: Just to kind of rid it of that burnt hair smell.Ali: Yeah.[All laugh]Kyle: Excellent! Okay so, the potpourri debacle of- actually it is the 199th year of the bureaucratic regime but-Goodrich: Everyone knows that.Spurrier: It’s canon.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely you know, it’s that year. But anyway, so- you’ve all cleared that up and everything. That was a fun little-Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Where do you want to go now that you’ve-Goodrich: [hums]Ali(Yashee): I know we’ve mentioned the library last time.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Let’s go read!Kyle: Okay, so we’re gonna make our way to the library. So, you head out from-Goodrich: Splash has something for us.Kyle: So, you’re making your way there and as you’re on your way to the library-Goodrich: Can we walk down the hall like the Sanderson sisters? Like [grunts rhythmically] you know in Hocus Pocus?Kyle: Gung ho on a mission?Goodrich: [mumbles something and grunts again]Kyle: Okay so yes, if that’s what ya’ll wanna do you can walk down the hallway that way.Goodrich: Yashee just has our hands.[All laugh]Goodrich: Let’s go, yay! Skipping down the hall.Kyle: People walk around you as you’re pretty much taking up most of the hallway you know, but-Goodrich: We’re on a mission from Splash.Kyle: You’re walking down these stairs and you hit a right turn at these stairs and you recognize a very arrogant tone of voice before you turn the corner. You recognize the voice of Garreth-Goodrich: Uh oh.Ali: Ugh.Spurrier: [Sighs]Kyle: And you can tell that he’s talking to somebody, do you continue walking or-Goodrich: I already had one joker today. [clears throat]Spurrier: [Laughs] What?Goodrich: What’s he doing? What did you say he’s doing?Kyle: You can hear him talking to somebody around the corner at the base of the stairs.Goodrich: I mean-Ali: I’m good to keep walking. I’m not scared of this guy.Goodrich: Oh, so we’d have to talk past him!Kyle: Yeah, you’d wind up walking past him.[Players understand and agree]Spurrier: Oh yeah, no we’re going for it then.Goodrich: Yeah no, I've got nothing to hide.Ali: Strut past.Kyle: Okay so, you strut on past him?Goodrich: We keep doing our Sanderson sisters walk [grunts rythmically].Kyle: Okay, so you turn the corner and notice he is talking to Christina Blackblade, his teacher. He's kind of talking and he’s got like a piece of paper in his hand. Do you just walk on by?Ali: I’m- I'm good to keep going. You guys want to go on past?[Spurrier and Goodrich agree]Ali: I’ll say hi to him.Goodrich: “Hey Garreth!” As we’re walking Sanderson Sisters style.Ali(as Yashee): Hey Garreth!Kyle: He kind of stops in his mid-sentence and he kind of turns and looks at you three and, he just like scratches his head a little bit. Does like an awkward wave and then goes back to talking to his teacher.Spurrier: And while- in the mist of him doing that wave while he’s watching us, I'm gonna try to sneak and grab that paper.Kyle: Okay!Goodrich: Ooh! Goodness!Spurrier: Can I have like-Kyle: Go for it-Spurrier: Advantage cause he’s distracted?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Sweet, alright so that would just be sleight of hand I guess?Kyle: Yeah, sleight of hand.Spurrier: Alright, fifteen plus six for the first one-Kyle: Huh!Spurrier: Is that good enough or should I do the second one?Kyle: [laughs] Yeah, good for it.Spurrier: Oh well, I'll just go for it then. Not as good, so twenty-one.Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: [laughing] He’s just holding this paper and-Kyle: Well no he’s got it like to the side and turns and waves with his left hand and as you’re walking by- Randy you’re able to like slip this piece of paper out of his hand and he doesn’t really seem to notice. And he turns and keeps going back- everybody give me a perception check real quick.[Dice rolls]Goodrich: Eighteen plus three, twenty-one.Ali: Fifteen plus one, sixteen.Spurrier: Seventeen plus three, twenty.Kyle: Okay, as you continue walking on you definitely maneuver this and you continue walking on. You hear him just mutter-Kyle(as Garreth): Sorry, I don’t know who the hell that was but-[Players laugh]Kyle: And he goes back to talking about his teacher and you really can’t hear what he’s talking about. So- okay, cool! Yashee and Raz’ul I need you to leave the room again real quick.Goodrich: [Laughs] Okay.Spurrier: Away you go!Goodrich: [From farther away] Bye guys!Kyle: Entertain yourself for a little bit.Goodrich: Kadus is watching Army of Darkness so we’re gonna do that!Kyle: Sweet! Actually that’s really cool.Spurrier: [Laughs]Kyle: Oh man, okay so- as you continue walking with Raz’ul and Yashee and you have the piece of paper with you- do you just carry it in your hand or do you tuck it away?Spurrier: Does it have writing on it?Kyle: It does-Spurrier: Okay-Spurrier: If you open it up it does have writing on it but as you’re like holding it in your hand you just hear in the back of your head, you hear somebody say-Kyle(Unknown voice): Man I didn’t even have to talk you into that, you just went for it man. You took to it like a fish in water.Spurrier: Randy just chuckles to himself, and he just says “contented.”Kyle: Excellent.. Nah that’s.. That's all you’re gonna-Spurrier: Yeah! Nice, okay!Kyle: Alright, come back in![Door opens]Spurrier: Alright!Kyle: Ya’ll can come back!Goodrich: How’d it go?Kyle: Oh it went really well.Spurrier: Swimmingly![Door closes]Goodrich: Alright you primitive screw heads-Ali: [Laughs]Goodrich: What’d you do?Kyle: Now that Yashee and Raz’ul are back- you continue to walk down the hallway making your way to the library shortly after you had passed by Garreth. You just hear Randy chuckle to himself a little bit.Goodrich: Wait, do we know he picked the paper?Kyle: You didn’t give me a perception check so no you don’t.Goodrich: Okay.Spurrier: I’m stealthy.Goodrich: Okay so just real quick, is that how it works? Like if he rolls a stealth check do we also have to roll to see if we noticed him do whatever he did ever so stealthily?Kyle: Yeah, anytime somebody does something in stealth you want to like perceive beyond your normal perception you can just say, “I want to make a perception check” to see if you see anything above the norm.Goodrich: Gotcha.Kyle: So like, yeah when- it crosses a bit of the line of like meta game in a way its- like a player character winds up like, “oh I'm gonna do a stealth check” and then someone at the table is like “oh I'm gonna try and see them do it.”Goodrich: Okay!Kyle: It’s like really you wouldn’t know that they’re trying to do that-Goodrich: Right, okay.Kyle: Unless they informed you of the plan.Goodrich: So, I guess-Spurrier: Contextual yeah-Goodrich: So, I guess for our purposes is you feel so inclined to this-Spurrier: Yeah-Goodrich: But if his roll meets our passive perception like, would we then be able to?Kyle: Yeah, yeah-Goodrich: That works then!Kyle: Yeah absolutely so, for what happened now basically all that Yashee and Raz’ul know is that you walked by Garreth. You said hi and he was just like, “uh hi.”Spurrier: Once we -Goodrich: What a goofball.Spurrier: Are we out of sight of him yet?Kyle: Yeah, you walk a little ways and you take another turn and he’s out of sight.Spurrier: Okay, so then at that point I just turn to you guys and say-Spurrier(as Randy): Hey you guys want to check this out?Ali(as Yashee): What is that?Goodrich: Are you holding up the paper?Spurrier: Yeah!Goodrich: [Laughing] Okay!Spurrier(as Randy): Got this off of oold Garr-bear!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Aww, oh look at that!Spurrier(as Randy): Getting kind of a weird glare from the angle that I'm at so if you guys could uh-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): No, there’s no glare dude. That’s a piece of paper.Spurrier(as Randy): It’s kind of chicken scratchy- I don’t know. Hard for me to read. You guys want to give it a go?Ali(as Yashee): Let me take a look.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Laughing] Is it too hard for you?Ali(as Yashee): Here.Goodrich: Again Yashee takes the paper, just give it to me!Spurrier(as Randy): Thanks!Spurrier; I put it at a better height for you.Goodrich: [whispers, laughing] Dude shut the- I snatch it out from Yashee like “hey!”Ali(as Yashee): Oh! Fine! You read it then!Kyle: So now you snatched it out of Yashee’s hand.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): ..Yeah I don’t want to read this.Kyle: It’s just like Episode one all over again![Players laugh]Ali: Alright.Ali(as Yashee): Garreth, here’s what I could find out about the Academicon- oooh![Goodrich and Spurrier “ooh”]Ali(as Yashee): It’s a trail that bards at Strumlotts must pass to receive their specialization. Also, your continued education at the school is dependent upon the completion of the trial- what? I’ve never heard about that. It's rumored that Strumlott built this but I couldn’t find proof of that being true. Hope this helps. -Caleb. Oh yeah-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Kay Love?Ali(as Yashee): Caleb.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh!Ali(as Yashee): With a “lub.”Kyle: Ha KLUV.[All laugh]Goodrich: [sings] 98.7 KLUV.Kyle: Oh god-[Players laugh]Ali(as Yashee): Oh yeah, have you given any thought to my offer? We could use someone like you, just sayin’.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I- did you- where'd you get this?Spurrier(as Randy): Garreth.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Like- like just now? Garreth? You took it from him!?Ali(as Yashee): You sneaky little boy.Spurrier(as Randy): I-I was bored.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Yeah, I was having a good time too.Spurrier(as Randy): It’s Garreth, I mean come on-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Okay-Spurrier(as Randy): What else were we gonna do?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Randy.Spurrier(as Randy): Yes?Goodrich(as Raz’ul) What you did was wrong.Spurrier(as Randy): Eh..Goodrich:(as Raz’ul): And we should go give this back to Garreth.Spurrier(as Randy): Eh..Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I think.. I could sneak it back to Garreth?Spurrier(as Randy): I mean, if you want. I'm not sneaking it back to him.Ali(as Yashee): Just go throw it over there on the floor or something.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh like he dropped it?Ali(as Yashee): Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Okay, let’s do that.Goodrich: Can we-Ali(Yashee): I mean he obviously didn’t notice it was taken in the first place.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah but, you know, I wonder who Caleb is. Also, why hasn’t Splash told us about this? This seems like a pretty big deal!Ali(as Yashee): We have to like do that to be able to graduate.Spurrier(as Randy): The questions grow and grow.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Sighs] Splash..Goodrich: Okay, can we take our little Sanderson sister’s walk and like one-eighty in the hallway?[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah if you want to like-Goodrich: Pivot! Pivot!Goodrich: Yes, if that’s cool with you guys.Spurrier: I mean-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): We’ll be sneaky, I’ll sneak it back to him. I'll make sure he doesn’t know. Thanks for the info but again, just ask Randy.Spurrier:(as Randy): ...Why?Goodrich: [Laughing] Alright.Spurrier(as Randy): You’re the stealthiest dwarf I know, you can get it back to him.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh, well aww, thanks!Goodrich: Okay so, I guess we’re gonna walk back past him-Kyle: All three- and you’re gonna sleight of hand throw it near his foot or something?Goodrich: Yeah-Kyle: What’s your plan?Goodrich: Yes, so as we’re walking past him Sanderson sister style- [Spurrier and Goodrich grunt rhythmically]. I would like to- yeah just kind of toss it onto the floor so it’s as if he dropped it.Kyle: Okay, after pouring over this note for a moment you turn around and your heading back. You notice that he’s just standing there by himself now and he’s looking around on the ground like in the area where he was.Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: As you approach.Goodrich: I still want to just sneak it to him.Kyle: Okay, go for it. So, you’re walking on by and go ahead and roll me that sleight of hand.Goodrich: [Hums the Indiana Jones theme] It’s a- [laughs] It’s a four! Four plus one five.Kyle: Okay-[All laugh]Kyle: So, you’re walking by and he- you kind of like throw it out and-[Players laugh]Kyle: Garreth like, immediately turns his head and sees it and he points at you and says-Kyle(as Garreth): Hey! Dwarf, dwarf stop right there! Where did you get that note?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Gasps] Uhh..what note?Ali(as Yashee): Run, run!Kyle: Do you just want to run?[All laughing hysterically]Goodrich: Can we just one-eighty and bolt down the hallway?Kyle: Yeah, yes you absolutely can.Goodrich: Okay! I yell “Pivot, pivot, pivot, pivot!”Spurrier: Go!Kyle: Okay, he starts to run after you then like stops for a moment and turns around and goes back to get the note. Turns around just to see you kind of look back as he’s picking up the note and turning around and he’s like shaking his fist.Kyle(as Garreth): I don’t know who you three are but this is a small school and I'll find you eventually!Goodrich: I shout-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): We’re Chaos Sauce, sucker!Spurrier(as Randy): Bye Garreth![All laugh]Kyle: And yeah, ya’ll ‘round the corner and he’s not in pursuit. He has his note back he’ll probably be alright.Goodrich: Hurray!Ali: Alright!Kyle: Plus, you just gave him your name so-Goodrich: That went really well! I could have used a spell but-Ali: Oh yeah.Kyle: Yeah that would have been a nifty idea, whatever but- you run around the corner and you’re all laughing and like “ahahaha! We got away with it ahahaha!”[Players simultaneously “ahahaha”] Kyle: And you know eventually make your way to the library. You enter the corridor that leads to the library’s front doors. You notice there’s a small like, inlet in this hallways before you get to the library and you see a sign that says, “Commissary” and all you see in this inlet is a desk that’s flush with it and you see a really skinny girl with like straight black hair sitting behind the desk just reading like- flipping through this book and looking through stuff and just looking down. Doesn’t even acknowledge ya’ll as ya’ll walk by.Goodrich: Should we..?Spurrier: I say we press on.Ali: Yeah!Spurrier: Let’s go to the library first, we’ll-Goodrich: We’ll buy stuff later.Ali: She’s minding her own business.Kyle: So yeah, ya’ll head onto the library and you walk in and it’s these big double doors that open up and- pretty much there’s a reading area as you walk in. You can see like books stacked up on the table, plenty of room to sit down and read, comfy chairs and whatnot. But you notice that there’s three, really tall, really long aisle of books. So one of the branches- it's basically broken up into three branches. You have a branch of magic, music and, history. There's an older librarian standing behind the desk. He's a human, a little bit withered, probably in his sixties or something but he has obviously dyed jet-black hair and there’s a placard next to him that just says, “Mr. Read.” He’s just reading a book and the sign behind him says, “Ask for assistance if needed.”Goodrich: What kind of book is he reading?Kyle: You don’t know, you’d have to walk up and ask.Goodrich: Oh! Right, well let’s do it.Spurrier: Yeah, say hey.Goodrich:[Laughs] Alright, let’s go see him.Kyle: Alright so you all walk up. He peers up from his book and it’s actually like a journal that he’s writing in and keeping things you know like, small stamps and you notice he’s breaking up poetry and everything. He stops and he closes his books and he looks up at ya’ll and like-Kyle(as Mr. Read): Oh, welcome to the library. It's a perfect day, isn’t it?Ali(as Yashee): Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah uh, listen Symbol said to come and talk to you about something he just-Kyle: He gets a look of surprise on his face and is just like-Kyle(as Mr. Read): Oh, you’re Symbol’s students, excellent. I've actually been holding onto something he gave it to me earlier today-Goodrich:[whispers] Oh he did, huh? Kyle(as Mr. Read): He was picking up-[Players stifle a laugh then burst out laughing]Kyle(as Mr. Read): Uh, great one! Really, really fresh!Spurrier: I turn over and I say, “Raz’ul nice!”[Spurrier and Goodrich high five]Kyle(as Mr.Read): No, he actually gave me these items I'm supposed to dole out to you when he sends you to me. He called them- actually now that you bring it up this does actually makes sense. He called them his Wonder Balls.[Players laugh]Ali(as Yashee): W-well..Kyle(as Mr. Read): Cause he wants you to wonder what’s in his Wonder Ball.Goodrich: Oh jeez..Kyle(as Mr. Read): So by all means, let me fish these out.Kyle: And he brings out like a little basket and puts it up and it’s just like-Kyle(as Mr.Read): You stick your hand in and you pull out a surprise kind of deal so-Ali(as Yashee): Oh it’s like a fun game! That’s nice!Kyle(as Mr. Read): Who would like to go first?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Why wouldn’t he just give us what we need? Listen, I'm getting like a little..Ali(as Yashee): Is this like, there’s many things in there-Kyle(as Mr. Read): Oh yeah-Ali(as Yashee): Or is there like-Kyle(as Mr. Read): He put many different things that you- I mean, it’s just treats. You know trinkets that-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh like we’re pets. Good. That's great.Ali(as Yashee): Or like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Thank you. Splash.Ali(as Yashee): A baby.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Or a child.Ali(as Yashee): Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I feel great.Kyle(as Mr. Read): I mean you don’t have to-Kyle: And he starts to pull it off the-[All players collectively tell him to stop]Kyle(as Mr. Read): You don’t have to take it, that’s fine. I’ll tell Symbol that you don’t want them.Kyle: And he starts to put them away.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): No, no, no I'm sorry.Kyle(as Mr. Read): If you’re gonna bitch and complain about what people are giving you for free then you don’t have to take it.Ali(as Yashee): Oh! Sorry.Kyle(as Mr. Read): By the way, keep it down.[Players laugh]Spurrier: Library.Ali(as Yashee): Well uh, I'll check out the- i’ll do it.Kyle: You wanna dip your hand in?Ali: Sure!Kyle: Okay, go ahead and roll me a d6.Ali: [Rolls dice] two.Kyle: Okay cool so, you reach your hand into this basket and you pull out- it's just a small sphere wrapped in tin foil.Ali: Oh! Okay, this is really pretty I think I'll start peeling it?Kyle: Okay, you start to unwrap it and you remove the tin foil layering to reveal just a glass ball. And inside you can see a smaller circle with like swirling parts and different- It just looks like different materials all like melded together in the core of this orb. And etched out on the outside of this orb it says, “thunder tap shoes.”Ali(as Yashee): Thunder tap shoes.Kyle: Mr. Read looks at you and he’s like-Kyle(as Mr. Read): Ooh, that looks like a special one! We'll get to figuring that out here in a moment, let’s see what your friends get and we can really figure out what these Wonder Balls have inside them.Ali(as Yashee): Sure!Kyle: Alright.Spurrier: Well, Randy steps up.Kyle: Alright roll me a d6, Randy.Spurrier: Ooooh, a five.Kyle: Alright, you reach your hand in and you pull out and you also get another tin foil covered ball and you pull back the package and it's another glass orb. Inside the material looks different than what is was from Yashee’s. It's a little bit more luminescent and glows but, still swirls around. On the glass is etched the word, “Drift Globe.”Spurrier: Drift globe?Kyle: Drift globe.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle: Mr. Read takes the basket and shakes it at you.Goodrich: [Laughs] ‘Kay.Kyle(Mr. Read): Do you want to go next?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yes.Kyle(Mr. Read): Do you want something? Or do you not?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Nah, no, no-Kyle(as Mr. Read): Are you sure?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I’ll give it a shot-Kyle(as Mr. Read): Have you gotten over it yet?Goodrich: [Roll dice] Tres.Kyle: Three. Okay, so you reach your hand in and you pull out- again, another tin foil wrapped ball. You unwrap this and you see like a dark material mixing with like metallic looking material on the inside of this glass orb, and on the outside of it you see the words etched, “Capo.”Goodrich: Alright.Kyle: Mr. Read looks at you all, takes the basket and puts it away.Kyle(as Mr. Read): Excellent, so you’ve all chosen one. Let's take those back to the Dream Forge right back here in this room. We'll get these items manifested-Ali(as Yashee): Excuse me? The what?Kyle(as Mr. Read): The Dream Forge, it’s an item that I've created that pretty much you insert prime materia into it and it’s like- creates this kind of item that’s inside the Wonder Ball. So, you input these and it’ll create the item that is given. You're going to be getting thunder tap shoes, you’ll be getting a drift globe, and you’re going to get a capo.Kyle: I’m gonna go ahead and give a quick shout out to Keaton Stamps which- I asked him about this a long time ago. He posted this in the Dungeons and Dragons 5e group on Facebook. So, thank you Keaton for letting me use this, it’s a great design and I'm really excited. I know I probably did a bit of a tweak on it but if you ever hear this episode- thanks man, I appreciate it you letting me use it! So, Mr. Read takes you all into one of the back rooms and it’s pretty much like the room is taken up by a large almost hour glass kind of structure, but there's no glass in the middle of it- so yeah a cylinder with just like four posts holding the top up from the bottom. And you can see a receptacle where you can, you know, insert these balls. Mr. Read says-Kyle(as Mr. Read): So another way to activate this is once you’ve inserted the Wonder Ball you must then activate it with your own custom words of passing. So, we’ll need to set those up and basically this will be a common phrase that you’ll use to initiate the machine and have it start activating. Now the only thing about is that there is a little bit of protection there. So next time you come back to use the dream forge this panel here-Kyle: And he gestures to something right underneath where you insert the Wonder Ball-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): This panel right here is going to display chords for you to use with your words of passing. This insures people can’t use imitations to access your allotted amount per year, which is four. So, who wants to go first? Who wants to take a walk on the wild side? All you have to do is set up your- you can generate whatever words or phrasing or how ever music you want. Now, later down the line the music will be dictated for you as a kind of way to, you know, capture you as the bard.Goodrich: So, are we doing this all together?Kyle: So, what we’re gonna do this time is a little bit different. I'm gonna have you each roll your own like, four progression chord dice and you come up with your own like, phrasing that is gonna be your words of passing.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So, we’ll use it this time and then of course next time, we’re still gonna roll it above table-Goodrich: Right.Kyle: It’s still rolling dice but it’s this machine generating random chords for you.Ali: So, this is our song for this-Kyle: This is our song, yeah-Goodrich: Ooh![All players talking over each other excitedly]Kyle: Surprise guys, it’s a little different this time!Ali: Nice.Goodrich: Alright!Kyle: And I know that kind of limits Yashee a little bit in a way but we’ll make it work.Ali: Yeah since I don’t have uh-Kyle: Yeah we’ll-Goodrich: Harmonic-Kyle: We’ll make it work for you.Ali: Maybe Yashee will just, you know-Goodrich: Rap?[Kyle laughs]Ali: Whip out a beat that she thinks is fitting and see what she can do with it.Kyle: Yeah, Mr. Reed’s just like-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): You know I think we can make something work for the uh.. For the non-chordal players in the ensemble so, we got a work around.Goodrich: You’ll have to channel your inner Beck.[Players laugh]Kyle: There you go![Electronic music plays]Kyle: So yeah, let's go ahead and break this down. We'll do individual dice rolls, just roll four each and see what you get. Does that sound- does that sound good to ya’ll?Goodrich: Yeah, do we maybe want to make it two? Per person? Cause with-Ali: Two with a C.Goodrich: Yeah two with a C cause since it’s just a password I mean, it’d be pretty short. It's just a short thing apparently.Kyle: Yeah sure, I'm cool with that.Spurrier: Could do something interesting stuff too anyway.Goodrich: Okay so we’ll roll the chord dice and I guess Yashee will wait.[All laugh, dice rolls]Goodrich: [sighs] B diminished and E minor, wow.Spurrier: B diminished and C.Kyle: Wow!Goodrich: So, diminished little passwords we got.Kyle: Okay so, we’ll let you two work on your own little thing and then for Yashee we will uh- we'll just let you figure it out, you know. I trust you so..um..Goodrich: You got this!Kyle: We’ll see what you come up with and uh-Goodrich: So, I guess-Kyle: Since it’s percussion, you know.Goodrich: Instead of rolling for the drum kit you’re just gonna pick one.Kyle: Yeah, I think that would work.Ali: I’ll figure out something that works with I’m-Goodrich: What you got.Ali: What I’m cooking up here.[Players all agree]Spurrier: Seems more fair.Kyle: Let’s break there and get into the writing process.Goodrich: Make some captchas![Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle here, just want you another thank you for giving us a listen.

And we told you we were gonna read off some of the rouge rock names last time- or from the ones you sent in from the last time we mentioned it. So, we’ll start with going to the right, Goodrich.Goodrich: Yeah! Thanks everyone again for sending this stuff in, we a had a really great time reading through them. My favorites were from moonshadowkatie on Reddit, they went for the gold, they had JGiles Band, Arrowstealth, Stone Temple Pirates, and then one of my favorites Fleetfoot Mac.Ali: Yes!Kyle: That’s very good.Goodrich: We had a lot of AC/DC toss outs like Armor Class/Damage Check, Armor Class/ Difficulty Class. Like Matthew Johnson who's’ inkstainsjacket on twitter and PaterVoss but yeah those are some of my favs.Spurrier: Yeah and uh, let's see here. Two of my favorites over on Twitter again from PaterVoss, he had the Breach Boys.Ali: Heh, nice.Spurrier: And then over on Reddit from ghosttypetrainer we have Deft Punk, so that’s cleaver!Ali: I had a couple off of Reddit from user BDH009, they had Good Charlotten-[All chuckle]Ali: And Imagine Daggers.Kyle: Nice, I guess Imagine Dragons would have been a little on the nose.[Players agree]Kyle: So yeah, I really enjoyed all on Reddit, trulyelse put in Jimmy Handtricks Experience.[Players laugh]Kyle: Which I thought that was really funny. Then Lily Blue on Twitter or @bluespacequeen put up Guns and Rogues, Fall Orc Boy, and They’re Actually Giants.[Laughter continues]Kyle: Which I think that was their friend named Whappy Dog but yeah those are all really funny. So yeah, we had a lot of really good ones come in and we’re really excited. So if you think of any more feel free to keep pushing them out there, maybe we’ll keep reading more but we had a really good time looking through those and reading those. We appreciate your participation in that.Goodrich: We try to keep the music puns fresh but there’s only so much time and we’re only so intelligent.[All laugh]Kyle: You know how dice rolls go, you don’t always pass your intelligence checks.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: So alright- thanks for joining me in this middle section guys. It was fun to do this but we’re gonna get back to the action and see what you wrote.[Music transitions]Kyle: Okay so, now that we’re back into it Mr. Reed looks at you three and is just like-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Okay, now that you understand how it works, who would like to start us off?Ali(as Yashee): I’ll give it a go I’m pretty excited!Kyle(as Mr. Reed): So Yashee, go ahead and place your ball in here and you know, it should ask for your tune.Ali(as Yashee): Alright!Kyle: Alright so you go up and you insert the ball into the device and uh-Goodrich: Or do you!?[All laugh]Kyle: And the panel below it just lights up and you hear a biing! [Ding] and the dream forge actually starts, and you see from each corner of the post material start to like, float- it's almost like those bits they turned that kid into.Goodrich: Oh, Mike TV?Kyle: Yeah, it basically looks like the bits that Mike TV got turned into and they are forming and coalescing together. Mr. Reed nudges you-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): That’s- Go, go now.[Drum beat begins to play]Ali(rapping): Unlocking the prize, forging from all sides in front of my eyes made true to my size. The forge is the place with the dream now resides, this half orc is ready to see her surprise. Imagination is racing while facing anticipation of this phantasmic creation, it goes beyond explanation. So, I'll go put in this ball cause my wonder is peaked, reveal what’s been made, let these dreams and I meet.[Music stops]Kyle: Mr. Reed kind of takes a step back-Goodrich: Whooa! What the-[Players laugh]Kyle: Now that’s what I’m talking about.Ali(as Yashee): Was that good enough? Did that work?Kyle: Yeah Mr. Reed kind of takes a step back and like-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Oh that’s..that was fresh!Goodrich: Yeah!Ali(as Yashee): Aw thanks!Goodrich: Were your palms sweaty? Knees weak? Arms heavy?Ali: [Laughing] A little bit.[Players laughing]Kyle: Aw man.Goodrich: Was there..vomit on your tunic already?Kyle: Tunic.[All laugh]Goodrich: Mom’s spaghetti? Cause you were nervous but on the surface, you definitely looked calm and ready.[Laughter continues]Goodrich: It didn’t seem like you’d keep forgetting what you wrote down.[All talking over each other enthusiastically]Kyle: And you hear a, bing! And shoes fall to the ground from the middle of this structure. You can see a really nice set of shoes that look like they have tap material, you know they’re basically really super awesome tap shoes.Ali: I pick them up- I mean, are they my size?Kyle: Yeah, yeah they fit-Ali: Like a one size fits all-Kyle: Yeah, you put them all you notice they stretch out to fit your foot perfectly it’s very-Ali: Back to the Future 2 kind of-Kyle: Yeah-Ali: Materials-Kyle: Yeah, absolutely, damn. You all see this get produced for Yashee-Ali(as Yashee): Ooh they’re very comfortable.Kyle: Oh yeah so, essentially what these thunder tap shoes are going to do is, when you wear them you can activate them twice per day to use the thunder wave spell.Ali: Sweet! Alright, I’m gonna walk to the other side of the room like-Ali(as Yashee) [Tap shoes hitting the floor as she walks] Oh, these are so cool..Kyle: Alright so Yashee slips on the thunder tap shoes and starts walking around breaking them in a little bit. Mr. Reed turns to the two of ya’ll and is like-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Who wants their next item?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh, I guess I could give it a shot. I mean..jeez, following Yashee-Spurrier(as Randy): Right? Yeah, best of luck!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I’ll do my best but uh..Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Yeah.Goodrich: So, I guess I go over to the dream forge and put the ball in can I do like a little woosh! Like a Skee-Ball kind of?Kyle: Yeah you do like a Skee-Ball motion and get it in there and the little diagram underneath the insert lights up like it did for Yashee.Goodrich: Sweet, okay.Kyle: And you hear the same ding! [Ding] and same reaction, everything starts to meld together from these little bits and particles.Goodrich: Okay so I do my Usumptin flip, bring it down it down and I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Alright, dream forge.[Guitar starts to play]Goodrich: I wonder.. I wonder.. I wonder.. ‘bout this Wonder..Baall, Splaash..[Music stops]Goodrich: And that’s it so..Ali: That’s beautiful!Goodrich: Not a lyrically laden as maybe a-Spurrier: Leaves you..wondering..Goodrich: [Laughs] WonderingKyle: Wondering, yeah.Goodrich: Uh, yeah!Kyle: And you know, Mr. Reed looks at you and is like-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Yeah, that’ll actually do really well.Kyle: And eventually yes you get like a- it's very small but it’s a standard sized capo. However, when you pick it up you get this sense like, I can hit people in the head really well with this thing.Goodrich: Like throw it at them?Kyle: No like, if I put this on my guitar, I'm going to be able to like hit someone in the head really well. So essentially like if you apply the capo to your instrument or to Axe Usumptin you’re going to have like a twenty percent chance of like hitting them in the head.Goodrich: Sweet, three-sixty no scope.Kyle: Yeah! So-Goodrich: Dig!Mr.Reed: Randy, come on forward!Spurrier: Alright I'll pop on over and pop in the ball.Kyle: Alright, and the little space below it lights up just like the other two. Ding! [Ding]Goodrich: Alright! Let's see this C and B diminished!Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: And I reach out and give the dream forge a little bit of a pet.Goodrich: Aw.Spurrier(as Randy): I’ve come for you.[All laugh]Spurrier(as Randy): [Shushing] I'm here now it’s Randy.[Keyboard starts to play]Spurrier(singing): Hey dream forge, it’s your old pal Randy. When I give you balls, we’ll both feel mighty dandy. And dream forge you know I won’t be long. And don’t you know, it was Randy all along.[Music stops][Goodrich laughs]Kyle: Oh man, people are gonna like start shipping the dream forge and Randy. I can see it now![All laugh]Goodrich: Okay!Kyle: So, Mr. Reed walks up and he’s like-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): You- you have a very interesting love for this machine..already..Spurrer(as Randy): Thanks!Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Uh but well done, well done! Kyle: And the machine starts to churn and begins to churn out the-Goodrich: Does it do anything extra special for Randy?Spurrier: Does it purr a little?Kyle: No. Give me a perception check. Goodrich: Perception check! [Rolls dice] Seven plus three!Kyle: Nothing that you notice.Goodrich: [Laughing] Okay.Kyle: Nothing stands out to you. Everything starts to coalesce together to this bioluminescent orb and you go over, you pick it up and maybe at first, you’re not necessarily impressed cause it’s like “Oh a light orb.”Spurrier: [Sighs]Kyle: And you set it down and start to walk away but then you notice it starts to like, follow you.Spurrier(as Randy): Aw sweet!Kyle: Yeah, so that is the drift globe. It’s pretty much gonna be like- you can activate the light, turn it on, turn it off. It'll follow you if command it to do so, if it winds up being like- pretty much if you move a certain amount away from it it’s going to go with you. There are only certain times where you can actually lose it or it loses light and we’ll approach those scenarios when it happens.Spurrier: So, I can like, say we were in a cave or something, I can have it go out in front of me to light the way-Kyle: Yeah-Spurrier: Okay but only so far away.Kyle: It needs to be within sixty feet of you I believe.Spurrier: I can just turn it on or off make it brighter or dimmer or whatever.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay, sixty-foot glow ball!Kyle: We’ll say you can choose the hue of the light as well.Spurrier: Okay!Kyle: and Mr. Reed says-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Well, I hope you all enjoyed what you were able to get out of those. I know its kind of a random thing but Symbol really wanted to give you something extra. He brought these by knowing that we had one- had a dream forge around so uh-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): So, he dreamed these things up?Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Yeah I mean you know these are kind of like his own inventions in a way that don’t have have to be invented it’s just kind of get the prime material together encase everything in the orb and drop it on in so-Spurrier: Handy.Kyle(as Mr. Reed): If you ever- of your if you ever deserve any more or earned any more ya’ll just come back and see me.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Ah, so he can toss us a treat?[Players laugh]Kyle(as Mr. Read): I mean yeah, if you want to put it like that I mean if you think of yourself as an animal, I think of these as gifts.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): That’s true I'm just..Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Being a dick.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah..Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah..sorry..Kyle(as Mr. Reed): It’s okay.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): It’s been a long, what? Forty-eight hours or whatever it’s been so-Kyle(as Mr. Reed): I mean if ya’ll need any assistance finding anything in the library of course feel free to ask me, I'll be more than glad to help.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): cool!Spurrier(as Randy): Shall we?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Thanks Mr. Reed!Spurrier(as Randy): Shall we mosey?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Okay, we’ll keep on steppin’Kyle(as Mr. Reed): If there’s anything else like if ya’ll need basic supplies there’s a commissary down the hall. You could probably you know, order most of the things you need from there. These are just little fun trinkets.Spurrier(as Randy): Hm!Ali(as Yashee): Well, thank you Mr. Reed.Kyle(as Mr. Reed): Oh yeah, no problem call me Lou.[Players laugh]Kyle: I was wondering if ya’ll got the hints I dropped-Goodrich: I mean I thought it was a reed like a reed on a bassoon or a-Spurrier: Yeah-I did too.Kyle: You could always look at it that way.Ali: I thought it was read cause he’s a librarian like, Mr. Read.Kyle: It was spelled r-e-a-d, yeah.Goodrich & Spurrier: Ooooh!Kyle: Alright so ya’ll leave the library and where do ya’ll wanna go next?Ali: Well I've got that pamphlet map so I'll bust that baby out-Ali(as Yashee): You know we talked about going down to the basement.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, the basement. Could be something useful down there maybe.Goodrich: Does it- are we-Ali(as Yashee): You guys still want to go?Kyle: You’re checking out the pamphlet and you notice on- like next to it there’s like an astrick at the bottoms reads, you know, “Faculty and Staff Only.”Ali(as Yashee): Oh, appears to be Faculty and staff only.Spurrier(as Randy): Well..[Players all hum in thought]Spurrier(as Randy): Well since we just saw Mr. Read.Spurrier: So, Randy pulls out his organ, gets it all set up in the proper way and says-Spurrier(as Randy): Alright guys I think I've got a plan.Spurrier: And he goes- [singings while playing the organ] Transformers, Randy in disguise.[Someone laughs]Spurrier: and I make myself look like Mr. Read.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Ooh, nice!Kyle: Okay, awesome what are you doing as Mr. Read?Spurrier: I was gonna be the authorization for getting into the basement.Kyle: Okay! Alright so that’s a spell for you. What is the requirement to- i mean what’s the DC for..Spurrier: They have to succeed in an intelligence or investigation against your spell save DC and my spell save DC is fourteen.Kyle: Yashee, Raz’ul, you have noticed that Randy turned himself into a really good disguise of Mr. Read.Ali(as Yashee): Oh that looks perfect!Spurrier(as Randy): Thanks!Ali(as Yashee): Any chance you can disguise your friends too?Spurrier(as Randy): It’s disguise self-Ali(as Yashee): Oh okay-Spurrier(as Randy): Not disguise Yashee.Goodrich: I know what I’m gonna do! So, since you’re a teacher, maybe I can transform into something small like a scorpion and just hitch a ride perhaps.Spurrier: A ride in my pocket!Goodrich: What have I got in my pocket? A Raz’ul! I should also mention that since we did a short rest I did get both of my transformations back.Spurrier: Phew!Goodrich: [Rolls dice] That is a thirty-eight which is- a riding horse![All laugh]Goodrich: Do you wanna just ride me down to the-Spurrier: Yeah! Let’s do it, absolutely!Kyle: Yashee, Randy, this is maybe like- what the fifth time that you noticed Raz’ul transform and each time it seemed- the first time worked out really well but it seems like the subsequent times have steadily just like gotten less on the nose. You know, you’re kind of just starting to wonder like, what are you doing?[Players laugh]Goodrich: Well hey, let me just say this real quick Kyle. So I transform into the horse cause I said um..so, whenever I roll these dice like I have to transform into it. It's not like, “oopsies let me try again.” I transform into it- so they see me transform into this riding horse. And I- [laughs]Spurrier(as Randy): Raz’ul that’s super cool but that’s not pocket sized.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah..well, you know.. I thought pocket sized, then I thought “what a way to make an entrance” right? Like-Spurrier(as Randy): I mean- could I ride you?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah! Absolutely you could! And you know I thought, again you know- I thought about it and just in mid transformation I was like, “you know a riding horse might be a little bit more fun.”Spurrier(as Randy): I mean, it’s grand I’ll give you that!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah! I'm going for the shock value kind of-Ali(as Yashee): Can you fit two of us on there?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Well-Ali(as Yashee): We balance out, I'm like a normal sized-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): But you’re still like a student-Spurrier(as Randy): But I’m like normal sized now- right cause Mr. Read is..Ali(as Yashee): Oh yeah!Ali: So are we just standing outside the library while they’re- while he trying out-Kyle: Ya’ll are- ya'll are doing this, you probably walked a little ways while talking about what you were going to do. So, you know, you’ve passed commissary by this point but you’re not like doing this in front of the commissary person but- but yeah ya’ll are just kind of in a hallway a little bit ways away from the library. Ali: You wanna head down? See if that’ll work?[Spurrier and Goodrich agreeing]Spurrier: Saddle up!Goodrich: Alright!Spurrier: Alright, you probably don’t have a saddle because it’s bare back.Goodrich: Well-Spurrier: It’s like some Cirque De Soliel-Goodrich: Yeah, I guess so because it says- [laughs] well, again I can like transform with my clothes on-Spurrier: Oh!Goodrich: So, but i’m- yeah I'd say they go into me. So, I'm just a horse, a riding horse. I'm like one of those Budweiser horses, I guess?Kyle & Goodrich: A Clydesdale?Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Those are big horses!Kyle: Those are really big horses.Ali: You could definitely fit on that bad boy.Goodrich: Well you’d still get shot down for being a student.Ali: [Laughing] Okay, okay.Kyle: Yeah, it’s true.Goodrich: So, you need to like wait for us to get there right?Ali: Yeah, I might just like, go down there and see what the situation is and see what I can do cause I don’t think I'll be able to like sneak in, I'm pretty big.Goodrich: Okay.. Lets- let's go! Let's do it!Goodrich: Clip clop, clip clop!Kyle: So, you’re heading towards the basement and as you approach the stairs down to the basement, which that’s going to be interesting for a horse-Goodrich: Can they not go down stairs?Kyle: I thought that was like a thing-Ali: Or is that cows?Spurrier: That’s cows yeah-Kyle: Is it cows?Goodrich: I think horses can go downstairs.Kyle: Hm..Goodrich: [Reading] If a horse can’t see the ground- Okay so the reason-Ali: Isn’t there an elevator?Goodrich: So, the reason why they apparently can’t go downstairs is because they can’t see like, their feet. But I'm a human err- I'm a dwarf in a horse's body-[Players talking over each other about how this will work]Kyle: That sounds like a good solution.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: You can go down the stairs. Problem solved.Ali: ‘Cause you know how stairs work.Spurrier: It’s perfect.Kyle: Absolutely, okay so again you make your way down the stairs and you hear the sounds of construction. You make your way down the hallway to the- towards the storage entrance and you notice it turns left into where the storage is, there’s a sign and everything. So are all three of ya’ll approaching it at once or- Yashee? It sounded like you were going to hang back.Ali: Is there like a nearby corner I can stand behind?Kyle: Yeah, they’re gonna have to turn a corner to be able to get into this area.Ali: Alright, I think I'm just gonna stand there and look like I belong and kind of just watch from the side.Kyle: Mkay, so you’re probably gonna- you're gonna hang back a little bit and try to eavesdrop I imagine?Ali: yes.Kyle: Okay so I guess it’s Randy atop Raz’ul riding over to the entrance. So yeah you see people like moving things, like these large stacks of like blocks. As people are lifting them and moving them you can feel this like, radiant cold coming from them. But these big muscular guys are coming out and moving them into the storage in the basement. And there’s an elf sitting behind the desk, he has his like feet kicked up but then he looks up and sees..[someone laughs] Mr. Read sitting on top of a horse and he kind of stops and stands up and is just like-Kyle(as Elf): Uh..Good-good afternoon Mr. Read! Uh, why are you riding a horse inside?Spurrier(as Randy): Delivery!Kyle(as Elf): D-delivery- okay um, I'm sorry but storage is currently closed for repair and modification. We should be available to take people in t- I just can’t believe- you're on a horse- Sorry just a little taken aback, I didn’t expect to see a horse down here.Spurrier(as Randy): It’s Strumlotts, I'm sure you’ve seen stranger things than a horse riding through the hallways.Kyle(as Elf): Well I mean- [sighs] I guess that’s true I mean-Spurrier(as Randy): It’s a little odd but it’s a standard day in the school. I think you would know that.Kyle(as Elf): O-Okay, I'll take your word for it sir.Goodrich: A good Mr. Read plan.Kyle(as Elf): Regardless I think it’s going to be best if you come back tomorrow. They're just doing this construction right now so-Spurrier(as Randy): This’ll be quick. We just need to get in, get out and we’ll be out of your hair.Kyle: Okay, roll me a persuasion check.Spurrier: Alright [rolls dice] that is an eight plus six.Kyle: Eight plus six.Spurrier: Fourteen.Kyle: He’s gonna take a moment and he like, looks around and he’s just like-Kyle(as Elf): Okay uh, be really quick about it though cause I could get in trouble. These workers are suppose to be like uninterrupted and you know with insurance and stuff like that it could get messy-Spurrier(as Randy): You can have Head Mistress Greenspire take it up with me if worse comes to worse.Kyle(as Elf): Well that- that's fair. Oh, by the way, I wanted to know what did you think of my paper on the Doo-wop Decimal System?Goodrich: [Laughing] What!?Spurrier(as Randy): Handy, it could be a little bit more polished.Kyle(as Elf): Okay.Spurrier(as Randy): I’ll get back to you, I've got some notes. I mean, it’s good it’s good just think it could tighten it up ever so slightly.Kyle(as Elf): Okay.Spurrier(as Randy): I love the concept, I think it’s very smart, I just think we could- crisper! You know?Kyle(as Elf): Okay, alright. I'll look forward to your notes. I'm just..you know I'll get it back from you next time I'm in the library.Spurrier(as Randy): Perfect!Kyle: Yeah you know and he’s like-Kyle(as Elf): Quick, go on.Spurrier(as Randy): Yah![All laugh]Spurrier: And I smack you on the hind quarters!Goodrich: [Neighs loudly and laughs]Kyle: Alright, Yashee roll me a perception.[Laughter continues]Ali: Six plus one, sevenKyle: Six plus one?  Okay, you don’t really hear the conversation that just happened but you do see like the rear end of Raz’ul, you know sticking out, and then you see Randy’s hand go back after a little bit and slap it. Slap the rear and-[Players laugh]Kyle: And the horse moves on so you can infer that they got in.Goodrich: [Laughing] We’re at a full gallop now down the hallway!Randy: Right down the stairs.Ali: Alright, um so I've been watching from around the corner, have I seen anybody other than the guy at the door?Kyle: Other than the elf that was guarding the door there are just some construction workers coming out every once in a while moving these large blocks that- yeah just these large bricks that you see.Ali: Are there any of those bricks near me?Kyle: No, they’re closer towards the entrance of the uh-Ali: Okay, so I have a disguise kit-Kyle: Okay-Ali: Just in my stuff. Can I use that to look like one of these construction workers? I also have a costumes-Kyle: Yeah.Ali: I also have two costumes. So maybe I can dress up as one of these construction workers?Kyle: Yes, absolutely. Um, okay well let’s do the interaction and then I'll figure out a roll based on your interaction with this person okay?Ali: Okay! So, I disguise myself as one of the construction workers and with full confidence walk up and grab one of these big bricks.Kyle: Okay-Ali: And just kind of- I've seen them kind of go in and out I assume since standing there for a bit so I kind of just follow one in-Kyle: Okay-Ali: And see if he lets me.Kyle: The elf like, stands up err- actually he’s still standing up.Kyle(as Elf): Hey, hey wait a second I haven’t seen you with the rest of the crew whats uh..what’s going on? Where'd you come from?Ali(as Yashee): Oh, I'm new here, a new hire. I'm just trying to learn the job.Kyle: Okay, roll a deception.Ali: Uh, that’s gonna be a two plus one.Kyle: And he’s just like.Kyle(as Elf): Um, new on the job? I mean nobody brought us any new paperwork or anything, at least I haven’t heard anything. I'm probably gonna have to talk to your foreman about this first, lemme see if I can find him real quick.Kyle: and he starts to-Ali(as Yashee): Well wait just one second.Ali: And I pull out my mallets and.. [singing while playing a beat] I put a spell on you, and now you’re charmed!Goodrich: Whoa-ho!Kyle: Okay and I need a wisdom saving, I think.Ali: Correct, a wisdom saving throw.Kyle: Uh, no he failed of course. So, he is charmed um, so that spells allows you to do what?Ali: He- the charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance and when the spell ends the creature knows that it was charmed by you.Kyle: He kind of stops for a second and is like-Kyle(as Elf): Wait, wait a second I actually I think I do remember..Fred? Are you Fred?Ali(as Yashee): Uh yeah! Fred Rocksfeld!Ali: As I smooth down my mustache.Goodrich: You have a mustache?Ali: I have like a sweet handlebar mustache and yeah-Goodrich: Oh, for the disguise![All laugh]Ali: Yeah, a mustache just for this!Goodrich: Got it!Kyle: Well yeah, he’s just like-Kyle(as Elf): Yeah, yeah sorry- I don’t know what I was thinking I apologize buddy. Go right ahead and get to work!Ali(as Yashee): I appreciate it, I'm not trying to get fired on my first day.Kyle(as Elf): Oh no, I'd hate for that to happen for anybody but my apologies.Kyle: But he goes and sits back down and you’re good to go.Ali: I waltz on in.Goodrich: What you should have said was, “That was my horse”!Kyle: Bring it back![Players all talking over each other]Kyle: Alright so, you walk in carrying one of those stones and it just radiates cold, it's kind of chilly on your arms and everything. Um, but you can walk in and see like, you can hear most of the construction coming from the left hallway as you walk in. There's a hallway in front of you and you can go right as well. You walk into this crossway and-Ali: I go-Ali(as Yashee): Yoohoo!!Spurrier: We turn around and do a sweet little jump.Goodrich: Oh okay, so we’re doing like a little bit!Kyle: Ya’ll turn around, make an intelligence check.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] Would it be like an investigation or is it a straight-Kyle: Yeah let’s- well actually let’s just make it..give me a perception check.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: So that’s that roll still, okay. Six plus three nine.Spurrier: Twelve plus three.Kyle: Okay, Raz’ul you turn around- Randy you have to turn around because you’re on top. Raz’ul you see a construction worker calling at ya’ll and Randy you see Yashee in construction worker disguise calling at ya’ll.Goodrich: No harm new fowl for me I’m just like, “Okay..”[Ali laughs]Spurrier: I’m just like-Spurrier(as Randy): Oh hey! Sweet disguise!Ali(as Yashee): Hey guys! Good job back there, nice work with your horse.Spurrier(as Randy): Nice work with your ‘stache!Ali(as Yashee): Thanks, I love it.Ali: I’m gonna keep the disguise on for now.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I guess I'll just stay as a horse.[Players laugh]Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Still I'm just like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Whispering] Who is this guyy?Spurrier(as Randy): Hey it’s Yashee.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh! Phew!Ali: I tip my hat.[All laughing]Spurrier: I just pat your mane. It’s okay.Goodrich: [hushing] It’s just Yashee, whoa whoa boy.Kyle: So ya’ll are making your way through the hallways and the doors in this area are large circular doors and each of them display a set of concentric circles. Upon further investigation you notice that each circle represents a circle of fifths, one of major and one for minor.Goodrich: Nice.Kyle: You also notice there is a hole where a key signature should be. There's probably- just from guessing, looking around there’s a total of twenty-four doors and you notice that there is a different key signature missing on each door.Spurrier: Ohh..okay I'm just gonna try to open one really quick.Kyle: Okay so you go to open one of the doors and you know, you pull on the lever and it doesn’t budge.Spurrier: Hm, alright.Ali: So, are all the doors locked?Kyle: Ya’ll try out a couple more doors and each of them are locked. You know you pull and it's locked, it’s like you don’t have the right key.Goodrich: Ooh! Boy!Ali(as Yashee): There’s so many doors here, I mean if there’s anything cool in them I can at least narrow it down.Spurrier: Oh, yeah?Ali: So, I pull out my hammer mallets. [Singing while playing drums] Gotta, strange magic! Detect, strange magic! [music ends]Kyle: Hell yeah.Ali: It just says you sense the presence of magic within thirty feet of you.Kyle: You use your magic to cast a spell and you start using them as almost like dowsing rods to start detecting things and, you’re walking through and it’s like leading you. It takes a while to really hunt something down but eventually you arrive to the door where the key that’s missing is the key of A Major.Players: Ayyy![Players laugh]Kyle: so yeah.Ali(as Yashee): I think I got it boys.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I dunno guys, should we maybe like-Spurrier: This is weird.Kyle: Randy wants to try and pick that lock?Spurrier: Yeah, so that would be-Ali: Yeah sweet, do it.Spurrier: What would that be?Kyle: Well your proficient with lock tools so you add your proficiency and you have a lock picking kit so that’s three plus two on picking a lock, I believe that’s how that works.Spurrier: Well am I just rolling a D-Kyle: D20.Spurrier: D20, okay. Alright so let’s see here that would be a fourteen.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Or a nine plus five so-Kyle: Yeah, fourteen is good enough to pick this lock off the door and Yashee your mallets start like- it’s pretty much like old furniture and stuff it looks like maybe there was an old teacher-Goodrich: What a sweet fire sale!Ali: I shake them like, are these even working anymore?Kyle: But it starts to like lead you towards this desk and this dresser, it’s specifically poking at this door. One of the dresser drawers.Ali: Okay well, is it like pulling me?Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Okay so I'm already heading over there.Ali(as Yashee): Oh gosh well, I guess I'll see what's in here and-[makes a creaking sound][Players chuckle]Kyle: So, you open this door- you open this drawer and you find a small like cylinder and it’s hollow on the inside, looks like it could fit around a staff or some kind of stick. And it has- etched on both sides of it it looks like somebody etched in four string looking like things.Ali: Hm, well I'll grab it and I won’t hide it.Kyle: So, you find this device and with your detect magic you’re able to get that it’s more of a- there's an enchantment magic put upon it. Give me an intelligence check real quick, should be an easy one I hope.[Players start laughing]Goodrich: Nope.Ali: Well I'm already not very intelligent I got a two and I think I have a- lemme find it.Goodrich: Do you just put it in your mouth?Ali: It’s either a one or a zero so..Kyle: So, with your intelligence roll you can’t quite infer what this could do for you-Ali: I’m like a three-year-old like, square holes, circle peg.[Goodrich laughing]Spurrier: Can I roll one too since Yashee failed?Kyle: Yeah go for it.Goodrich: I’ll roll one too.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is an eighteen.Goodrich: I got a seventeen!Kyle: Well ya’ll both realize this could be affixed to a quarter staff or handle of a weapon.Spurrier: Okay, so I turn to Yashee like-Spurrier(as Randy): Hey Yashee, why don’t you try sticking it on your hammer mallets?Ali: So, I’m just gonna take it and I’m gonna look at it. I take out my mallets and I'm gonna try to put it over the top of my mallet and it’s just not big enough to fit over the top so-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yashee, underneath!Ali(as Yashee): I don’t know!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yashee, put it on the handle!Spurrier(as Randy): On the handle, Yashee!Ali(as Yashee): Oh, OH!Raz’ul & Randy: Ooooooh!Ali: And it slides right on.Ali(as Yashee): Beautiful, alright lemme just hit the wall and see how it feels. [drum hit and low tone] You guys hear that?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah uh-Ali(as Yashee): Is it just me?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh, it’s kind of loud too.Ali(as Yashee): That’s really low. Lemme try- lemme see it again. Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Wha- uh!Ali(as Yashee): [Low tone/drum get louder] Wow that’s cool, maybe-Kyle(as Worker): Hey what’s that noise down there!? George go check that out!Spurrier(Randy): Yashee, stop!Ali(as Yashee): Sorry, I guess that was kind of loud.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, a little bit.Kyle: Roll a perception check everybody.[Dice rolls]Ali: Seven plus one.Spurrier: Sixteen plus three.Goodrich: Uh yeah, sixteen plus three nineteen.Kyle: Okay, you’re trying stuff out so you’re not hearing anything other than the mallets and the bass that you have going on now- ya'll hear like footsteps coming from around the corner.Goodrich: Gotta go!Kyle: We’ll see what happens-Goodrich: G-T-G!Kyle: Next time![Theme song plays]Transcription By: Gabi"

III[Piano begins to play]Kyle(singing): Welcome back to BomBARDed, episode 7![Music flourishes to a finish]Kyle: Oh, hey everyone!Goodrich: Hey, let’s get going![Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed! To sum up last episode real quick, our bards had encountered a bit of a problem with Raz’ul’s potpourri. Randy got into some mischief and they resolved that fairly well. But after that-Goodrich: We made up.Spurrier: Yeah, we good.Kyle: They made their way to the library and on their way they encountered Garreth talking to his teacher. Randy was able to steal a note that Garreth was holding in his hand and they discovered something called the Academicon, they know nothing more than what they had in the note.Goodrich: You probably know.Kyle: No, I don’t.[Players laugh]Kyle: Oh wait, yes I do! It was up to Raz’ul who wanted to turn around and give the note back to Garreth ‘cause he didn’t feel it was right to steal. Unfortunately, this let to Garreth actually finding out that they had the note cause Garreth saw him throw it back and they hi-tailed it down the hallway back to the library and Garreth yelled after them like, “I’ll find out who you are.”Goodrich: I’ll get you kids!Kyle: And Raz’ul gave them the name of their trio, Chaos Sauce!Goodrich: Heck yeah.Kyle: So, he knows who you are. Or at least-Ali: We ain’t scared.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: I know.Kyle: Cool, cool. So, you made your way to the library and met Mr. Read and he had the Wonder Balls waiting for you as little gifts from Symbol and he showed you to the Dream Forge which you all set up your own little pass phrase to be able to use that machine and you got your items out of it. After spending a little bit of time getting those made up you headed out from the library and decided you’d get in some mischief and find your way into the basement.Goodrich: See if there’s something useful down there.Kyle: Yeah! Just do a little bit of exploring around, so Randy took the disguise of Mr. Read himself while Raz’ul took the form of a horse. Yashee kind of hung back and Randy and Raz’ul had an easy time getting past the doorman after a little bit of speaking. And then Yashee decided to disguise herself as one of the construction workers that’s working in the area and then charmed her way in there. They spent a little bit of time and searched around for some magic items and ended up coming to one of the doors that Yashee’s spell pinged on and inside they were able to find a device that allowed Yashee’s mallets a little bit of low end. Unfortunately, this low end drew the attention of the doorman and so we are going to pick up there as you know that he’s approaching.Goodrich: That bah-bah-bah-bass!Kyle: So how are ya’ll going to respond to people coming your direction?Goodrich: Um, I actually have a level 2 druid spell called pass without trace-Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: So we could use that, it says here that- so it’s a veil of shadow and silence, radiates from you masking you and your companions from detections. So-Ali: Sweet.Goodrich: And we don’t leave any tracks we can’t- we can be tracked if they’re using magical means but-Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Hopefully they don’t.Kyle: Gotcha, gotcha. So, what-Goodrich: I cast it! Poof! [Someone laughs] Alright, we’re gone!Kyle: You cast that and yeah- pretty much, it creates a shroud of magical darkness around ya’ll or-Goodrich: Magical darkness![Players laugh]Kyle: Is that what it says?Goodrich: A veil of shadows and silence.Kyle: Okay so-Goodrich: I play a little song while we’re going by like- [hums happily]Kyle: Yeah, I mean I'm gonna say it’s fairly easy for ya’ll to get passed since like a veil of shadows- I mean ya’ll are in like a basement. So, you know it’s lit but you know, not the best. Ali: It’s lit!Kyle: Ya’ll are able to make your way passed and through-[Players burst out laughing]Goodrich: It’s lit!Kyle: Along the way you pass like, that guard-Goodrich: We pass a rave![Laughter continues]Goodrich: We pass like two different doors of secret teacher clubs on the way!Kyle: Yeah, all the faculty are in this one storage area and just like dancing away- you know, sweating it up-Goodrich: Wait for-Kyle: Glowsticks a-plents-Goodrich: For real though cause if they are-Kyle: I don’t know-Goodrich: Raz’ul’s up for- should I investigate?Kyle: You hear something. Give me a perception.Goodrich: Eleven plus three, fourteen.Kyle: Yeah you’re- you’re almost out like you’re literally around the corner from exiting and you pass the person that Randy talked to on the way in, they were coming in ya’lls direction to see what happened- what that noise was. And you pass them- and as you’re about to leave you hear like a phat bass dropping- and it’s like you see this door doing this when you walked by but you spent a little time with the dousing mallets and what not, but this door is starting to like bump and you notice that the lock isn’t on it.Goodrich: You know Raz’ul’s all about getting down. If this is a sweet teacher club I definitely want to get in there.Spurrier: Well we’re still hidden right?Goodrich: Yeah, we’re still hidden!Ali: How long are we hidden for?Goodrich: Oh! Good question...Kyle: You’re only shadowed in veil’s for..Ali: I don’t wanna Cinderella in the middle of the dance floor.Goodrich: Yeah for real. Um, up to one hour.Spurrier: Oh nice.Kyle: Aw man.Ali: That’s a perfect amount of time to get down.Goodrich: I’ll open it up, Kyle!Kyle: So yeah, you open it up and it’s this weird much larger extra dimensional space that’s been installed into this storage unit and it pretty much just opens up into a dance floor. You can see like some older bards and some other weird doorways but there are some really odd-looking tough guys standing near them. Like, one of them doesn’t look- you haven’t seen one of these on your plain of existence or.. You would assume it’s a demon.All: Oh!Kyle: Uh-Goodrich: Hello!Kyle: It’s a- basically there are people dancing- it's a huge mosh posh of different races and everything, everybody is just having a good time. There's a DJ up there spinning some music and what not and he’s got like these floating crystals around him-Spurrier: Yeah!Kyle: And is uh, just spinning these different crystals and they’re making different sounds and whatnot and it’s creating the music that’s going on. Uh, but no, everybody is having a good time and it’s just these other doors like, certain people shouldn’t be passed this point.Goodrich: So, we’re on the dance floor and we can see these other doors-Kyle: Yeah, you walked in and it’s like a large dance floor with a large like sitting area around, there’s a bar set up- and yeah there’s two doors. One on the far wall from where you walked in and one on the right wall.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Well uh, listen guys- Raz'ul came to dance so that’s what Raz’ul’s gonna do. So, if you guys wanna go check out some crazy doors I'm just gonna be, da-da-da-da-da-dancin'.Kyle: Alright Raz’ul give me a performance check to see how well you dance.Goodrich: [Whispers] Sh-yeah.. [rolls dice] So fifteen plus three, eighteen.Kyle: Okay, so you’re able to cut a rug pretty well.Goodrich: Wait, I'm still invisible so I'm like dancing by myself [laughs].Kyle: Dude that’s all you need is to dance for yourself.[Players laugh]Ali: [Singing] Dancing with myself.Kyle: You don’t need to dance for anyone else.Goodrich: [Yelling] Don’t tell me not to dance, dad!Kyle: You can dance for you and you alone.Ali: So I’m gonna go ahead and change out of this construction gear, it’s making Yashee a little uncomfortable.Goodrich: Aw, little hot?Ali: She’s ready to take off that ‘stache.Goodrich: Hang on one sec, cause I think we can’t be apart.. Okay so yeah it says here that, we need to stay within thirty feet of each other in order for the spell to work. So if you are gonna go you gotta convince me to stop dancing, which is gonna be hard.Kyle: Nobody has notice in the process of ya’ll getting to the middle of the dance floor to dance.Spurrier: Randy’s dancing! [rolls dice] Eighteen plus six, twenty-four.Goodrich: Aw man!Kyle: Okay-Ali: So, Yashee’s not a big dancer. Uh, I mean- she unknowingly walks away from you guys like-Goodrich: [Gasps]Ali; I’m gonna go hang out on the side. I prefer dancin’..you know, away from people so..I kind of slink off to the side-Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Dance a little on my own, maybe start some hamboning-[All laugh]Ali: I don’t have any spoons with me but I can-Goodrich: Can we uh-Ali: It’s the only kind of dancing I know.Goodrich: Can I use a persuasion check to persuade Yashee to come and dance with me and Randy?Kyle: Uh no, I'm gonna avoid player versus player actions. Like- I feel like that takes away the uh, I feel like that takes away a player’s agency over their character.Goodrich: Okay, instead can Randy and Raz’ul do that sweet lift from Dirty Dancing? In the middle of the dance floor?Ali: [Starts laughing hysterically]Kyle:...Yes, who’s lifting who?Goodrich: I think I should lift you.Spurrier: Right, probably! I could try but uh-Kyle: Uh-Goodrich: Oh, I guess I need to do a strength test.Spurrier: Like an acrobatics then?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Okay. Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Oh you know it’s good! You know it’s so good! I got a seventeen plus three.Spurrier: You know I got a sixteen plus nine, twenty-five-Kyle: [In disbelief] Oh my god!Goodrich: This lift is happening! It’s happening!Spurrier: I’m up! I’m up!Kyle: It definitely happens and I’m gonna say- Yashee since you knew where they were when you left and made your way off- you turn around after getting settled in where you want to and you see them pulling this sick move. You're kind of bewildered at the fact that no one around them seems to notice them at all but you’re duly impressed!Ali: Not 100% up here.Kyle: That intelligence score, what’s that intelligence score again?Ali: It’s an eight.Kyle: That’s okay.[Players laugh]Kyle: Um, ya’ll dance for awhile, you get comfortable you do some hamboning-Ali: It has to be within thirty feet, how far away am I? I mean-Kyle: Yeah you’re in thirty feet-Ali: Okay, so I’m still hidden I'm just like-Kyle: Yeah, nobody’s really noticed ya’ll, uh…How long are ya’ll gonna dance for? How long are ya’ll gonna spend on the dance floor?Goodrich: I mean-Spurrier: We gotta have a little time to leave.Goodrich: Yeah, maybe we’re gonna dance for, what do you say Spurrier? About thirty minutes?Spurrier: Thirty, yeah, yeah..Goodrich: I mean I feel bad for Yashee though like, is there nothing we can do to get you going? Like-Ali: Well what’s going on with these uh, you said there were doors?Goodrich: I guess we could dance our way over to the door if you’re like really wanting to get at that door.Ali: I’m getting curious.Goodrich: Okay, I'm gonna cast heroism on Yashee. Is that-Kyle: Yeah that’s totally cool ‘cause that’s like a support spell it’s not like- you're good.Goodrich: Okay, okay. Basically what it is, is a willing creature I touch is imbued with bravery. So you’re immune to being frightened you gain temporary hit points, yada yada. But yeah, I just want to make you brave Yashee you can uh-Kyle: You better get it the right song.Goodrich: [Strums guitar] I- yeah.[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Gotta play the right song- [singing loudly while playing] and they say that a hero can save us! [music stops] No, that’s not what I’m gonna play. [Laughs] Um, so I say-Goodrich(singing): I wish Yashee could dance. Like the Randy, and Raz’ul can dance. Oh, you can be a hero Yashee, just for one dance-Goodrich: And then I come over and look up at you and say-Goodrich(singing): You could be a hero Yashee, just for one dance.Ali(as Yashee):..Cool.[Players laugh]Goodrich: So Raz’ul and I are like-Spurrier: I’m dancing on over.Goodrich: We’re like two wild and crazy guys-[Players enthusiastically agree]Goodrich: We’re like- [with accent] Oh yeah! We’re gonna go to the door, Yashee you coming with- Oh I should have done that all In Raz’ul voice.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [with accent] Yashee, we’re two wild and crazy creatures goin’ towards de door!Ali: Something inside me just says- You know what? Screw it, I’m gonna be my best self. I walk out there and join you guys.[Goodrich and Spurrier cheer]Ali: [with accent] I want to be a-wild and crazy too![Players laugh]Kyle: Alright so ya’ll are gonna dance up to one of these demons at the door?Goodrich: Yeah, and hopefully they can’t see us.Kyle: Alright so you dance up to the demon and you notice he’s just kind of surveying but then like looks at the three of ya’ll and puts his hand up- what languages to ya’ll speak?Spurrier: I think common and halfling.Ali: Common and orc.Goodrich: Common, dwarvish, elvish and druidic.Kyle: You hear him rife off this like- you can’t understand what he’s saying but basically you infer from the physical reaction that- it's just basically like, you’re not allowed passed this point.Goodrich: Yikes.Kyle: That’s what you infer from his reaction.Ali: Alright well since he’s speaking some language we can’t understand, I'm going to attempt to comprehend his language.Goodrich: Nice-Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: Do you have like a spell or something?Ali: I do, I do.Kyle: Oh nice.Goodrich: [mumbles] Oh okay, then nevermind.Ali: Alright. [Singing while drums play] Tell me something good, whue whue! Tell me, tell me, tell me! Comprehend your language, yeah! [Music stops] Yeah.Kyle: Okay so you’re able to comprehend language, and as you stand there he says a second time, which this time you understand him say-Kyle(as Demon): Your kind’s not allowed passed this point. Enjoy the dance floor, enjoy the music, or get back to school.Ali(as Yashee): Oh! Our kind? What does that- meaning what?Kyle(as Demon): You, not us.Ali(as Yashee): You- you got something against-Kyle(as Demon): We provide our music to this small sect of your plane. That's all we’re willing to do.Ali(as Yashee): Oh-Kyle(as Demon): This is for us to bring in stuff.Ali(as Yashee): So this- who is allowed back there?Kyle(as Demon): Extradimensional beings like myself and the DJ.Ali(as Yashee): Oh, well alright. Sorry to bother you.Kyle(as Demon): That’s okay, that’s what I’m here for. Just to let you know what you can’t do.Ali: So I’m gonna turn to you guys and-Goodrich: While Yashee’s talking to this guy I turn to Randy and I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey, did- did you have the time of your life?Spurrier(as Randy):..It was fine.[All laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] Just fine.Ali(as Yashee): Hey guys, I talked to this guy over here-Ali: I walked away from you.Kyle: ‘Kay.Goodrich: Kyle.Ali(as Yashee): Anyway, he said only extradimensional beings are allowed through these doors. Which is pretty wild.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I’m feeling pretty extradimensional after all this dancing.Spurrier(as Randy): Ooh!Ali(as Yashee): Hmm..Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Not so much, okay.Ali(as Yashee): I’m feelin’ ya but I'm still pretty curious about what’s behind those doors.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I really just came to dance guys, I'm gonna be honest. Like, it was good I needed to blow off some steam after this last day and I'm gonna tell you right now- that dance did it for me. So I'll tell you right now, I'm feeling relaxed like a new kind of Raz’ul going here. So listen, that door can wait as far I'm concerned. If you guys want to keep at it go ahead but man I'm gonna stick out here.Ali(as Yashee): I don’t think we’re getting through no matter how hard-Spurrier(as Randy): Demons are-Goodrich: I look at my wrist as if there was something there and I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah my spells probably gonna, you know, wear off soon so we should probably scoot.Ali(as Yashee): Let’s go!Kyle: Okay, so ya’ll still have a little bit of time left for your spell where you can finagle your way out of the basement storage area and make your way back up. Okay so after ya’ll leave the area ya’ll are pretty tired after dancing and ya’ll decide to head back to your dorms just to get a little bit of rest and relaxation after, you know, building up so much sweat. So it’s a couple of days that ya’ll are left around the school kind of mill- you know sneaking around back down to the dance club a couple times-Goodrich: Obviously.Kyle: Of course, it’s gotta happen now you know it’s there.Goodrich: That’s our Mirror of Erised.Kyle: Ooh!Spurrier: But with a lot more wubs.Goodrich: And a lot more dubs.Spurrier: So since we’ve been resting all of ours spells slots are-Kyle: Yeah, you’re gonna be back at full health if you’ve lost any, you have all your spell slots back and everything like that-Goodrich: Wait I have to ask, Ali, does Yashee go with us? Back to the dance floor when we go?Ali: Maybe sometimes, maybe have to play the hero song sometimes.Goodrich: Okay.Goodrich: Sometimes you’re in your room and we’re like, “Yashee we’re going to the dance floor, you wanna go?” “Noo” but we’re like, “Yashee, you could be-”[All laugh]Spurrier: You could swim!Ali: “Well okay, fine guys maybe this one time.”Kyle: Let’s dance![Kyle and Goodrich vocalizing to “Let’s Dance” by David Bowie]Goodrich: There’s so many dance songs, I mean, if you’re listening. I had to play the heroism song because my spell is literally called heroism. So, anyways.Kyle: So, you spend a few days around campus. About the third morning that you’re there you feel a little tingling coming from your Ira Glass, it wakes you up and it’s Symbol and he’s saying-Kyle(as Symbol): Hey, ya’ll get down to the café and get some food. They're serving up some blueberry pancakes this morning if you ask for them. Uh, so uh-Ali(as Yashee): [mumbles] We won’t have to sing for them will we?[Players laugh and agree]Kyle(as Symbol): I’ve actually got a whole stack of them so we could just eat and you don’t have to perform-Goodrich: Thank god.Kyle(as Symbol): So come on down, we’ve got something to do.Goodrich: Was that like a voice mail he left us?[Players laugh]Kyle: No, you hear the Ira Glass tingle and then you hear this message come out of it, it’s just like, “Hey get the hell down to the café, I got a whole stack of blueberry pancakes. We're gonna dome down and then we’ve got somewhere to be.”Goodrich: Got it, alright I’m down.Spurrier: Let’s do it!Kyle: So you make your way down there and he’s chilling- he's got a whole plater of like pancakes and he’s got some plates scattered around. He's just like-Kyle(as Symbol): So uh, have a seat and eat some pancakes and let’s talk about what’s going down. Ya'll get the wonder balls the other day?Goodrich&Ali: Yes.Spurrier: Yup.Kyle(as Symbol): What’d you get?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): You left them for us, man.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah I know but it’s a random thing. What'd you get?Goodrich: Oh right.Ali(as Yashee): I got the thunder tap shoes.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I got a capo.Kyle(as Symbol): Okay, yeah that’s-Spurrier(as Randy): And I've got the drift globe.Kyle(as Symbol): Oh the drift globe, I’ve always like that one-Goodrich: There’s an ointment for that![Players laugh]Spurrier: It burns!Kyle: Jeez.Ali: That one’ll follow ya!Spurrier: Drifted to my globe.Kyle(as Symbol): Well um, so I managed something special for our second assignment- and because of my, I guess, negligence from what Head Mistress Greenspire says. I'm going to be accompanying ya’ll on this one.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Awwwwww..Fieldtrip.Kyle(as Symbol): I- is there a problem Raz’ul?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): No it was an aww as in, “Aww, you get to go on a field trip with your students!”Kyle(as Symbol): Oh, it sounded like an aw like..”I can’t believe you’re coming along.”Goodrich: Should I roll a deception check?Kyle:..I don’t know![All laugh]Kyle: Are you saying, “aww-” what are you actually saying? Cause- yes roll a deception check. Do it again-Goodrich: No, no I-[laughs]Kyle: Do it. You already asked for it. Do it.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Aw, again! Uh, five.Kyle: He thinks you’re being rude. He says-Kyle(as Symbol): I- do you not-Ali: I interject-Ali(as Yashee): Raz’ul, we’ll get him a gift some other time.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Right, yeah alright.Kyle(as Symbol): Ooh-Ali(as Yashee): Next time we go out.Kyle(as Symbol): I like treats.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, we know.Kyle(as Symbol): I like treats.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): We got your freakin’ wonder balls.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, yeah- well that’s not a treat that’s- i mean that’s a gift. It's not- I like food treats.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Who’s a good Splash?Ali(as Yashee): What’s the way to your heart?Kyle(as Symbol): I mean, pudding-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Who’s a good Splash?Ali(as Yashee): Puddings?Kyle(as Symbol): Any kind of scrummy delights you can find. Anyway, let’s get to the point. So, a buddy I talk to who works for one of the newpapers in a nearby town uh, Luey Hewis, he was able to-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Give you the news, maybe?Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, actually that’s-[Players laugh]Kyle(as Symbol): His whole deal is working for the newspaper. So um, did ya’ll feel that tremor from the other day? Like you felt the ground kind of shake, it woke me up in the middle of the night. It felt something like, crashed and it was something that shook the earth.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I mean, I hear tales of there being a teacher club that drops a pretty hard bass but it’s only been hearsay up until now..Kyle(as Symbol): Wait a second, ya’ll haven’t been there have you?Goodrich(as Raz’ul):..No!Ali(as Yashee): What?Kyle(as Symbol): Ya’ll aren’t supposde to be down there. Ya’ll are gonna get me in more trouble, I swear to god.[Players laugh]Kyle(as Symbol): How did ya’ll even get down there?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Listen-Kyle(as Symbol): I’m not gonna rat you out I just don’t want anymore trouble for myself. Don't wanna know how it happened, just don’t let it happen again. For my sake, please. Maybe- maybe I'll take you as a gift, not a treat?[Players burst out laughing]Kyle(as Symbole): Again, I just can’t afford to get into trouble!Goodrich: I really don’t know how to respond! Like I really wanna believe Symbol’s being cool with us but at the same time-Kyle: How do you think Raz’ul would respond?Goodrich: Raz’ul would say- Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Look we like to dance, alright?Kyle(as Symbol): I understand.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I like to dance. Randy, you like to dance?Spurrier(as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yashee, occasionally.Ali(as Yashee): I don’t really like to dance..[Players laugh]Kyle(as Symbol): It’s okay, you don’t have to. In fact you shouldn’t, it’s restricted.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): You can dance if you wanna. You can leave your friends behind. You know?Ali(as Yashee): I-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): If your friends don’t dance, and if they don’t dance then- well you know what they say.Ali(as Yashee): I-I hope we’re still friends.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I’m just playing with you, Yashee.Ali(as Yashee): It’s just a thing.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): You’re alright.Ali(as Yashee): Maybe I just wanna dance with somebody. I wanna feel the heat with somebody [laughs].[All laugh]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): That’s fair.Kyle: So uh, he’s just like-Kyle(as Symbol): Okay, ya’ll got into a lot of day, so bully for me to follow the rules from now on, i guess, so that these little incidents don’t happen. Um, I don’t know if ya’ll heard about this but um, there apparently was a meteorite that-All: Oh!Kyle(as Symbol): Struck south of here a few days ago.Goodrich: We did see- err [clears throat]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): We did see a meteorite, yeah.Kyle(as Symbol): Okay, so ya’ll actually saw it. I guess that was on the way back to Strumlotts I assume but, I was able to convince the Headmistress to go down there- and since I was tagging along, to actually let us go down there and document the events that are going on. My friend, Luey Hewis was actually going to be covering the scoop so, I contacted him about maybe tagging along. He just said, “cover it for me I trust how well you journal things.” So yeah, we’ll be heading out here shortly. If there’s anything you need to purchase I recommend hitting up commissary before we head out-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh, Splash? Real quick though.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, what’s up?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): So we heard, through the grapevine, that there’s this thing called the Academicon?Kyle(as Symbol): Mhm.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Do you know anything?Kyle: He looks at you real quick-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Is there a pamphlet? Maybe?Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah hold on, let me check here.Kyle: And he opens up a bag like, on his side and reaches in about elbow deep-Goodrich: Is it like Mary Poppins style where it’s like, clearly magical?Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: Oh, cool!Kyle: So, he reaches in about elbow deep and he pulls out this big, thick packet for the Academicon. He starts flipping through and what not, Academicon, it’s like-Kyle(as Symbol): Oh yeah the Academicon, looks like it’s for end of second year students..uh, wind up getting your specialization there um..oh! It's there, that’s where it is okay, alright. Yeah it just looks like an event where eventually they’re going to place you into like different schools essentially. Uh, if you want to think about it you’ll basically be specializing in your own bardic path in a way. You know there’s some bards who specialize in like valor, there’s some bards who specialize in knowledge, and you know there’s different routes that you can go. And this is a test that’s designed for upper classmen most often. Let's see, what does it say?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, apparently we need to pass it to stay in the school?Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, yeah, yeah pass it to stay in the school. Also the bar for learning- well I mean, I guess you’ll be okay on that cause it’s apparently where ensemble spells come to play in the school. Goodrich(as Raz’ul): So we’ll nail it.Spurrier(as Randy): We’re good to go!Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, you should be good to go.Kyle: And he’s looking over it, and he’s kind of laughing and sneering to himself and is just like rolling his eyes, like-Kyle(as Symbol): This is kind of ridiculous- yeah so that’s down the road a little bit, where did you hear about this?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Juu- uh, yeah! Just, you know students talking in the hallways.Kyle(as Symbol): Okay.Goodrich(as Raz’ul):Locker talk, kind of stuff.Ali(as Yashee): It sounded like they were preparing for it or getting ready.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali(as Yashee): Starting to think about it early. Is there anything we can do to kind of get ready for this? Or is it more out of our hands?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Get a good grade, you know.Kyle(as Symbol): I mean, this is- keep doing what you’re doing, you’re doing fine. And I mean, you’re ahead of the curve considering- [whispers] the thing we’re not supposed to talk around other students. So-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Yelling] Oh! You mean- no I’m just playing.[All laugh]Kyle(as Symbol): So yeah, it looks like we’ll probably get to that next year some time.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh so no biggie right now.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, I mean there’s no- wait.. That doesn’t say second year, that says semest- oh.[Someone gasps]Kyle(as Symbol): Okay!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): What!?Kyle(as Symbol): Nothing! We’ll get to it later!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh-Kyle(as Symbol): You’ll be more than prepared for it I-Goodrich: Can I roll an intimidation check? [Laughs] On Splash?Kyle: If you want to roll and intimidation check on Splash go for it-Goodrich: Come on Splash, I need to know. [Rolls dice]Spurrier: Sounds like Randy isn’t the only one that can’t read.[All laugh]Goodrich: I rolled a ten plus three, thirteen.Kyle: Okay, I just rolled something. Ali would you would you look at that? Just look over here and see that? See that natural twenty that I just rolled?[Players laugh and speak over eachother excitedly]Kyle: Just to make sure.Goodrich: So does that mean that I have to do it and then he like, whoops me?Kyle: No you- yeah go ahead and-Goodrich: Okay so, so [laughs] so Raz’ul slams his hands on the table [slam]. Stands up and points all anime style at Splash- you know how they do-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): You mean to tell me that it’s next semester!?Kyle: He just kind of looks up at you and is like-Kyle(as Symbol): Uh, yeah I mean that’s still a little ways away. I mean, you as a trio are ahead of the curve already-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh right.Kyle(as Symbol): I’m not really concerned about this “Academicon.” [Goodrich laughs] What ever this school has come up with to try to “teach you to bard.”Goodrich: Air quotes, air quotes.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, that’s my job so-Ali(as Yashee): He’s just concerned about his grades…it’s hard to get into this school so you gotta really watch yourself.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, I-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I get a little anxious when it comes to-[All speaking over eachother]Kyle(as Symbol): When school has put a test in place to determine whether you can continue or not at this school, yeah I can understand how you’d get a little upset by that. Believe me I have more than enough faith in you three that this shouldn’t be an issue.Goodrich: I sit down all sheepishly. Cause you did roll a crit twenty right?Kyle: Yeah, he kept his cool.Goodrich: Okay, I gotcha.Ali(as Yashee): Yeah dude, eat your waffles and calm down. Getting hangry over there.[Kyle laughs]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): You’re right, you’re right I just need to eat and I’ll feel better [laughs].Kyle(as Symbol): It’s alright-Goodrich: Hungry? Have some waffles!Kyle(as Symbol): We’ve had a couple- a couple of rough patches so far in the little bit of time we spent together and I want to try and smooth those out the best as I can.Goodrich: You’re right.Kyle(as Symbol): So if there’s nothing else and no other questions that you have my carriage will be ready in about thirty minutes; we’ll be taking that. It’ll be about two, two and a half days travel to Basom.Spurrier(as Randy): Awesome.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Cool.Ali(as Yashee): Our first time.Kyle: You have 30 minutes. If you guys need to go to commissary I recommend doing that now. If not you can just go ahead and meet up with Symbol after munching down a little bit longer. What do ya’ll wanna do?Goodrich: We can go to commissary if you want.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Alright so you head back in the direction of the library remembering the commissary is in that area and the same girl that was sitting there the other day is still sitting behind the counter; flipping through a book, looking at it. You walk up and you kind of just stand there for a moment before she looks up at you from like underneath her bangs and she’s just like-Kyle(as Emma): [Sighs] What can I help you with?Ali(as Yashee): Uh..Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I don’t want to inconvenience you that’s for sure.[Ali giggles]Kyle(as Emma): Fine, then look in this book and tell me what you’d like.Kyle: So she turns it around and flips the book towards you and you see like this booklet open up but the pages- you don’t need to move them, you can just scroll through them. Like you can wave your hand over it to scroll up and down.Goodrich: That’s cool.Ali(as Yashee): I mean I was gonna look for something for my mallets to enhance them but, ever since I found this..I don’t know what it is- this sheath handle thing-Kyle(as Emma): Oh, the bassinator five-thousand? Yeah that’s pretty cheap-Ali(as Yashee): It has a name!?Kyle(as Emma): Yeah, you can buy another one if you want.Ali(as Yashee): What do you mean buy it? I didn’t buy this.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yashee! Shh!Ali(as Yashee): I mean, it was given to me!Goodrich: I like elbow you in the leg like, “Yashee, shut up.”Ali(as Yashee): It was given to me I-Kyle: Roll deception.Goodrich: Now you’ve done it.Kyle: It’s like the main roll we do is deception.Goodrich: Yeah, for real.Ali: [Rolls dice] I got a nineteen plus one.Kyle: Alright she’s like-Kyle(as Emma): I don’t really care where you got it, you have it and you can’t steal things from me so like are you gonna buy something?Ali(as Yashee): Where can I get another one? You said that you-Kyle(as Emma): You buy it right here, look at the book.Ali: [Whispers] What the heck.Goodrich: So we went all the way down there to find something that we could just buy at the commissary? [Laughs]Ali: I flip through the book to find it and I’m like-Ali(as Yashee): This one looks awesome!Kyle(as Emma): Yeah, that’s the bassinator six-thousand.Ali(as Yashee): Oh man, how much is it? Oh, I see.Kyle(as Emma): Fifty gold.Ali(as Yashee): Okay yeah, maybe it’ll make it like so I can play even more. Or at least if this one stops working on me I'll have a back up.Kyle: So Randy, as Yashee and Emma are talking about the bassinator six-thousand- Ali and Goodrich go ahead and leave the room-Ali: Again?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Bye!Spurrier: Goodbye!Kyle: Stay nearby. [Door opens]Goodrich: [Away from mic] I gotta go to the bathroom so-Kyle: Well go do that, this is the perfect time.Goodrich: [Away from mic] I’m gonna, jeez.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: [Away from mic] Byee!Spurrier: Byee.[Door closes]Kyle: Okay so Randy as you’re standing there listening to Yashee and Emma talk about this, you start looking around and you hear in the back of your head-Kyle(as Unknown): Man it’s kind of chilly in this hallway isn’t it, Randy? Maybe that potted plant right there, you could just start a little fire and warm up the place. What do you think?Spurrier: Randy’s just taken aback and-Spurrier(as Randy): I- I'm shopping! I- No? Seems like a little much, it’s just the school store.Kyle(as Unknown): No, no it’s not gonna harm anything. Start a fire, get it a little warm. She looks cold doesn’t she?Kyle: Um, and go ahead and roll me a wisdom saving throw.Spurrier: Roll..Kyle: Wisdom saving throw, yeah.Spurrier: It’s a one but luckily I’m a halfling-Kyle: Yes!Spurrier: So we’ll try that again.Kyle: Yeah [laughs]Spurrier: [laughing] Oh man, that is a seventeen plus nothing.Kyle: Okay, seventeen plus nothing. You’re able to shake this thought off in your head you’re like, “no this isn’t the time or place.” You know?Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: I’m good.Spurrier: Well we’ll say that it’s quelled but if you saw Randy’s eyes there’s still a fire burning behind them.Kyle: Okay, cool.Spurrier: So it’s starting to- yeah.Kyle: Alright, we’ll bring the other two back in now.Spurrier: [Away from mic] Come on back![Door closes]Kyle: Okay so uh-Ali: [sing-song] We’re baack!Kyle: Yashee you’re mid conversation when this is happening so I'm not gonna give you a perception on this-Goodrich: I was about to say, lemme guess perception roll time!Kyle: Raz’ul you can give me a perception roll real quick.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Man, right down my leg. Five plus three, eight.Kyle: No you don’t notice anything out of the ordinary. [Goodrich laughs] And we continue-Kyle(as Emma): Alright, are ya’ll gonna order anything else? Cause I really only wanna do one shipment if that’s what’s happening.Spurrier: Do you have like a list or anything, Kyle?Kyle: Yeah so she turns this book and ya’ll have a moment to look through it. Any specific items ya’ll are interested in?Spurrier: Uh, Randy’s scrolling through-Spurrier(as Randy): What about these cheaters dice?Kyle(as Emma): Basically they let you cheat. You wear earrings, twist them to the a direction you need it to be, odd or even. Left for odd, right for even. Cheater.Spurrier(as Randy): Oh, awesome.Kyle(as Emma): That’s one hundred and fifty.Spurrier(as Randy): Sold!Kyle(as Emma): Cool.Spurrier(as Randy): Nice, thanks!Ali(as Yashee): I’m definitely gonna get the bass handle.Kyle(as Emma): The bassinator six thousand?Ali(as Yashee): Yeah, I definitely wanna get the bassinator six thousand. I mean I was looking at this..diminution?Kyle(as Emma): Potion of diminution? It makes you small if you want it.Ali(as Yashee): It’d be fun to be like them sometimes.Goodrich: Aw!Ali(as Yashee): So I’m gonna get one of those please.Kyle(as Emma): You do have small friends, that would be cool to fit in.Ali(as Yashee): Yeah, you know.Kyle(as Emma): Or maybe they’ll buy two growth potions and they’ll fit in with you.Ali(as Yashee): It would be easier if I just bought one I think.Kyle(as Emma): But they’d be making me money if they bought two.Ali(as Yashee): Uh well..do you guys want to buy two?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Nah.Spurrier(as Randy): I just bought some dice.Ali(as Yashee): I think I’ll just take the one please.Goodrich: Little travel sized Yashee.Ali: Yeah!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): What um- I don’t think we caught your name. What was it again?Kyle(as Emma): Emma. Emma Zahn.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Emma- Emma, um you’ve been most helpful.Kyle(as Emma): Thanks I-Ali(as Yashee): It’s so easy to-Kyle(as Emma): Appreciate it.Ali(as Yashee): Shop through you.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle(as Emma): You’re items will be shipped to you in like a day. It'll be brought to you by Reginald Brown. Ali(as Yashee): Who?Kyle(as Emma): Reginald Brown. He’s my delivery wizard. He'll bring you your items and he’ll drop them off with you. Can you go away now? Unless you needed anything else.Spurrier(as Randy): Just wanted to say you look like you’re in your prime.Kyle: [Sighs][Players laugh]Kyle: She just kind of glowers at you and is just like-Kyle(as Emma): Okay..is there anything else ya’ll wanted?Ali(as Yashee): I’m good.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): No, I'm good.Spurrier(as Randy): Thank you.Kyle: She just flips the book back around and continues looking at it. Looking very apathetic about her job.Goodrich: Cool.Kyle: So ya’ll finish your interaction with- at the commissary with Emma Zahn and you make your way to the front of Strumlotts and to see Symbol getting this carriage set up with his driver. He's just talking to him, just conversing with him, looks like the diver is pointing at things like- “Yeah, yeah we’ll be good I got this worked out.” Symbol turns and he looks at ya’ll like-Kyle(as Symbol): Oh good, I imagine ya’ll got everything squared away so are ya’ll ready to go?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, let’s boogie.Kyle(as Symbol): Let’s hop on there, my driver will take us there. It'll be about two and a half days to get there so uh, let’s hunker down and maybe catch some Z’s.Kyle: So ya’ll hop in the carriage and start taking off. It’s a long- it's a pretty good trek-Goodrich: How’s our interaction with Symbol? Like- are we cool?Kyle: Yeah, he’s just chilling- you know, chilling looking out the window. I’ll tell you what, pick three questions you wanna ask him. Like, what do you wanna know about Symbol?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I mean, Symbol, from like the man himself. What's it been like being Symbol?Kyle(as Symbol): Oh well I’ve been to many continents and played in front of many people. Appalonia is probably one of my favorite places to be. Fantastic tasting wine, some of the best incense and if you’re into smelly good stuff- whew you’re in heaven there.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Man, let me tell ya, I could talk to you all day long about incense- all sorts of ambrosia.Kyle(as Symbol): Well yeah-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): But uh-Kyle(as Symbol): Love that smell good.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Aw man, yeah can’t get enough. But, lemme ask you this too um, Symbol. So, we’ve been kind of having a bit of a time with this whole magic and is this a normal thing that all bards go to? I imagine like, this is conversation that you would have with like a parent on the side of the bed. Like we said earlier like, “I’m going through changes” like can you-Kyle(as Symbol): The bards and the bees?[Players laugh]Goodrich: Yes!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Could you tell me about the bards and the bees?Kyle: He’s just like-Kyle(as Symbol): Oh okay. So you’re experiencing some changes in your body. It's a very natural thing to happen. Now actually, all joking aside. As I've mentioned before it’s very unusual that you were able to access the magic as you did. What we need to do is, we need to focus on honing that magic. Also another thing that I need to mention with ya’ll is the use of seventh cords. I mean, ya’ll threw some in in that song in Alo- Headmistresses Greenspire’s office which I mean- you're using them but just to understand the concept of them, you're just playing any kind of chord, major or minor, and you add a major or minor chord third on top of it depending on what you’re using. It's a fun this to doodle around with.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): You mean like this? [play dominant 7th chord on guitar]Kyle(as Symbol): Yup.Spurrier: [Plays a few notes]Kyle(as Symbol): Excellent.Ali: [hits a note on the symbol]Kyle(as Symbol): Great job, Yashee.Ali(as Yashee): Thanks.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, and you know you can change that back and forth-Spurrier(as Randy): [Plays a few more notes] Oh!Kyle(as Symbol): Yes, absolutely very good.Goodrich: [Strums guitar]Kyle(as Symbol): Very good, so feel free to implement those into your performances in relation to the magic that you can create either social or combative, it’ll have varying benefits. The main thing behind your ensemble is again, the words you speak how specific you are. From the images we saw you were really specific and very harsh to that ettercap. I mean, you were gonna die so-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Is it gonna be like that every time though?Kyle(as Symbol): No, we will refine this, shape it, you know. Now that you know the stipulations like, what can happen you might choose your words a little bit wisely, phrase things differently.Ali(as Yashee): I think we were just really scared.Kyle(as Symbol): I understand.Ali(as Yashee): I know I was.[Other players agree]Ali(as Yashee): I’m not a bug fan?Goodrich & Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: So ya’ll continue on your conversation, and yeah relate a little bit more. Ya'll talk a little bit more about incense and he goes into further depth about the Appalonian incense.Goodrich: I maybe share some of my like, sweet recipes for potpourri and different techniques you can use to really get some of the fragrances to really pop, you know?Kyle: Yeah ya’ll dish a little back and forth on that. Ya'll definitely bond on that level.Goodrich: Plus one bond!Kyle: So yeah that’s pretty much the first day as ya’ll you know chattin’ it up, talk a little bit about yourselves as much as you’re willing to reveal. So if there’s anything substantial that you want to mention to him, I wouldGoodrich: So above the table Kyle, we now have the ability to play major seven and dominant seven chords or major, minor seventh chordsKyle: Yeah, since he explained that like uh, Symbol says-Kyle(as Symbol): Let’s do this. You play me a song right now and we’re going to take your chords, and I’m going to choose a couple of them to add sevenths to. To show you a little bit of functionality.Goodrich: Like we’re actually-Kyle: He pulls out chord dice and he’s like-[Players laugh]Kyle(as Symbol): Let’s use these guys and see what we create. We'll have a little bit of aleatoric fun.[Electronic music]Goodrich: So just to- just to clarify to everyone, we’re rolling Symbol’s dice so this isn’t out of character, we’re actually doing this-Kyle: Yeah but it is- it is for the same process so-Goodrich: Right, exactly.Kyle: It’s, ho..Goodrich: So meta.Ali(as Yashee): I love games, this is fun.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] C!Kyle(as Symbol): We’ll have a good time rolling dice-Goodrich: C, D minor, if you roll a C-Spurrier: I did-Goodrich: No!Spurrier: [Away from the mic] Oh no!Goodrich: Nope, we’re doing it! It’s happening! This is what’s going down. This is what we decided when we were gonna roll these dice.Spurrier: What is happening-Goodrich: So unbeknownst to Symbol our- and not to mention we rolled the exact same chords as we did before- we still haven’t rolled a G chord! We still haven’t gotten that sweet five chord! That we all know and love! In- [sighs] anyways.Spurrier: The odds on that is- wow.Goodrich: Staggering.Kyle(as Symbol): I guess let’s roll the drums.Goodrich: Yup.Ali: Okay yeah, just so everyone knows this is not in character.Kyle: Yeah that is true, we do have to do that above the table. We still need to roll for it cause-Ali: Yashee would just kind of hear what you guys are doing and fit what makes sense, but really we’ll just roll for it.Goodrich: Okay, cool.Spurrier: Yeah.Ali: Use her bardic judgement, I guess. Okay so here’s the um, the bank coin toss. [Coin hits the table]Kyle: [Mumbles] It’s gonna be the same exact thing.Ali: Tails!Goodrich: Tails!Ali: Alright, alright.Goodrich: So that’s different there, good.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: So far, yeah.Ali: And I’m gonna- we've got that pattern which is forty-two [someone laughs].Goodrich: The answer.Ali: And that’s gonna be rock forty-five.Goodrich: Okay, like a forty-five alright! Cool!Kyle: Yeah, colt 45!Goodrich: I was thinking more like the record, but sure.Kyle: Oh yeah! Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.Ali: And then the kit is gonna be fourteen, which is disco two!Goodrich & Spurrier: Alright!Kyle: Interesting.Goodrich: Okay so let’s put it together![Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle, just wanted to say thank you again for listening and hanging out with us as always.

I've been reading a little bit here and there when I get that chance and I’m really digging it.Um, we’re gonna be doing something a little different this time since we’re talking about seventh cords, I think I'm gonna bring our bards in to kind of explain a little bit further to go in to some details-Goodrich: Boo!Kyle: There they are!All players: Hii!Kyle: So how’s the writing going?Goodrich: Oh, we’re done.Kyle: Done?[All laugh]Kyle: Good, I would hope so. Okay so let’s delve into this a little bit so, yeah- you have your basic triads: major, minor, diminished, and augmented- Spurrier do you mind?Spurrier: [Plays chords according to type named] Goodrich: Major-Kyle: Minor-Goodrich: Diminished-Kyle: Augmented-Goodrich: Augmented-Kyle: We’re not really gonna get into the augmented, that’s-Goodrich: Yeah, you could still build seventh chords off it but-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: For us, we won’t.Kyle: Exactly, [something] the most popular one is going to be your dominant [Spurrier plays piano while Goodrich strums guitar] Yeah, you get some of that bluesy sound.Goodrich: Yeah lots of rock music and popular music with those dominants so-Spurrier: And then classically you’ll hear the whole [Plays piano, V I cadence] sound. Nice strong pull to lead us back to the end of the song.Goodrich: Resolution.Kyle: So next thing is gonna be the major seventh which- [Spurrier plays major seventh chord] thank you, Spurrier. Yeah, some sandman action in there, right?Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: [Plays the beginning of “Mr. Sandman”] Those first four notes, yeah.Goodrich: If you wanna get spooky like the Stranger Things intro-Spurrier: Oh if you invert it- [Plays the intro to “Stranger Things”]Kyle: In the third of the chord.Goodrich: And then there’s like, X-files.Spurrier: All those kinds of spooky things.[All agree]Kyle: So, next one is gonna be the minor seventh chord- [Spurrier plays minor seventh chord]Goodrich: Nice and jazzy.Kyle: Yeah, little jazzy, little mario-y.Goodrich: Yeah-Spurrier: [Plays the Mario power up music]Goodrich: Little invincible-y.Kyle: Mhm, star power man.[Players agree]Kyle: And uh- so breaking it down from minor you have a half diminished seventh cord. [Spurrier plays half diminish chord]Goodrich: Nice and open.Kyle: Usually comes before a dominant but we’re not gonna get into functionaity [Ali laughs] or anything like that.Spurrier: And Clair de Lune the- [Plays piano intro to Clair de Lune] a little bit later in there you get to hear it sat on for awhile when you do this. [Plays half diminished chord] So that.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Kind of got a dreamy quality to it-Goodrich: Dreamy.Ali: Ooh, nice-Goodrich: Open, jazzyKyle: So next you crunch down a little bit more and get fully diminished. [Spurrier plays fully diminished chord] Mm, yes.Spurrier: Being tied to the train tracks.Kyle: Right, Snidely Whiplash.Spurrier: Exactly.Kyle: And of course, we have the spy man himself, the minor/major [Spurrier plays major-minor seventh chord] Some James bond.Goodrich: Yeah, and it’s also the last chord in the Sailor Moon theme song too.Kyle: Oh yeah!Goodrich: Just roll it out all nicely.Kyle: So yeah you know- maybe you can hear these things, maybe spend a little bit of time getting used to them. Thank you bards for helping me out on that. I don’t think-Goodrich: Well you should just thank Spurrier-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: Well you know-Kyle: Well it’s good atmosphere but uh- since you’re all done with the song, what are we doing here!?Goodrich: Let’s gooo!Kyle: Let’s go![Music transitions]Kyle(as Symbol): Oh that’s- that’s an interesting roll, nothing but Cs and D minors so I guess we’ll use all the sevenths that we have available to us since we only have two chords.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): We might need your help a little bit, Symbol.Kyle(as Symbol): That’s okay, I am supposed to be your teacher so let’s-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Let’s do it.[Drum beat starts, joined by piano and guitar shortly after]Goodrich(singing): Oh, Yashee won’t you dance with me? I’m asking on my bended knee, oh Yashee hear my plea. Oh, Yashee won’t you dance with me? Oh ask Randy and he’ll agree, oh all we want to see is you dancin’.Ali(singing): I’m Yashee, I’m dancing free, let the world see I'm loving me! I'm proud to be a dancin’ queen, my boys with me, I'm finally free!Goodrich(singing, in sync): Oh, Yashee won’t you dance with me? I’m asking on my bended knee, oh Yashee hear my plea. Oh, Yashee won’t you dance with me? Oh ask Randy and he’ll agree, yeah all we want to see is you dancin’Ali(singing, in sync): I’m Yashee, I’m dancing free, let the world see I'm loving me! I'm proud to be a dancin’ queen, my boys with me, I'm finally free!Goodrich(singing): Oh Yashee, yeah!Ali(singing): I’m free! Loving me!Goodrich(singing): Yeah!Ali(singing): I’m, dancing!Goodrich(singing): Come on, come on Yashee.Ali(singing): Let the world see. All my boys and me, let the world see- I'm loving me.[Song fades out]Kyle: Symbol sits back after ya’ll perform the song. Takes a sip of a drink in a nearby cup holder he has.Kyle(as Symbol): [Contented sigh] That was fresh guys.[Players laugh and say thank you]Kyle(as Symbol): So good.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Look, you’re the one laying down that seventh chord knowledge so-Kyle(as Symbol): Well you know, I didn’t expect the rolls that we had to actually benefit but ya’ll obviously understand the use of a seventh chord- how to vary up a chord itself and give it whole new life, whole new feeling. So man that was- ya'll are turning out alright. I know it started off rocky, I'm sorry I was late that first day-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah what- where were you, man?Kyle(as Symbol): [Sighs] I’ll be honest with you uh, I was late picking up an order of personal treats that were being made by a baker..[someone laughs]Ali(as Yashee): You said you liked treats, that makes sense.Kyle(as Symbol): I didn’t tell Alola- sorry Headmistress Greenspire that. I need to get past that- I need to be better about that.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah that kinda- it hurt a little bit. You know? Our teacher wasn’t there for us.Kyle(as Symbol): What kind of hurt?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Like, you know, we were waiting for our teacher and we were the only people that didn’t have a teacher-Kyle(as Symbol): Oh, yes no that’s.. That's gotta look pretty bad for- well it looked bad for me, and it's got-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): It stung a little.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, I can see that and again I don’t know how many times I can apologize, but I guess that’s why I try and make it up with little gifts here and there-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oooh.Ali(as Yashee): His wonder balls.Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, you know when we did see your wonder balls, it did feel a little bit better.Kyle(as Symbol): I’m- I’m glad you feel that way.[Players chuckles]Kyle: and he’s kind of smirking as you say that-Kyle(as Symbol): Ya’ll know I named them that for a reason right? It’s not just ‘cause there’s amazing things inside. It's hilarious.[Players laugh]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I think we’re gonna get along just fine, Splash.Kyle(as Symbol): It’s Symbol.[Music plays]Ali(singing): All my boys and me! Let the world see, I’m loving me.[Music fades]Transcript by: Gabi Cardone @peachdoodles"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-8-on-the-road-again,Ep. 8 – On the Road Again,"Ep. 8 – On the Road Again [Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed! Last time our adventurers made their way out of the basement and found a sweet dance club before doing so. They spent a few days milling around the school before Symbol hit them up; let them know about their next assignment. They met up with Symbol, got some delicious breakfast- Symbol spilled the beans on what they were gonna go do- they're heading out towards Basom. They stopped by commissary, placed an order with Emma Zahn for some items and then made their way- met up with Symbol and in their travels, they wound up talking a little about seventh chords and jamming down a little bit with Symbol, and breaking free of Yashee’s anxiety over dancing.Goodrich: Hurray!Kyle: Yeah, so let’s go ahead and pick back up there real quick.Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle: You start to settle in for the night, best you can of course being in a carriage. As you’re starting to get ready for bed- everybody give me a perception check.Goodrich: By bed we’re basically just leaning our head back.Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: [Laughs] And going to sleep-Kyle: [Laughs] Yeah pretty much.Spurrier: Like a-Kyle: Like I said, best you can.Spurrier: Because of our travels are we healed up yet? Like, have we had a long rest or not quite-Kyle: Ya’ll had a rest before we started so-[Players and Kyle speaking over each other about being at full health]Kyle: And in this one just let me know if you get higher than your passive perception.Ali: I met my passive perception.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I met my passive too.Kyle: Randy?Spurrier: I passed it, a nineteen plus three.Kyle: Okay, Raz’ul and Yashee- ya'll just hear the mumbling of someone talking. Randy, you hear the driver say-Goodrich: [yelling] Keep it down!Kyle: No, he doesn’t say that![Players laugh]Kyle: You hear the driver say-Kyle(as Mitch): Ma’am are you okay?Kyle: After that point, there isn’t a response to any of the talking you’re hearing outside. Then all the sudden you hear footsteps walk up to the actual carriage and you hear the driver exclaim-Kyle(as Mitch): Dear G-Kyle: But it’s cut short. All the sudden you feel the carriage kind of bounce slightly and you hear a thud hit the ground. A woman’s voice from outside breaks the silence-Kyle(as Woman): Will the well-to-do ma’am or sir please exit the carriage and forfeit anything of value. An expeditious response will secure your driver’s life.Goodrich: I tug on Symbol’s sleeve and I'm like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh, S-symbol uh I think there’s someone outside-Kyle: He just kind of-Kyle(as Symbol): [Tired] Huh?Goodrich: He sleeping?Kyle: He was starting to, he’s like- getting close-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey, hey!Kyle(as Symbol): W-what's going on? Why are we- why are we stopped?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh t-teacher I think maybe- someone outside, we should-Ali(as Yashee): Something going on out there-Kyle(as Woman): [Yelling]Sooner rather than later would be better!Kyle: You hear from the outside; and Symbol’s just like-Kyle(as Symbol): Uh, O..kay I guess let’s see what’s happening.Goodrich: Cause I'm thinking like, I want to see some of Symbol’s chops. You know?Spurrier: Ooh!Goodrich: See what he’s got-Spurrier: Nice.Ali: If there’s anyone well-to-do here it’s probably him.[Players laugh]Ali(as Yashee): I think they need you out there.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, I think someone is calling for you out there Symbol.Spurrier(as Randy): After you, Splash.Kyle(as Symbol): It’s Symbol but..okay, well let’s see what they’re asking for. I'm sure it’s just a standard highway robbing.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Or checkpoint-Kyle(as Symbol): Or checkpoint, yes.Kyle: Symbol starts to open the door and he’s like-Kyle(as Symbol): Lead the way.Goodrich: To us?Kyle: Yeah-Ali: Yashee’s hopping out to check out the scene.Kyle: ‘Kay.Goodrich: Alright, I’ll follow you.Kyle(as Symbol): I want to see how you handle this situation so let’s get out there.Goodrich: I follow Yashee outside-Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I kind of motion over to Randy like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey, get out here.Spurrier: I turn to Symbol and say-Spurrier(as Randy): I did say after you Splash, but fine.Spurrier: And I mosey on out.Kyle: [Chuckles] He kind of chuckles.Goodrich: So, while we’re out there can I roll a stealth check? I want to say something to Yashee and Randy without Symbol hearing.Kyle: Yeah, yeah go ahead and roll a stealth check to see how quiet you tell them.Goodrich: I got a fourteen plus one from jack of all trades, so fifteen.Kyle: Okay, what are you saying?Goodrich: So, I kind of pull you guys close- I guess kind of motion to Yashee.Ali: I’ll bend down.Goodrich: Yeah-Ali(as Yashee): What’s up?Spurrier: I’ll stand on my tip toes.[Players laugh]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey I think this might be one of Symbol’s buds playing a little trick on us. I think he’s maybe testing us to see-[Players agree quietly]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I dunno, that’s kind of the vibe I'm getting from this but..i could be totally wrong, but let’s see where it goes.[Players laugh]Kyle: So you get out of the carriage and form a little huddle while Symbol is getting out. You hear the same female voice exclaim-Kyle(as Woman): Whoa, that’s more than I expected uh, could be a good personal haul for me then. Since there’s four of you then there’s got to be some good treasure on you..wait one second-Kyle: He kind of stops and eyes you down. This figure’s kind of backlit by the setting sun-Goodrich: Oh, nice!Kyle: The one thing you notice is they’re wearing tight fitting clothes and it’s like: black slacks, white shirt, skinny tie and then just a mask. And on the mask, you can barely see this, but it’s just circular eyes and a c shaped nose painted onto the mask. But she’s just standing there and she’s like-Kyle(as Woman): Well this should be a good haul shouldn’t it? Uh- by god is that who I think it is?Kyle: And she kind of gets really giddy, and she starts like hopping around-Kyle(as Woman): Is that- is that my little guy? Is that my little Randall?Kyle: And you recognize the voice as belonging to Rhiannon.Spurrier: And Randy just kind of giggles.Spurrier(as Randy): [High pitched giggle][Players laugh]Spurrier: And goes-Spurrier(as Randy): Oh Rhiannon, you two-faced dog.Kyle: She kind of- she kind of like, saunters up and crouches down real low and she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): Hm, I can’t say that I’m not happy to see you but, I am glad I get to see you one last time.Kyle: She raises up her mask and reveals a half-elf face, dark brown hair which kind of swoops across half of her face covering it. She's like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): You realize that, you made yourself a liability and don’t tell you expected to walk away without repercussions.Spurrier(as Randy): Yeah, I figured that might be the case but you know it was the base choice of action given the circumstances.Kyle(as Rhiannon): I have to say I don’t agree with that, Randall.Goodrich: I’m just looking over at Yashee like, uh?Ali: I just put my hands up like, I don’t know what's going on.Goodrich: Family reunions, right? Yeah.Kyle(as Rhiannon): Well, all I ask is you keep your friends out of this and I’ll do this mercifully. It's the only way you die quick and painlessly I promise.Spurrier(as Randy): Well, I’ll keep my friends in it and I introduce you to Chaos Sauce- with Raz’ul son of Daz’ul, and Yashee Bordun and we’re going to end this mercifully for you. You two-faced son of a-Goodrich: Insert expletive-[All laugh]Spurrier: Insert expletive, I was like yeah I'm gonna catch myself there!Goodrich: Get out of here![Ali laughs]Spurrier(as Randy): You two-faced son of a Nowhere Man.[Players gasp in surprise]Kyle: And when Randy says Nowhere Man, Raz’ul and Yashee you recognize this terminology as belonging to- almost a mythos in ways of being a rogue that has influenced certain areas of culture and, it pops up like almost simultaneously in different spots.Goodrich (imitating The Beatles): All right.Ali: Koo koo kachoo!Kyle: So, the Nowhere Man is essentially like a rouge that has never been caught-Goodrich: Oh! Cool!Kyle: And most people like, are pretty freaked out by meeting the Nowhere Man-Goodrich: But if they meet him wouldn’t they have caught them?Kyle: [Laughs] No not necessarily because they typically die.Goodrich: ..Ah.Kyle: Yeah. So, it’s not a great thing to meet a Nowhere Man and here you have one in front of you based off of the conversation that Randy and Rhiannon just had. So, she kind of- after you insult her she kind of reels back a little bit and stands up and she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): Okay well, you are going to make this difficult. You- you don’t know how hard this is on me, Randall.Spurrier(as Randy): Oh I think I do.Kyle(as Rhiannon): [Sighs] Alright, well then-Kyle: And at that moment she kind of looks behind your shoulder and she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): Who’s setting up a picnic?[Players chuckle]Kyle: And you turn around and you see Symbol just kind of setting out a blanket and you know- [someone laughs] setting up a place for a nice spot to watch.Goodrich: And then Yashee and I are over there too but then we pop back over real quick like, Pokémon style [Pchew] Let’s do this!Ali: I hop up and run on over. I take out my hammers and be like-Ali(as Yashee): Look lady, first thing- it's Randy and second-[Players laugh]Ali(as Yashee): And second, you’re not touching no one here.Kyle(as Rhiannon): I’m afraid you might be wrong on that.Kyle: Let’s go ahead and roll initiative.Spurrier: Pow![Multiple dice rolling]Spurrier: That is a nine plus three, twelve.Goodrich: Five plus nothing!Ali: Nine plus one, ten.Kyle: Okay cool, that’s perfect.Goodrich: What’s the terrain like out here? Is it just like, grassy field or-Kyle: Yeah it’s kind of like grassy field mixed with like some rocky patches cause you’re closer to like the foot hills of mountains and stuff like that. It's kind of a mixture.Goodrich: Oh, okay.Kyle: First up, Rhiannon’s gonna go and with a blinding motion she grabs a quarter staff off her back and whips it around, and Yashee does a sixteen hit you?Ali: Yes.Kyle: Okay, you are caught off guard as a quarter staff swings around and catches you in the side of the head. You're gonna take nine damage and go ahead and give me a constitution save.Ali: [Rolls dice] Okay, that’s gonna be nineteen plus four.Kyle: Okay a nineteen plus four, that’s succeeds. You are spun violently by this knock to the head and you’re almost dizzied and you’re like “oh my god what the heck just hit me?” but then you kind of shake it off and you’re good to go. The next action, Raz’ul does a- let me see here [rolls dice]Goodrich: Does she get to go again?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: Does a fifteen hit?Goodrich: Uh, yeah it hits, mine's twelve.Kyle: So, she swings around- cracks Yashee in the skull and with the opposite end of her quarter staff you take, [rolls dice] eight damage as the quarter staff comes around and hits you with the butt end in the stomach and like kind of knocks the wind out of you. Nothing like, mechanical happens but- and then her last move is going to be [rolls dice] Randy, does a twenty-five hit?Spurrier: A little bit, yeah.Kyle: Mkay, and you are going to take- lemme see here. [Rolls multiple dice] You are going to take fifteen damage as a shuriken is thrown out of nowhere and into your foot. Um, so that imbeds into the top of your foot.Goodrich: Lucky you’ve got that sweet, sweet halfling hair on it.Spurrier: Right?Kyle: [Laughs] Nice protective layer. Then after that she quickly like, slides back about fifteen feet. You know, that anime slide backwards? And has her quarter staff, twirls it and then stands there ready for ya’ll to move. You hear Symbol in the back go-Kyle(as Symbol): Oh, this is going to be interesting to watch!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, you gonna help prof or you just gonna keep chowing down back there?Kyle(as Symbol): I’m just gonna study and see how you handle this. If I need to step in I will.Spurrier(as Randy): Dr. Treats, thanks. Great. Love it. Alright, fine.[Players chuckle]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): We’ll make you proud!Kyle: We’re onto Randy, you’re turn.Spurrier: So Randy turns towards Rhiannon, two-face, and hisses [hiss, players chuckle] cause he’s pissed.Kyle: Sweet.Spurrier: Aaand-Ali: Got him all riled up.Goodrich: Like a golem hiss. [Hisses]Spurrier: Alright so after Randy hisses he turns towards her and says-Spurrier(as Randy): Rhiannon, I think you remember Eddie.Kyle(as Rhiannon): I remember what you took, absolutely.Spurrier: So then Randy lifts up his shirt like he does and I’m gonna cast witch bolt at a third level spell and-Kyle: Okay-Spurrier: And let’s see here uh, if it hits it will be three d12 and then every turn she has to make-Kyle: Three d12!?Spurrier: I know she’s nothing to mess with! [Kyle laughs] Yeah, no crap!Kyle: I just- that's insane, I didn’t- aw man.Spurrier: So Randy lifts up his shirt and says-Spurrier(as Randy): [Distorted] Witch bolt!Kyle: Okay, roll that- it's an attack roll right?Spurrier: Yup. So, that is a nineteen plus three- twenty-two.Kyle: That hits.Spurrier: Hurray! So three d12, and then if I want to- if I want to expend my turn and continue to cast-Kyle: Yeah cause it’s like a constant contact thing-Spurrier: Right- I assume this would be fair, it would only be one d12 even though I cast it at third level. Okay, cool.Kyle: Right.Spurrier: Goodrich and Ali if you want to roll a d12 along with me. [Dice rolls] That is a nine, a two-Ali: Two-Spurrier: And a two.Kyle: Alright-Goodrich: Sorry!Spurrier: That’s alright!Kyle: Nine, two and, two that’s thirteen damage.Spurrier: and Eddie gives her a rude gesture with his hand and then goes back inside of Randy. [Someone laughs]Kyle: As the witch bolt continues to arc from your tummy, you continue to hold up your shirt like- [yells]Spurrier: Screaming.Kyle: Uh- [Spurrier and Kyle mock a high-pitched yell]Spurrier: And to wrap up, Randy is going to back up by fifteen feet to be thirty feet away.Kyle: Okay, excellent. So that’s Randy’s turn, Yashee- you're reeling a little bit from that attack to the head but you get your senses about you. How are you going to proceed?Ali: How close am I to her?Kyle: She is fifteen feet away from you.Ali: Okay, can I take half my turn to get over to her-Kyle: Yes-Ali: And then still attack?Kyle: Yes you can.Ali: Yeah so, I'm just gonna kinda of charge at her and I’ll take out my maul and just try to give her one back that she gave me.Kyle: Absolutely go for it, roll me an attack roll.Ali: Okay so, I got a fourteen plus six and this is a reckless attack that I’m doing which is a barbarian first attack of the turn thing-Kyle: Right-Ali: So, anything melee using a strength modifier I get advantage on.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Okay well, I got a four so fourteen stands.Kyle: Fourteen stands. Alright so, you- go ahead and roll your damage. 2d6 right? Plus strength?Ali: Yes. [Rolls dice] I got a five and a three and my strength so that’d be eight plus three is eleven.Kyle: Alright so, eleven damage. Alright yeah so, you rush up in her spot and bust out your maul, and you just go for like a straight plant in the gut and you bring it right up in there. It catches her pretty good, she’s knocked back just a little but not but enough to be substantial. But she’s knocked back a little bit, kind of [grunts]. And looks at you as you’re doing it and like gives you a wink.Ali(as Yashee): Oh! Uh- uh..Goodrich: Winks as good as a nod, come on back!Spurrier: Say no more!Ali(as Yashee): D-don't wink at me! What are you doing?Kyle(as Rhiannon): Oh, this is going to get fun isn’t it?Ali(as Yashee): [Hesitantly] Uh..Ali: Can I back up? Where’s my-Kyle: You’re gonna provoke an attack of opportunity. Which means she would get an attack roll on you. If you want to back up. Your choice.Ali: Okay, I'll just put my arms up like, ready to block anything she might do to me.Kyle: So, you’re just gonna stay in that melee combat and brace yourself for the worst? Which if that wraps up your round we’re gonna move onto Raz’ul.Goodrich: Okay so, Raz’ul flips his guitar around Sum 41 style and I’m gonna cast thunder wave which is a bard spell so I’m gonna play it here.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: So I look at Rhiannon and say- [singing, playing guitar] You better know it, it’s electric! Boogie-woogie-woogie. You can’t hold it, it’s electric! Boogie-woogie-woogie, but you know it’s there. Thunder wave without a care, yeah. [Music stops] And I was thinking whenever the “It’s electric! Boogie-woogie-woogie, that Yashee and Randy appear from off screen and go, “It’s electric! Boogie-woogie-woogie"" but in an audio medium that doesn’t work.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah, that doesn’t play out.Goodrich: But I’ll sing it so, um-Kyle: I’d also be remiss not to mention that, thunder is not..electricity..Goodrich: Oh no..Kyle: It is..vibration..[Players laugh]Kyle: Sound.Ali: Oh.Kyle: If you want to keep it that’s fine, I'm just letting you know.Goodrich: [Laughing] Does my spell still work?[Players laughter continues]Kyle: No, no it’s gonna work! I’m just saying for the content of what you’re singing for the people listening- they'll be like, oh thunder isn’t like lightening so it’s not electric.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: You know? You do whatever you want man, I'm just- I'm not trying to rain on your parade [chuckles].Ali: Ooh!Kyle: A little on point there. Thunder and lightning- they differ and-Goodrich: Okay, okay!Kyle: And it’s a confusion often made. It pushes them back-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: So, whatever you could do with that-Goodrich: Okay, okay okay! How about instead I do this? [Guitar begins to play, all laugh]Kyle: Yes!Spurrier: Awesome, yeah real good.Goodrich: [Singing] It’s a thunder wave, a thunder wave-Kyle & Goodrich: So, push it real good!Goodrich: [Singing] A thunder wave, a thunder wave-All: So, push it real good![All laugh]Goodrich: Yeah, so that’s what I’m doing! I’ll push her back so-Kyle: Alright so-Goodrich: Let me finally read what thunder wave does!Kyle: I know I need to make a constitution save.Goodrich: Yeah so- so it’s a wave of thunderous force sweeps out from me. Each creature in a fifteen foot cube originating from you needs to make a constitution saving throw. She's fifteen feet away right?Kyle: Yes. Yashee, you need to give me a constitution saving throw.Ali: Oh!Goodrich: Oh, and on a successful save-Kyle: they take half damage.Goodrich: Sorry, Yashee.Ali: That is a ten plus one.Kyle: What’s your spell save DC?Ali & Goodrich: Thirteen.Kyle: Okay, so go ahead and roll your damage.Ali: I do have my arms up in like a-Kyle: He’s behind you-Ali: Oooh! Yashee!Spurrier: [Laughs] Knock you face-first into your mallets.Goodrich: I should next time read what the spells does before I-Ali: Maybe I’ll be pushed hard enough that I can like hit her with all the force of my mallets.Goodrich: [Chuckles] I got a six and a seven, and so that’ll be a thirteen.Kyle: Okay so uh, you bust out your thunder wave spell and play it up and this force of thunder just emits from you and hits Yashee and Rhiannon. And Rhiannon is taken back just a little bit but stays on her feet and slides back only a few inches. Unfortunately, Yashee, not being able to see this you are caught off guard by Raz’ul’s spell and you are pushed ten feet forward. Does it say if it knocks the person prone?Goodrich: No.Kyle: Okay then, Yashee you get pushed ten feet forward passed Rhiannon and you’re essentially- you're behind her now.Ali: Okay-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): That was my plan all along, get you on the other side of her!Kyle: And you take thirteen damage as you are hit by this thunderous wave.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): That..not so much part of the plan!Kyle: So, the spell successful against Yashee; unfortunately, not so much on Rhiannon. Uh, anything else in your turn sir?Goodrich:[Ali laughing] Is there like- is there like an apology spell?[All laugh]Goodrich: I didn’t mean to hurt Yashee!Spurrier: An apology check.Kyle: You have movement available to you at this point.Goodrich: I use my movement to like, slowly put my hand up over my mouth like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Ooh..no..Kyle: Cool!Goodrich: That’s my move.Kyle: Alright, we’re back to Rhiannon’s turn. Randy, at this point you’re standing- you moved back probably thirty feet away from her, probably closer to Symbol than anyone else. But she kind of watches Yashee get pushed passed her and is still reacting to being slid back by Raz’ul’s thunder wave spell but she’s still keeping her eyes on you. And she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): You’re not going to be able to move far enough to get away from me Randall.Kyle: And takes her quarter staff and just jabs it forward and you see like, the air in front of it start to compress. I need you to give me a strength saving throw.Spurrier: Ah, just what little Randy is so good at![All laugh]Spurrier: That is a nine plus nothing, nine.Kyle: And that is not going to pass unfortunately.Spurrier: Ugh..Goodrich: Oh boy.Kyle: Uh so uh-Goodrich: Woof-Spurrier: Meow-Kyle: You’re standing there and you’re like, “Uh I don’t know what’s about to happen.” You haven’t seen Rhiannon manifest this power before but you see the air compress in front of her quarter staff and she juts it at you and there’s this column of air that looks like it’s just traveling right towards you and, hits you square on in the chest. You take fourteen bludgeoning damage.Spurrier: Ugh..Kyle: And it pushes you back- you literally like, fly off the ground. You’re pushed back twenty feet through the air passed Symbol-[someone laughs] and you just like, skid on the ground and you’re left prone.Spurrier: Awesome.Kyle: Now, you’ll have to use half of your movement to get up this next round.Spurrier: ‘Kay-Kyle: Which, speaking of which she’s gonna go ahead and do her next move after jutting that column of air towards you, she’s gonna swing her quarter staff around- Yashee, does a sixteen hit?Ali: Oh yeah!Kyle: Okay, and you’re gonna take..Goodrich: Geez..Ali: Oh, yeah..Kyle: You take twelve damage as she swings the long end around and it winds up cracking you in the back of the head cause you’re still facing away, you haven’t turned around yet. She kind of stands up for a moment and stretches and cracks her neck a little bit, and kind of looks at Raz’ul and she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): Why don’t you play me another one, see how it goes?Goodrich: Wh-Kyle: So- and we’re gonna move on to Randy, your turn. You are prone behind Symbol.Spurrier: How far am I from Symbol?Kyle: You’re about fifteen feet from Symbol, fifty feet away from Rhiannon, and maybe like thirty from Raz’ul.Spurrier: Okay, so if I have twenty-five movement that wouldn’t get me enough to get behind Symbol.Kyle: You could get to Symbol, yeah.Spurrier: Oh Symbol-Kyle: Yeah you’re fifteen feet away to get to Symbol.Spurrier: So, I’m gonna get up and I’m gonna go and hide behind Symbol cause I have my halfling stealthy move.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Since I’m so far away from her I’m just gonna shoot her with my uh, bow.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: That is an eighteen plus six.Kyle: That is going to hit.Spurrier: Awesome! Alright, that’s going to be 1d6 plus three. [Rolls dice] That is a three plus three, six.Kyle: Okay, I’m gonna roll this one in front of ya’ll and we’re gonna see what happens. [Rolls dice] What I got on there?Spurrier: A one! [Ali laughs] Yee haw!Kyle: Okay, so you fire off your short bow and you- you know there’s deadly accuracy behind your shot. But she’s at the point where she whips her quarter staff around to hit Yashee in the back of the head and as the arrow is traveling towards her, you see her hand come up and she just snatches it out of the air right in front of her face at the last moment and she just breaks it. And she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): Randall, Randall are you ever going to learn that that won't work on me?Spurrier(as Randy): It’ll work eventually, you’ll see!Goodrich: Who is this freakin’ tranch man! Get her out of here! [Someone laughs]Kyle(as Rhiannon): Keep on testing me, Randall, I told you it could have been easier.Kyle: Alright and we are going to move on to Yashee, unless Randy anything else?Spurrier: Uh, I guess because I chose to do that the spell is over? I'm out of range too.Kyle: Yeah, yeah the spell would be over, yeah.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Kyle: Yashee?Ali: Alright so, I'm going to use my thunder tap shoes-Kyle: Nice-Ali: And start kind of tapping um, a tasty beat out and aimed at Rhiannon so..[tapping]Goodrich: [Chuckles] You’re like Cab Calloway.Spurrier: Extra, extra.Goodrich: Yeah! Yashee has tap shoes!Kyle: So that’s another thunder wave so that merits a constitution save. Which since she’s not looking at you she actually failed that one so she’s gonna get pushed forward ten feet. Go ahead and roll me your damage.Ali: That would be 2d8. [Rolls dice] So that’s a six and a three.Kyle: Alright, so you start to tap, tap tap tap tap, until it makes a loud clap and this energy just emanates from your feet forward. You can see the ground kicked up and dirt starts to unsettle and everything. As it hits her in the back, she’s pushed forward.Goodrich: You literally tapped up a storm.Ali: There’s [something] on my toes.Kyle: Oooh! And we’re gonna move to Raz’ul, you’re up.Goodrich: So Kyle, Yashee is no longer within fifteen feet of me right?Kyle: No she’s not-Goodrich: And Randy is similar back there?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Not within range? Okay cool. So, I look over at Rhiannon and I kind of grin at her and I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey Yashee? I told you this was all part of my plan right?Goodrich: And I start to- I'm gonna cast thunderwave but I’m gonna cast it as a third level spell.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: So, this time since it’s a third level spell I- [Plays a heavier guitar riff] and we all saaaay-All: Thunderwave! Ahh, aah, aah, thunderwave![Someone laughs]Goodrich: Okay so uh, same deal as last time, but this time- ah, did it- did it hit? I should…Kyle: It hits but the constitution save is what gets it and- different song, this explosive force emanates and catches her off guard and she’s like, puushed back! [Goodrich laughs] And she’s gonna take full damage on that one.Ali: She’s coming back at me now?Kyle: Yeah, she’s heading back in your direction now-Ali: Any chance because she’s coming towards me I can make an opportunity type attack since she’s on her way? Just kind of take my maul and baseball her?Kyle: Uh, no cause she’s not moving like, out of your attack of- yeah-Ali: Well-Kyle: I know I understand, never hurts to ask.Ali: Cause she’s only ten feet away from me.Kyle: The only way you could reach somebody that’s ten feet away from you is if you have like a pole arm, like a quarter staff, halberd or something like of the sorts. Raz’ul’s thunderwave pushed her ten feet back so like, she’s just ping-ponging-Ali: Ping-ponging, yeah.Goodrich: So now when I cast this spell using a spell slot of second level or higher the damage is increased by 1d8 for every slot above first level.Kyle: 3d8 please.Goodrich: It’s 2d8 originally then second level, then third level-Kyle: Oh dang! Okay then yeah, 4d8.Goodrich: Okay three, two, one roll!Spurrier: Go![Multiple dice rolling]Ali: Four-Spurrier: And I got a six.Goodrich: I got a one and a seven.Goodrich: Sooo-Goodrich & Ali: Eighteen!Ali: Nicely done.Kyle: An explosive blast hits her and you can see the mask she was wearing kind of gets blown off by this force and it like, mess up her hair. And you see part of her hair like fly off the part that was covering her face and you can see like, really bad scarring hidden up underneath this and what not. You can tell there was some kind of freak accident. Uh-Goodrich: [Singing] The phantom of the opera is here! [piano begins to play “Phantom of the Opera”]Kyle: But she’s pushed back into Yashee’s space and it is here turn. [Music stops] Now that we’re back at the top of the round. And she’s going to make an attack with her quarter staff again. [Rolls dice] Yashee, does a sixteen hit you?Yashee: Yes.Kyle: Okay, so as she’s sliding back she uses the momentum of being pushed to uh- to get the quarter staff square into your chest. You take-Ali: Noo [groans]Kyle: You wind up taking eight damage as it hits you in the chest and she kind of like, leaps forward a little bit in a very acrobatic manner. This does provoke and attack of opportunity so Yashee, if you’d like to make and attack, you can, you have this opportunity to do that.Ali: Okay then I’m just gonna try to like crack her over the face like-Kyle: Okay-Ali: With my maul.Kyle: Go ahead and roll me an attack roll.Ali: Eleven so that’s plus six, so seventeen.Kyle: That meets so go ahead and- you hit.Spurrier: Nice!Kyle: Go ahead and roll your damage.Ali: Okay!Spurrier: Right on the edge.Kyle: Gotta meet it or beat it-Goodrich: [Singing] Of glory!Kyle: [Sighs]Ali: 2d6 [rolls dice], okay that’s four plus two plus my strength is nine.Kyle: Alright, as she’s stepping forward she gets hit by Yashee and is like- kind of has to do another acrobatics maneuver to kind of stabilize herself but, you see her quarter staff lurch forward and gets the very end of it, whips around and from ten feet away does an attack on Raz’ul. Does a twenty-six hit you?[Players laugh]Kyle: Yes, uh and you take thirteen damage as you- as her quarter staff contacts with the side of your face-Goodrich: I say, ahh! Not in the face!Kyle: That would be the end of her turn-Goodrich: Wait can I do that? Can I say, “Not in the face!”Kyle: Yeah, you say that.Goodrich: But does she still hits me in the face?Kyle: Totally, yeah.Spurrier: Your voice jumps up and octave.[All laughing]Kyle: You say it as it’s coming so there’s no stopping-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Not in the face!Kyle: Not in the fa- [grunts] so that would be the end of Rhiannon’s turn, we’re back to Randy. You're still hiding behind Symbol and he kind of like scoots to the side and looks at you and he’s just like-Kyle(as Symbol): Hey Randy.Spurrier(as Randy): Yees?Kyle(as Symbol): Check out your organ real quick, man.Spurrier(as Randy): [Gasps, in awe] Oooh!Kyle(as Symbol): This might be a learning opportunity for all of us-Spurrier(as Randy): It’s always a learning opportunity.Kyle(as Symbol): Excellent yes, be sure to show some restraint in the words you choose, but get the others on board.Spurrier(as Randy): Alright-Kyle(as Symbol): Look out there, look on the field of battle. You can see the glow coming from Raz’ul guitar, he’s amped it up. Look at Yashee’s mallets, she hasn’t been using them but-Spurrier(as Randy): Ripped, roaring and ready to go?Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, so get out there man.Spurrier: Alright, so Randy steps out from behind Symbol and just holds up his organ above his head-[All laughing]Spurrier: With the light shining and just goes-Spurrier(as Randy): [singing] It’s tiiime!Kyle: Alright, Randy steps out in all of his glory holding his organ up high giving a clear indication of what is about to happen.Goodrich: [Laughing] Randy channels John Cusack with his organ like, above his head?Spurrier: Got my boom box going.Kyle: Mm, nice!Goodrich: Um, yeah so I turn around and I see Randy standing so magnificently with his organ raised and I just..nod.Ali: Like it’s- yes! I look over and I’m like-Ali(as Yashee): Oh, yeah!Ali: Whip out my hammer mallets, put my maul away and I start nodding too. Ali(as Yashee): [Whispering] Let’s do it.Goodrich: I reach down for the volume nob on usumptin and crank it up just a little higher-[Players laugh]Kyle: To eleven?Goodrich: Yeah, to eleven. Of course. [Electronic music plays]Kyle: We got our new little catapults here that we’re gonna use to launch this chord dice. Ya’ll ready to launch?[All agree excitedly]Kyle: Three, two, one. [Multiple dice rolling, instruments make noise as they’re hit]Goodrich: Mine went- man-[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Let’s see so we have-Kyle: C at the beginning and the end-Goodrich: Yeah, we have C and then we have D minor, G, E minor and A minor so it’s uh-Kyle: Wow!Goodrich: It’s on like Donkey Kong-Ali: Lotta options!Kyle: Gonna be a real chord progressional song.Ali: Alright I gotta roll my-Goodrich: Oh yeah-Ali: My drums. Okay [coin hits the table] that’s a tails.Spurrier: So the user-Ali: Let’s see, so my pattern is going to be..eleven, that’s a techno four.[Players chuckle]Ali: Okay, and the kit is..Kyle: Harrington.Ali: Fifty-seven, rock four!Goodrich: Alright!Spurrier: Okay![Players excitedly talk over eachother]Kyle: Rockin’ techno.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone, it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle here just wanted to say thank you for joining us again, we’re always glad to have you back at the table listening.

Later![Music transitions]Spurrier: Okay so, with Randy’s organ all glowing he pulls it down and begins to play.[Electronic keyboard begins to play, joined shortly by drums and guitar]Spurrier(singing): Student, becomes the master; a disaster. Soon you’ll know the sauce is so chaotic; now hypnotic, like a narcotic. When we sing to you-All(singing): No going ba-ack, No going ba-ack, No going ba-ack, No going ba-ack. Rhiannon, you came to rob us, but you can’t stop us. We’ll take that staff and snap it into pieces. Your strength decreases, your effort ceases. When we sing to you no going ba-ack, no going ba-ack, no going ba-ack, no going ba-ack.[Music continues in the background]Kyle: Okay so are you’re casting your musical, magical spell; you notice her eyelids beging to kind of sink and she starts to look really tired and- she goes to take a step back but just can’t seem to lift her foot up. She kind of looks like confused, she kind of shakes her head and looks at her quarter staff and just tosses it at Raz’ul feet. After that she just falls to a pile in the ground, just slumps over and is just like- doodling, drawing something in the dirt on the ground, kind of like looking over at Randy once in a while.Goodrich: I grab her staff.Kyle: Okay. At this point Symbol kind of gets up and he’s walking over and he’s just- [slow clapping, music fades to a stop]Kyle(as Symbol): Alright, alright great job. You seemed to have resolved this in some way and you didn’t just incinerate, mash and destroy something so-Spurrier(as Randy): That would have been fine too but-Kyle(as Symbol): I mean if you think so-Kyle: And Symbol begins talking to you about little things, things that you could have said specifically-Kyle(as Symbol): You did a really good job-[Players thank him]Kyle(as Symbol): There’s things that we could revise so you know like- Yashee, don’t be afraid to tap into the other side of what you know, your barbaric side. You know, you can use that influence in your music and you know- say you wanted to restrain somebody, you could bear hug them-Ali(as Yashee): Oh!Kyle(as Symbol): But with music-Ali(as Yashee): Oh okay, I gotcha.Goodrich: Hug them with the music!Kyle(as Symbol): And Raz’ul, you could introduce some of the nature that you know about and your druidic effects and try to weave that in. You know, bring in your past experiences into your music. Well I mean, that’s just a song writing tip in general.Goodrich: [Laughing] Right.[Players laugh]Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Thanks Splash.Kyle(as Symbol): And these are ways you can improve it, and Randy-Kyle: And Randy as he’s starting to talk to you and explain the benefits and the other ways that you can go about improving your contribution to the ensemble your concentration kind of fades. Normally I’d have Yashee and Raz’ul leave for this but I think I'm gonna have you guys stick around this time.[Players are excitedly shocked]Kyle: So, Randy your concentration starts to fade and you just start to hear a kind of-Kyle(as Unknown): [Groans] Hey, Randy! I can finally stretch my feet a little more now that you’ve been using a little bit more of me uh, no more whispers I can actually talk to ya now. How’ve you been, Randy?Spurrier(as Randy): Uhhm?Kyle(as Eddie): It’s your old buddy Eddie, remember?Spurrier & Goodrich: Oh!Goodrich: What!?Spurrier(as Randy): Now it makes a little more sense.Kyle(as Eddy): Yeah, yeah I've been quiet for a while I know but- man it looks like you got yourself in quite a predicament here. Looks like one of those Nowhere Man kinda got on your tail, huh?Spurrier(as Randy): Uh, yeah but- but I think we’ve got it handled you can just uh, punch out-Kyle(as Eddie): Man, isn’t that the one that uh.. Always called you Randall just to kind of irk you a little bit?Spurrier(as Randy): Yeah a little bit but, you see how she is on the ground. I think I've more than compensated for that-Kyle(as Eddie): Oh Randy, you know these people better than that. You know that this is the opportunity to strike otherwise..they’ll just keep coming. Go ahead and take care of it now. Why even leave a loose end like that? You know you can do it. It’s so easy, you know you’ve got that family dagger, the only thing you have left from what they took from you. Use it. [Forceful] Come on, Randy.Spurrier: And so, naturally I'm trying to fight back against this but uh-I contest!Kyle: Yeah if you’re- go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw real quick.Spurrier: Oh boy, alright! [Sighs]Goodrich: Oh geez..Ali: Be so wise.Goodrich: [Groans distraught]Spurrier: Okay well, that’s a two!Ali: [Groans] No..Kyle: Oh, excellent!Spurrier: Oh..yeah..Goodrich: Is there like a thing like, Ali and I can do as characters? Like, Yashee and Raz’ul- since we’ve been gone do we see anything weird happen?Kyle: No you’re- you’re pretty much paying attention to your teacher-Goodrich: Oh yeah.Kyle: You don’t know that any of this is happening cause it’s all happening inside Randy’s head.Spurrier: And presumably I'm talking in my head, not speaking out.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah no you talk to yourself in your head, that’s why you like kind of faded out. And you know, you’re trying to contest this in your mind and Eddie just says-Kyle(as Eddie): No no no, get this done Randy. Just go ahead and get it done before anybody has a chance to do otherwise.Kyle: Randy, you make your way over to Rhiannon and walk up to her and, as you approach you draw one of your family daggers that you have. And you’re walking up to her and she kind of just looks up, you know, still kind of looking like, frail from the song that you all just cast. She's just looking at you and she’s doodling something on the ground, and you go up and you start to pull the coup de grâce move across her neck. Yashee and Raz’ul, Symbol is talking to you and he stops for a moment and he’s like-Kyle(as Symbol): [Panicked] Randy, what are you doing!?Kyle: And you both turn to look at the same time and you both see like, Randy grabbing Rhiannon by her hair and going to pull a knife across her- and you see Rhiannon’s face kind of like, shake and she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): [Yells] No!Kyle: She puts her hand up between the blade and Randy’s knife and Randy just digs in and cuts through two of her fingers-[Players groan in disgust]Kyle: As they fall to the ground. And she’s able to push Randy back and you kind of come to and realize what you’re doing as there’s blood on your dagger and you see Rhiannon there with like two fingers missing and blood coming from down her hand, and she’s like-Kyle(as Rhiannon): I’m surprised at you, Randall. I can’t believe that you would go this far. You realize that there’s no going back after this. We'll be coming for you.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I mean, you heard the song right?[All laugh]Ali: That’s intense.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): What the heck!Kyle: Everybody- everybody give me a constitution check. [Goodrich laughs][Multiple dice rolling]Ali: I got thirteen plus one, fourteen.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: A four plus one, five.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Seventeen plus one, eighteen.Kyle: Randy you’re sitting there- you're the closest to Rhiannon and she does like, a sweet like, break dance move and gets up and-Goodrich: [Laughing] She break dances to get up!?Kyle: Yeah![Players laughing and talking over each other, amused]Kyle: A little blood like flies out from her hand and what not. She gets up and throws down this device and there’s this blinding light that appears in your face and you are blinded for like a minute. Uh, Raz’ul and Yashee, you see this coming- you’re able to shield your eyes a little bit, and it’s still really blurry but you can catch the faint image of what you can imagine being Rhiannon retreating. By the time your vision comes back to, she’s no where to be found.Goodrich: Are her fingers still there?Ali: Wiggling on the ground..Kyle: Oh yeah, fingers are still there. And Randy’s still on the ground like covering his eyes, screaming as he’s been blinded he’s like, “I can’t see! I can’t see!”Goodrich: That’s-Ali: Let’s head over and check on him.Goodrich: We both run over, I guess?Ali: I’m going.Goodrich: Does Symbol come over too?Kyle: Yes-Ali: I’m like, Randy oh my gosh!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): What the heck, dude! Like-Spurrier: I’m still rolling on the ground like, uncontrollably. Like, I can’t even make speech- kind of in shock.Goodrich: Uh okay, can we roll like a comfort check? Like to calm him down or-Spurrier: I mean is it going to wear off-Kyle: Yeah it’ll wear off. Randy seems unresponsive and he’s kind of just rolling around covering his eyes like- [groans painfully]. And after about a minute of that he finally like, kind of settles down and starts rubbing his eyes and you see like, they are just like pin point- super small. Like, you know, what happens when you see a bright light.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: So they are pin point and they are slowly starting to dilate back out and he kind of like, comes to and he looks at you two in the face and looks down at his dagger and sees the blood on it. And Randy you’re kind of like- it's a little blurry for you as to what just happened. You have an inkling but-Spurrier: Yeah.Spurrier(as Randy): I.. what did I do?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I mean, you just straight up walked over there, man.Ali(as Yashee): Cut her fingers off!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah! It was pretty gnarly-Goodrich: And then I look to my side like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Gasp, shocked] And there they are![Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah you see her fingers lying on the ground.Goodrich: Which fingers?Kyle: Uh, it is the index and middle of her left hand.Goodrich: Oh.Ali: I think I’m gonna pick them up and put them in a little baggy or something.Kyle: Okay, you- go ahead and add two fingers to your inventory.Ali: Sweet!Spurrier: You could pickle that.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Anyway back to you, Randy-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Randy, what the heck![All laugh]Spurrier(as Randy): Yeah, I-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): No, you went over there man and you uh, and you straight looked like you tried to kill her.Spurrier(as Randy): I guess I-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Like, I dunno that’s what I was seeing from where we were.Spurrier(as Randy): I don’t know what I was doing! I- I wasn’t in control of what I was doing.Ali(as Yashee): What do you mean you weren’t in control?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah, dude.Spurrier(as Randy): I..oh, I..we can’t talk about this now.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I mean, I think we should kind of should talk about it now. This is a big deal, man.Ali(as Yashee): If you weren’t in control of yourself then who was?Kyle(as Symbol): It seems like you didn’t have a problem with killing her earlier.Spurrier & Goodrich:..Oh, are you Splash?[All laugh]Kyle: I’m Symbol yeah, yeah! Symbol interjects and he says-Kyle(as Symbol): You know if reference to the song earlier it seems like you didn’t have a problem with offing her.Spurrier(as Randy): That’s true, but I would have liked to choose to kill her if I was gonna do it.Kyle(as Symbol): So you didn’t..choose?..Spurrier(as Randy):..No.Spurrier: And at this point Randy just turns and walks back to the carriage cause he’s just in shock.Goodrich: Okay, I yell after you-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Yelling] You remember Tabitha, man!? You remember when we saw Tabitha, what happened to her? Is that-Spurrier: No- I just keep on walking.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Sighs, yelling] What, you think this is some kind of game!?[All pause and then burst out laughing]Kyle: Aw, damnit Goodrich!Goodrich: So I guess- I um, I turn to Splash-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yo, do you know about this?Kyle(as Symbol): I would know as much as you two do. You know, Randy is a new student to me and I’m not sure what history those two may have had or what may have provoked such a reaction. Um, granted knowing what I know about the Nowhere Man I’d say if you can end an encounter with them dying you’re better off than ninety-nine, maybe a hundred percent of the other people who have encountered them.Ali(as Yashee): It’s true, I’m never opposed to getting a bad guy out of here- taking care of them here.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I mean, I just don’t want it to be one of us, right? I mean, we’re just minding our own business and then-Ali(as Yashee): True.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I know, this is lousy right? Splash, I mean-Kyle(as Symbol): I mean, it’s certainly upsetting to know that one of you may not be in control of yourself at all times.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Mhmmmm.Kyle(as Symbol): But it’s certainly hard to encounter a hurdle like this between band mates so early on.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): What? Drama in a band? Nooo.Kyle(as Symbol): Oh absolutely not-[Players laugh]Kyle(as Symbol): That’s why I toured around as just myself for so long.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oooh! Right, quippy, nice.Kyle(as Symbol): Well regardless I think we should get on and keep moving just to get away from this area. Um, Yashee I saw that you grabbed those fingers. Perhaps good to keep some kind of evidence of any kind of quarrel in this area down in case-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): CSI Beetzart breaks out.Kyle(as Symbol): Well I’m more concerned if Rhiannon tried to return, maybe track down where we were headed after recuperating.Goodrich: Oh.Ali(as Yashee): I was just going to keep them as a souvenir but, I guess if we need them.Kyle(as Symbol): No, I-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Keep your fingers, Yashee. I’m gonna take this staff, hopefully Randy doesn’t mind? Uhhh..Kyle: Okay, you have a- you pick it up, it’s a quarter staff; it has a bunch of little inscriptions on it that you can’t make any sense of.Goodrich: Okay, well-Kyle(as Symbol): If you don’t have any more questions for me I’m gonna get Mitch taken care of.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Mitch?Kyle(as Symbol): Yeah, our driver.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oh!Kyle(as Symbol): You didn’t learn his name?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh no, uh-Kyle(as Symbol): Mitch is great.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I said I have an itch.Kyle(as Symbol): Oh.Kyle: Roll me a deception check![Players laugh]Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Ohh..so uh, five plus three, eight.Kyle: He’s just like-Kyle(as Symbol): If you’ve got an itch, scratch it man. I’m gonna take care of Mitch, get back in the carriage, get nestled in. We're gonna try to, you know, boost it on down the trail; try to get down there a little quicker.Kyle: Randy, how are you in the carriage? You’ve been in the carriage for like a minute or so by yourself as you- give me a perception check real quick, actually.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] Eleven plus three, fourteen.Kyle: Okay, you can hear most of the conversation that goes on so you’re privy to everything that’s been discussed so far, and you can hear Yashee and Raz’ul approaching the carriage door and you know they’re getting back in the carriage-Spurrier: Right before they get in there, I cast sleep on myself.Kyle: Okay, yeah you just- you two walk in and you see Randy, he is just out.Goodrich: Okay, wouldn’t that be nice to have? In like real life?Ali: Yup!Kyle: Okay and as you’re getting settled into the carriage you hear Symbol outside. You know, he addresses Mitch, makes sure he’s all good to go and talks to him for a moment, gets the horses set up then you hear him cast a certain type of spell and gets back into the carriage after casting the spell and is like-Kyle(as Symbol): Okay, go ahead and bed down for the night and we should hopefully get there a little bit quicker than anticipated. Just a little bit of haste on them horses might quicken the journey, especially after what just happened so let’s GTFO, yo.Ali(as Yashee): Yeah, we’re finally on the road back to Basom.Kyle: That’s right, we’ll end it there, thanks for joining again.

PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-10-brawlin-in-the-hall,Ep. 10 – Brawlin' in the Hall,"Ep. 10 – Brawlin' in the Hall[Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed! We’re gonna go ahead and recap last episode real quick for ya. So, our bards woke up believing that had arrived in Basom and they were greeted by the town folk and the town folk were asking for a song in exchange for, you know, our bards being able to see the meteorite- or stone as they called it. After they played their song, they were taken right to Jairah to go see this stone so-Goodrich: And we kind of worked out some feelings.Kyle: Yeah, they definitely had some feelings to work out-Goodrich: Yeaaah-Kyle: And it was a little heavy but um, they worked their way through it and upon arriving to the main temple in this town/[slash] section of ruins they actually got to meet Jairah who told them about, “oh yes we need you to touch the stone, you can contribute to the vision. I want to know what you see.” The bards had a moment- they were kind of reluctant about it and asked their teacher, who is disguised as Leuy Hewis right now, asked if he would get on board with them and find out what’s going on. They all touched this stone and had a vision where they see um- had the red moon Brubeck and they saw the actual appearance of the blue moon that they seen before, which is named Themarcels. [Players laugh].Goodrich: A blue moon called Themarcels?Kyle: Yeah, the blue moon called Themarcels.Goodrich: [Laughing] The Marcels wrote Blue Moon for anyone-[All players understand the concept]Kyle: At the end of the vision you all saw that like, tentacle crawl up and latch around a stone and then you realized that that stone was the same one that you had put your hand on. Of course, Symbol had told you that he didn’t see anything or, didn’t have a vision. You did an insight check to make sure that was the case and you found it to be true. And we ended it up with uh, you guys were kind of remised to kind of mention what you had saw and Jairah, taking offense to this, let you know that Mitch was actually in their possession and that she was ready to kill him if you weren’t gonna dish out the details that you saw. Upon Mitch coming out he let you know like, “guys we’re not really in Basom.” So, we’re gonna pick up there, you just found out that you’re not in Basom and Mitch is being held hostage. So, to paint the picture of where we’re at right now…Kyle: You all are standing about mid-way up to the main podium in this temple area it’s- again it’s lined with pillows and a lot of the people of these ruins are sitting around in lavish fashion. But Jairah is up towards the front where the pedestal is and has Mitch next to her, and that’s where we’re gonna start off.Goodrich: Raz’ul whips out his map and is like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Not Basom? Uh..Kyle: [Goodrich laughs] No, no you have a map that you pull out and you’re looking at it, and you notice that there’s a marking that marks really old ruins in between your route to Basom-Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: So, you’re looking at your map and you pretty much assume that- “ooh, I guess we’re here.”Goodrich: Ooh!Spurrier: It’s not named? On the map?Kyle: No, It's not named-Spurrier: Okay- it's just a- huh.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Weird.Kyle: But yeah, last we left off Jairah was threatening Mitch’s life and saying-Kyle(as Jairah): Listen if you don’t tell me what I need to know then I will end your friends life here. So, perhaps one of you-Kyle: And she’s eyeing down Raz’ul and she’s really looking at him and she’s just like-Kyle(as Jairah): Well maybe one of you could be persuaded to tell me what you saw. Certainly, this wouldn’t be too hard for you to do.Kyle: And she’s really like- she's making a lot of intricate hand gestures while she’s talking to you and looking you down, and I need you to go ahead and give me a wisdom save.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Got a fourteen plus three, seventeen.Kyle: Okay, Raz’ul you start to feel like, “Yeah I think I could get on board with that” then like something I your head is like “wait no, w-what are you- no dude.” and you’re able to shake off this notion and you can tell that she just tried to like charm you.Goodrich: [Sighs] Rude.Spurrier: So, while she’s trying to charm Raz’ul I’m gonna try to hide behind Yashee.Kyle: Okay-Spurrier: Do a little stealth. [Rolls dice] That is a thirteen plus nine.Kyle: So, I got your number for that.Goodrich: So, you said I know she tried to do something wicked to me?Kyle: Yes, you know that she tried to charm you.Goodrich: Then I’ll cast pass without trace as a level 2 druid spell which is-Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: Plus, ten bonus to dexterity checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means, the creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage. So, can I cast that on the three of us plus Splash, plus Mitch?Kyle: Yes-Goodrich: Cause it’s within a thirty-foot-Kyle: Yeah, you’re within fifteen feet of Mitch and Symbol is standing right there next to you.Goodrich: Okay! So, I guess uh, [chuckles] when I cast it can I be like the stone guardians of Atlantis when they come out to defend like-Kyle: [Excited] Yes!Goodrich: When they come out and they clap their hands [clap] and the shield comes up. So- so it’s like, my small stature but I feel so huge!Kyle: Yeah, absolutely.Goodrich: And they come out and I clap my hands [clap] and out comes like this big veil of shadows and I guess- it envelops everybody?Kyle: Yeah, yeah if- it pretty much warps its way into like amoeba like shape to fit the people you want.[All understand]Goodrich: And I say uh-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Man, I'm too slick for those tricks![All laugh]Kyle: So, you cast the spell and Jairah’s just standing up there and she’s like-Kyle(as Jairah): [Irritated] Okay, we’re gonna have to get into this I guess then if you’re going to try and sneak off. Fine.Kyle: And you notice that the people that are sitting on the lush pillows and everything, that are sitting around. They start to stand up and begin to morph and transform into like- they start growing hair on different parts of their body-[Players exclaim in shock and excitement]Kyle: Their ears elongate out, straight up and facing outward-Goodrich: It’s like Pinocchio-Kyle: Almost in a way, but not donkey-ish. Their faces meld forward and they get this little muzzle and everything and they just become a little bit gaunter and shredded but, you notice that their hands turn into claws and their feet turn into large paws, and you notice they look like a mixture between a human and a jackal.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: It’s a jackal!Kyle & Goodrich: Is it a jackal!? It’s a jackal! [Players laughing]Kyle: Is it a jackal!? There's about ten of these people that transform into these jackals around you, including the person who is holding Mitch. You see Jairah and she’s also like-Kyle(as Jairah): [Irritated] Enough of this illusion. If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do this right.Kyle: And Randy, that weight you noticed earlier like, once she starts to say this you notice like an illusion start to drop and you see that the lower half of her body transforms into this large, mountain lion looking figure. Basically, the top half is a human woman and the bottom half is a lion body.Goodrich: Like with four legs?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: [Excited] So it’s like a lion centaur!?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Man, that’s freaking cool!Kyle: Absolutely-Spurrier: [Excited] Uh huh!Kyle: Um, and she says-Kyle(as Jairah): I guess we’ll go ahead and get this started. Feel free to tell me what I need at any point in time if you want to save your life.Kyle: Let’s go ahead and roll initiative.[Multiple dice rolling]Goodrich: I got a five plus zero.Ali: Five plus one.Spurrier: Uh, six plus three.Kyle: Cool, cool, cool [Players laugh]Goodrich: We’re all stealthy, we’re not interested in fighting.Kyle: Okay, first up with got Jairah, she’s gonna start off our combat and she goes over to Mitch and she kind of caresses his face and everything and whispers in his ear. She caresses his cheek and- [rolls dice, whispers] yeah that’s not good.Goodrich: Can he just hide? Cause I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Mitch, hide!Kyle: He tries to run off and hide and like the jackal-were holding the chain like- he gets choked up on it and like, tugged back.Goodrich: So, he just performed a stealth roll and didn’t clear?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: [Disappointed] Oh..Kyle: Mainly because like, he’s bound. He's on like a lead and everything-Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So, it’s a little easier to keep track of him than would be say, Randy or-Goodrich: Right-Kyle: You three if you managed to find like a good hiding spot in this area.Goodrich: Well, nuts! [Laughs]Kyle: Well you know, you can try what you can try and- she caresses Mitch’s cheek and everything and she winds up cutting his binding, and you see his eyes just kind of like glaze over. His hands are free and they go to his side and she sticks a short sword in his hand and she points at you Raz’ul.Goodrich: Uh oh.Ali: Oh no.Kyle: And uh-Spurrier: Oh boy-Goodrich: That’s right, come here Mitch! [claps hands a few times] C’mere! [Spurrier laughs]Kyle: He brandishes-Goodrich: Get away from the mean lady!Kyle: He brandishes the sword and looks at you with intent.Ali: Mitch gon’ give it to ya’.Spurrier: [Surprised] Oh!Kyle: Next up we have our ten jackal-weres, which are pretty much surrounding the four of you including Symbol, and I’m going to-Goodrich: Pillow fight![Players laugh]Kyle: [Chuckles] You wish.Goodrich: Raz’ul yells out.Kyle: Okay so uh, pretty much they break up into like, three on Yashee, three on Symbol, and three on Raz’ul since Randy is hiding behind Yashee and then there’s one holding Mitch of course.Goodrich: We get to see Splash’s chops finally![Players agree enthusiastically]Kyle: He’s supposed to be Leuy Hewis so who-Goodrich: [Disappointed] Aw.Kyle: Who knows if Leuy Hewis can do anything.Goodrich: [Disappointed] Okay.Kyle: I’m just gonna make this quick [rolls dice] five is not gonna hit Yashee, I know that much.Ali: Sweet!Kyle: Then..[whispers] Oh my god, no. Oh god nooo..[speaking normally] So all three of my groups of jackal-weres attempted and missed.Goodrich: So, it was a pillow fight!Kyle: Yeah so, I guess they wound up busting out pillows and not taking it seriously but yeah- that's gonna end their turn since they missed everybody so uh, Randy!Spurrier: Cool! Since I'm hidden I'll make use of doing my sneak attack and I will shoot my short bow at uh, Jairah, right?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay, yeah.Kyle: Go for it.Spurrier: Here we go! [Pauses] That is a thirteen plus six.Kyle: Thirteen plus six? That is going to be a hit.Spurrier: Hurray!Goodrich: Huzzah hurray! Kaloo kalay!Spurrier: Kaloo kalay, Randy!Goodrich: Let Randy chortle in his glory, did Randy chortle in his glory?[Players chuckling]Spurrier: [snorts] Randy snorts in his glory. Uh, so that’s an eight, a three and a six-Kyle: Seventeen.Spurrier: Seventeen plus three, so that’s twenty.Kyle: Dang, yeah. So, you fire off a good bolt and it catches her right under her arm like, basically her arm pit, and it get stuck in deep. You can see her really wince from the pain and part of her like cries out, part of roars a little bit too. Any movement or is that wrapping up your turn Randy?Spurrier: I’m just gonna stay hidden.Kyle: Alright, you’re actually gonna have to do another stealth check.Spurrier: I get that plus ten though?Kyle: Yes, you will.Spurrier: Okay, yeah alright. [Rolls dice] That’s a fifteen plus nine plus ten.Goodrich: [Chuckles] That’ll do it!Kyle: Jeez! Okay!Spurrier: [Laughing] So that’s a thirty-four.Kyle: Suuuure! You're hidden!Spurrier: I’m super hidden, hurray!Kyle: That wraps up Randy’s turn, Yashee you’re up to bat.Ali: Alright, how close are the jackals to me?Kyle: Uh, you have three jackals right in melee combat with you. They have moved up in your biz and are brandishing scimitars.Ali: Okay, since it’s my first attack of the turn I'm gonna use my reckless attack-Kyle: Okay-Ali: Which gives me advantage on melee attacks that use strength.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Are they in a row or are they scattered?Kyle: Pretty much they’re surrounding the group.Ali: Okay, I wanna do like a spin attack where I just use my maul to try to- little helicopter swing, like a little Link. [Goodrich laughs] Link attack.Kyle: GotchaGoodrich: Like the Three Stooges, just hit them all in a row. Doink, doink, doink!Kyle: Let’s roll to see what happens.Ali: Okay, well let’s see. [Rolls dice] Okay-Goodrich: Hurray!Ali: My first one was thirteen plus three so sixteen.Kyle: Mkay, that’s gonna hit.Ali: Oh, okay well great cause my second one was two so-Kyle: Good.Ali: Thirteen plus six so nineteen.Kyle: That hits, go ahead and do your damage.Ali: Sweet! Okay, that’s two d6-Kyle: Okay-Ali: Plus strength. So, that’s six plus five plus my strength which is three so fourteen.Kyle: As you swing your maul around you just clock one of these things in the head and it’s head turns sideways; and I'm going to see how bad you damage this thing [rolls dice] this one is just pretty much going to collapse under the impact of your maul so-[Players laugh joyously]Kyle: Go ahead, if you want to, I’ll let you swing through on one more if you want to roll an attack to see if you get it.Ali: Sure!Goodrich: You got Curly now, he’s the easiest. Next ones Larry-Ali: Is this one at advantage?Kyle: No this one’s not at advantage.Ali: Okay so that’s a seventeen-Goodrich: Heck yeah!Ali: Plus, six.Kyle: Yes, that’s going to hit so go ahead and role me some damage.Ali: Sweet. Okay that’s three plus my strength which is three so six.Kyle: Excellent so yeah, you catch this other one and it doesn’t- you’re losing like the height of your swing. You hit the first one in the head but you’re on the downswing so this one ended up hitting him in the shoulder and you can just see it bunch up like [groans in pain] and it cries out like a yap. But, it’s able to stand sturdy after that hit even though you heard a pretty good crunch on it.Ali: [Excited] Yeah!Kyle: That’s gonna end your turn, Yashee and we are gonna go to Mitch. Mitch is going to uh, make his way towards Raz’ul and attack.Spurrier: Rude.Goodrich: Yeah, what’s his deal?Kyle: [Rolls dice] Mitch is like walking towards you and it looks like he’s just like, dead set on stabbing you and he’s holding the short sword with both hands and just walking in your direction with it.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Careful with that, Mitch!Kyle: And like moves towards you and like tries to jut forward, but winds up tripping on a loose stone in the ground- [Players laugh] and like falling forward and like, hits his head on the ground, kind of looks up and he’s just like-Kyle(as Mitch): W-what's happening? What did I- what did I just do?Goodrich: I extend my hand dramatically to him and I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): She had ya, but you can lean on me Mitch. When you’re not strong- [Players laugh]Kyle: That’ll actually start off your turn, Raz’ul. You give Mitch a helping hand up and you can go ahead and start your turn.Goodrich: So, I- I help Mitch up and then I clap him on the shoulder you know, very eighties movie style and I say.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Welcome back buddy!Goodrich: You know?Kyle(as Mitch): Thanks, man!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Yeah! Heck yeah, dude! Know kind of get behind me-Goodrich: And I put him behind me there.Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: And I’m gonna cast thunder wave. I'm gonna do it as a level two spell-Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: So, I’m gonna say- [singing while playing guitar] I’m gonna be very brave, I'm casting a thunder wave. Raz’ul thunder! [Music stops] So Kyle, do thunder clouds appear in the room?Kyle: Uh, yeah you have a little bit of thunder clouds develop around where you’re picking and around where you’re fretting and everything; and the thunder clouds kind of build up around your hands. It gets a bit of overcast for sure, and then yes, the clap of thunder emits from your instrument. I'm gonna say yeah, you basically can target the three. They have you surrounded in a circle so essentially you’re all covering three different directions to make sure- You're doing the back to back to back thing.Goodrich: Oh ho, nice.Kyle: Yeah, let me roll their constitution check real quick. [Rolls dice] And does- oh, how does a nineteen do?Goodrich: Ooh..my spell save DC is thirteen so..Kyle: So, I guess they’ll still take half damage- so if you want to go ahead and roll that damage.Goodrich: [Rolls dice, whispers] Oops, eleven.Kyle: Eleven damage, so they’ll take half rounded down. Alright they’re not all pushed back however, the direction you’re facing- your thunder wave uh, emits from your hands and flies past them. They braced themselves and take the full brunt of the force. The pillows that are behind them however, fly up in a flurry-Goodrich: [Excited] Heck yeah!Kyle: And whatnot and tossed every which way.Goodrich: Do they explode and there’s feathers everywhere!?Kyle: Yeah totally- [Players laugh, and talk about the scene excitedly] They just get ripped apart right in half and there’s feathers that fly up. Give me a perception check with advantage real quick, Raz’ul.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Seven. [Rolls dice again] Twelve plus three is fifteen.Kyle: Mkay so, with your experience being a dwarf and knowing stone and everything. You can see past where these pillows have been shredded up and thrown up from your thunder wave- you see through the feathers and whatnot and you notice that the corner stone, where the wall meets the other wall-Goodrich: Yeah?Kyle: That corner stone. Looks really weak there’s a big crack in it and it looks like the structural integrity of this building is not the best.Goodrich: Alright!Kyle: Alright so it’s Symbols turn and-[Players cheer loudly]Kyle: [Laughs] He is going to um-Goodrich: Let’s go Splash!Kyle: He is going to- [chuckles] he is going to bust out a pair of recorders and he begins to play them, and from the ends of these recorders a blob of color and like shapes spit out of it and move their way over to the jackal that was- that's standing next to Jairah that was holding the lead for Mitch, and you see the blob expand in a hypnotic pattern. You can see this jackal-were just kind of become enraptured by this vision and you see him like go for his dagger and just stab at Jairah.[Players laugh and gasp surprised]Kyle: And-Ali: Go jackal!Kyle: Catches her off guard and catches her right in the side, and you can see her she’s like furious from this reaction, she didn’t see it coming. And she’s like looking at him, swearing him up and down and everything. That'll wrap up Symbol’s turn and we’re gonna go back to the top with Jairah who is super pissed!Goodrich: Aw.Spurrier: [Laughs]Kyle: And uh, she’s is just going to outright claw at this jackal-were. [Rolls dice] And she straight up drops him- [players laugh in surprise] like, she just swiped with one of her giant lion paws. She rears back and just slaps the crap out of him and yeah, you see his flesh rend and everything and like, he winds up just collapsing to the ground and he is out.Goodrich: Oooh, mark one down for Splash![Players laugh]Kyle: But um, she is going to turn and she is going to say-Kyle(as Jairah): [Annoyed] Okay, this is becoming quite inconvenient for me so..Kyle: Raz’ul, she looks at you and she begins to weave an incantation and you hear something like, speaking in the back of your mind and telling you to do something. So, go ahead and-Goodrich: Freakin’ Eddie!?Spurrier: Now you know what it feels like![All laugh loudly]Kyle: Go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Got a nine plus three, twelve.Kyle: Twelve? Um, the voice in the back of your head gets louder as it begins to tell you-Kyle(as Jairah): [Echoing] Why don’t you uh, why don’t you attack your half orc friend there? That’s what I want you to do next.Kyle: So-Goodrich: Do I have to?Kyle: Yes, you have to because you have succumbed to a suggestion spell. Next turn if you-Goodrich: But it’s not my turn is it?Kyle: It’s not your turn, but on your next turn you will be forced to. It is to the jackal-weres and I’m gonna go ahead and do the attacks on Yashee, there’s only two on you since you dropped one. [Muttering as dice rolls] So, they’re gonna roll at advantage..that‘s not good for him- [rolls dice] that’s not good either, and then- [rolls dice, normal speaking volume] oof, bad dice! Bad dice! Okay, yeah so uh they miss you completely Yashee. They're really trying to like-Ali: Oh man, really!? Even with their advantage?Kyle: Yeah, even with their advantage they’re missing and uh, Raz’ul the ones that you tried to blow back are getting up on you and..does a fifteen hit you?Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: The other two wind up missing but one of them is able to get a successful attack on you. It brings its scimitar down, hits you and winds up doing [rolls dice] five damage as it slices into your dwarfy flesh.Goodrich: Aw- no, it slices into my dwarfy studded leather armor, right?Kyle: It found past the armor.Goodrich: [Disappointed] Aw.Kyle: Yeah. Then we have the one that’s going to try to attack Symbol. [Rolling multiple dies] Okay..that’s not gonna hit him. Okay, and they all- man, jeez! Okay, I’m trading my dice out after this round.Spurrier: They’re not were-jackals they’re errr-jackals!Kyle: Yeah they’re errr-jackals!Goodrich: Errr-jackals![All laugh]Kyle: Missing all over the place- Okay so- so yeah, the jackals all go through their turn only two of them able to make any kind of- actually one of them only making any kind of hit. Goodrich: Well they’re trained in pillow fighting you can’t really blame them.Kyle: Yeah hm, my dice are just treating me bad. So, we’re to Randy, it is your turn.Spurrier: We’re all back to back to back you said?Kyle: You’re making like a little triangle to see all directions in this big room.Spurrier: And I would have no idea what Raz’ul’s about to do right?Kyle: You wouldn’t, no.Spurrier: Okay cool.Goodrich: How's it feel?[All laugh]Spurrier: Sad!Goodrich: It is sad, isn’t it?Spurrier: [Chuckles] Okay, if I was to try to deploy something because of the spell that Raz’ul cast would I be able to do it in a like, stealthful way? That the creatures wouldn’t notice something that I've deployed?Kyle: What are you trying to deploy?Spurrier: The hole that I have.Kyle: Oh, yeah-Spurrier: The portable hole-Kyle: You can roll a sleight of hand and I’ll let you have that bonus to it if you want to do that.Spurrier: Is Jairah big enough to fit in it?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay cool then yeah, I'd like to deploy that in front of us I guess, in between us and her.Kyle: Okay, so go ahead and give me that sleight of hand check real quick and you can add that plus ten bonus to it.Spurrier: Yes! [Rolls dice] So that’s eighteen plus six plus ten, so that’s thirty-four.Kyle: Thirty-four! Okay, so you grab this thing and you like unfold it enough to where you can like slap it out and you’re like, Christopher Lloyd in Roger Rabbit where he just-[Players laughing]Kyle: Throws that black circle onto the ground-Spurrier: That’s exactly what I want it to be, yeah-Kyle: And it lands perfectly-Spurrier: Instead of a standard action could I do the persuasion check and also stealth so I can go back into hiding?Kyle: Yeah, cause you can do the bonus action stuff.Spurrier: Okay, cool!Kyle: So yeah go for it.Spurrier: So, I'm gonna try to persuade her- [rolls dice] Okay, so that’s a seventeen plus six.Kyle: [Amused] Yeah you can tell- you pop out from behind Yashee’s leg and whatnot and you’re just kind of like, gesturing- Spurrier: Hey, hey Jairah get on over! Come on over!Goodriching: [Laughing] What?Kyle: And she kind of looks- she kind of like- she's just finished swiping down her own jackal-were and she’s like, looking at you and she’s kind of like, a little intrigued-Spurrier: Awesome.Kyle: You know, she kind of has like a half smirk on her face and shakes her body a little bit and she starts to like, turn her direction towards you.Players: [Singing to the tune of “Karma Chameleon”] C’mon, c’mon, c’mon, c’mon, c’mon come Jairah. Spurrier(as Randy): I bet you can’t find me!Spurrier: So yeah, I'm gonna taunt her and say she can’t find me, I'm gonna go back into hiding.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] Seventeen- seventeen plus nine plus ten, so that’s a thirty-six. So hopefully even with her being aware of me I can [starts laughing] still hide.Kyle: That spell is insane. Alright so that’ll uh- and you got a thirty-four on that, jeez.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Right okay, so that’ll end up Randy’s turn and we are to Yashee.Ali: Okay, so I'm thinking um, how far behind the jackals is that hole?Kyle: It’s probably about like five feet behind them.Ali: And how big is the hole?Kyle: Uh, it is a six by six-foot hole, right?Spurrier: And ten feet deep, it’s a six-foot circle.Ali: Okay, I don’t want to mess up what you’re doing with Jairah but I kind of want to use thunder wave to just push them down-Spurrier: There’s probably room for both-Ali: Into it but I don’t- okay. So, I'm gonna slip on my tap shoes.Kyle: Let’s just say you already have them on.Ali: Okay, and I’m gonna start tapping out my thunder wave.Kyle: Okay.Ali: In hopes of knocking them back into the hole since-Kyle: So, you have two that are up on you so I'm gonna make constitutions for both. [Rolls dice] How do tens do?Ali: Thirteen.Kyle: Okay, well that is successful-Goodrich: Yay!Kyle: So, go ahead and roll damage and they will be pushed back ten feet. One of them gets knocked completely off their feet and flies backwards into the hole. The second one gets blown back to the edge and it like, tries to catch it’s balance a little but, it ends up falling back and you can just hear the thud as it falls into the hole. Um, and-Goodrich: He’s just Fred A-staring at the ceiling![All laugh and “ooh”]Kyle: [Sighs] Yeah, he is. Okay, and also another effect of this thunder wave you’ve cast- you notice around you after the echoing subsides you can see like dust and dirt falling from the ceiling and whatnot and like the buildings kind of shaking and moving. You're reminded again, you can see that like the structure is not looking very good.Goodrich: Chaos Sauce bringing the house down!Kyle: Alright, that blows back those two so we’re pretty much to there being six for you all to encounter plus Jairah. And, we are going to move to Mitch’s turn-[Players cheer]Kyle: And Mitch- Mitch is gonna clap Raz’ul on the back and be like-Kyle(as Mitch): [Confidently] Thanks again man, I think I can handle this.Kyle: And he goes for one of the ones that’s near Raz’ul trying to give him a hand. [Rolls dice] And... [silence, and then a bit of laughter]. What a Mitch! He missed.Goodrich: He Mitched!Kyle: He stabs forward and is like- [weak grunt] you guys can tell that fighting is not his thing. Uh-Goodrich: Classic Mitch.Kyle: Probably more comfortable behind a horse. So, that’s Mitch’s turn and Raz’ul you’re up. Go ahead and roll your attack on Yashee.Goodrich: Uh-oh.Ali: Oh, right!Goodrich: Yeah, so do I choose what I do or what?Kyle: You just melee attack.Goodrich: Okay [chuckles]Kyle: Use your axe.Goodrich: Can’t I just slap fight her like- [weak grunt]Kyle: Nope! No, you’re gonna use your weapon.Goodrich: [Sighs] Okay.. [Rolls dice] So I got a thirteen plus three, sixteen.Kyle: Does that hit, Yashee?Ali: [Softly] Yeah.Goodrich: [Sadly] Oh..Spurrier: Oh no.Kyle: Roll your damage on Yashee.Spurrier: Jeez, so rude.Goodrich: Oh no, and I have the capo attached! So, I have a twenty percent chance of getting a head shot.Kyle: [Mumbling] Okay, yeah..Ali: I dunno, I mean like.. Goodrich: I dunno what-Ali: I’m like really tall!Goodrich: That’s true, is that a thing?Kyle: Nah, I'd say you can reach with the length of your weapon and the length of your arms.[Players discussing and laughing over each other]Kyle: So, I'm gonna roll. If it gets a twenty or below, you’ll have hit her in the head. [Rolls dice]Ali: Thank you, sixty-two.Goodrich: Hurray!Kyle: So just a regular attack.Goodrich: [Rolls dice, awes] Seven!Ali: Seven!Spurrier: Plus, three.Kyle: Plus three, so you take ten damage. You just feel an axe hit you in the back and you hear- you hear as it sinks into you the vibrations of Raz’ul’s guitar like, [guitar chords are hit].Goodrich: Is it a sad vibration in a minor chord?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Sad, sad, sad, sad vibrations.Ali: I’m gonna turn around holding my back and I'm like-Ali(as Yashee): [Yells] Dude, what are you doing!?Kyle: You look at Raz’ul and you can see there’s kind of a blank stare on his face as he’s just holding his weapon, he’s just eyeing you down. One of his eyes is almost like twitching in a way and he’s just looking at you and he’s like, [grunts].Ali: Can I just um, grab his axe and hold him up? [Players laugh]Kyle: It’s not your turn.Ali: Oh.Kyle: We’re gonna go to Symbol’s turn, and Symbol is going to- having seen Raz’ul attack Yashee he’s going to like-Kyle(as Symbol): Raz’ul, w-what are you- oh sorry, I'm supposed to be- [with a New York, Boston accent] Raz’ul what are you doing? I can’t believe you would do something like-Kyle: And he gets a glimpse of you he’s just like-Kyle(as Symbol): Oh, okay okay I see what’s happening here.Kyle: He directs his sights towards Jairah and you see him just- he pulls out this bow from that little bag that he had before, reaches in elbow deep, pulls out a bow and like knocks up and just like fires-Goodrich: Strings up a violin?Kyle: No, he knocks up his bow and-[Kyle and Goodrich chuckle]Kyle: He knocks it up and fires off at Jairah and- [rolls dice] that is going to hit.[Players cheer]Kyle: Alright so he knocks up the bow and uh, fires off at Jairah and the arrow just flies through the air and punctures right below her left shoulder and she kind of knocks back. You see her like, wince from the pain, you see her like hold her head for a moment, and Raz’ul you have a moment of clarity as you’re pulling your axe out of Yashee’s back, pulling back you’re like, “What did I just do!?” You kind of come to and you kind of have your wits about you again as you realize what’s going on and you see Jairah holding her head. So, that is going to end Symbol’s-Goodrich: Can I say sorry? I- sorry-Kyle: You can, yes.Goodrich: Can I say sorry, Yashee?Ali: You can.Goodrich: I guess I should. [Laughs, mockingly] I dunno, can you!? Yeah, I say-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Singing] I never meant to hurt you, Yashee.Ali(as Yashee): I mean, you like axed me in the back.Goodrich: Aw.Ali(as Yashee): It’ll be alright.Goodrich: Et tu, Raz’ul?[All laugh]Kyle: Alright, so we’re back to the top of the action it is Jairah’s turn. She is looking pretty fierce, she’s trying to like look for Randy around where he last hid-Spurrier(as Randy): Come find me!Kyle: And uh, she’s kind of like in a little bit of a rage and she’s like walking forward and let’s see if she notices the pit [rolls dice].Spurrier: No.Kyle: She does not!Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: She does not notice the pit and she just happens to step right into it. Let’s see a dex save, [rolls dice, players laugh] nope! So, a dex save and she is fallen in the pit for right now.[Players cheer]Goodrich: Close it, close it!Ali: Fold her up!Kyle: And that is going to end her turn so let’s go with the jackal-weres.Goodrich: [Groans] These guys.Kyle: Yashee you see one of the jackal-weres that you knocked back into the pit. You see his arms come up and he’s like scrambling to pull himself up. He pulls himself up and he like gets up to his feet and he looks pretty exhausted, he’s just like [breathes heavily]. But he’s staring you down and he’s got his sword ready to go, and Raz’ul you have the jackal-weres that are attacking you. [Rolls dice] Mhm does a fourteen hit, Raz’ul?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Cool, [rolls dice] alright-Goodrich: Oh no!Kyle: So uh, you actually get hit by two of these jackal-weres with their scimitars-Goodrich: At the same time?Kyle: Yeah, they both get you so you take seven damage from one and three damage from the other for a total of ten damage. That's the round from those, and then I'm gonna get the ones who are gonna attack Symbol. [Rolls multiple dice] Yes, yes. Okay so two of them wind up hitting Symbol and uh, [rolls dice] alright. So yeah, they both slice into Symbol really well as he like- coming back from pulling down his hands from firing off at Jairah they get a really good hit on him. You see he takes a couple hits and he winces and he’s just like, “aw dang, caught me in the side.” And that is going to take us to Randy’s turn.Spurrier: I was going to do another sleight of hand to go get my hole back.Kyle: Mkay, so to do that you’re going to have to move past the jackals that are in the nearby vicinity. Moving that directions is going to provoke and attack of opportunity.Spurrier: Hmm, can I do a stealth check over to the hole?Kyle: Yes you can, go for it.Spurrier: Cool! [Rolls dice] That is a twelve plus nine plus ten, [chuckles] that’s a thirty-one.Kyle: [Sighs] Okay yeah, you get there.[Players laugh]Goodrich: I’m using this spell all the time!Spurrier: Yeah, right?Goodrich: This spells great!Spurrier: Okay, then I guess I’ll do a sleight of hand to get the-Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] So then that is, two plus six plus ten so that’s eighteen.Kyle: Okay, yeah you get it all folded up and that’s pretty much your action is getting it to the folded state.Spurrier: And as far as we know there’s no magical means of keeping it closed? Just the act of closing it itself is cool or?Kyle: Yeah, all you can do is fold it up.Spurrier: As far as we know, things can’t get out that are folded up in it?Kyle: You don’t know that.Spurrier: We don’t know that? Okay, cool that’s what I thought. Um-Goodrich: Are you gonna use a bonus action to tie it up?Spurrier: Well yeah, I was trying to think if I had a way of doing anything like that. Okay, I know what I’m gonna do! Are any of the like downed jackals by me? Like the ones that have been beaten?Kyle: Yeah, there is one.Spurrier: Okay, then I'd like to try to stick the hole underneath that jackal.Goodrich: Stick it underneath-Kyle: Tuck it underneath?Spurrier: Yeah-Kyle: Okay-Ali: Like a reverse table cloth.Spurrier: Yeah, exactly.Kyle: Hm, okay! Yeah, I say you do that no problem. As you are folding up the portable hole you saw Jairah in there and a dead jackal-were, and Jairah like tried to jump up but you were able to close it up-Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: You felt like the pulse of the actual cloth like, hit up but you were able to fold it up, hold it down-Spurrier: I just give it a little smack.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Down! Goodrich: Like, Jumanji.Kyle: Yeah, exactly! And we are going to go to Yashee, it is your turn.Ali: Okay so how close is that jackal that crawled out of the hole?Kyle: He’s in melee range with you, he’s like five feet away.Ali: Okay, I'm going to rage.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Just for fun. Um, I don’t realize that the- I havent been paying attention, I've been focused on him so much that I didn’t realize the holes been put away, and so I take out my maul and kind of get ready to check him and I go-Ali(as Yashee): [In a deeper voice] I am raging![Players laugh]Ali: And I try to check him into the hole-Kyle: [Chuckles] Nice.Ali: That’s not there anymore.Kyle: Go ahead and give me an attack roll.Ali: [Rolls dice] A three plus six, nine.Kyle: Okay, you go to butt this guy but he’s able to duck under your cross bar that you’re using your maul for, jukes around you and-Ali: I’m gonna blame this on the uh, slit in my back [giggles].Goodrich: That’s fair, that’s fair.Kyle: That’s fair! So, it’s Mitch’s turn and he kind of looks at Raz’ul and he’s like-Kyle(as Mitch): [Surprised] What are you doing man? That was- What the heck was that?Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I was bewitched, didn’t you see her wrinkle her nose? She got me, man![All laugh as Goodrich hums Bewitched tv show theme]Kyle(as Mitch): Interesting, that-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): I’m good now, I'm good.Kyle(as Mitch): That’s good, you might want to check out your instrument it’s looking a little weird. It's shedding a little bit of light there.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Surprised gasp][All imitate the gasp, laughter]Kyle: As he’s saying that he’s attacking one of the jackal-weres and- [rolls dice then gasps] Yes! [rolls another dice]. Okay and like, he’s looking at you and just like stabs randomly.[Players laugh]Kyle: [Mumbles] And then that’s-Goodrich: It’s like he’s a savant and he just suddenly turns and is like, [imitates sound of a sword thrusting].[Players agree]Kyle: He’s just looking at you says that and juts is sword forward and catches one right through the chest to the heart. It just like collapses on his blade and he just looks back and is like-Kyle(as Mitch): Whoa! Cool!Kyle: So that is going to end Mitch’s turn, Raz’ul, your turn.Goodrich: Okay, so I look down at Usumptin and I say.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Whoa, whoa it’s okay, it’s okay.Goodrich: And Kyle, I noticed from my passive perception that Jairah’s missing from the action, right?Kyle: You notice that she’s not in the room, you don’t know where she is though.Goodrich: [Surprised] Oh! Uh-Kyle: Cause, you didn’t see what happened to her-Goodrich: Right, can I yell out? Hey! Where's the beef? Er- [All laugh] Where’s Jairah?Kyle: Yeah, yeah you can say something as part of your turn.Goodrich: So, I go to Randy and say, hey where’s the cream filling? No, I say- I say where’s Jairah? Okay, that’s what I say.Kyle: What happened to Jairah!?Goodrich: Where’d she go!?Spurrier: Am I allowed to respond even though it’s not my turn?Kyle: Uh, yeah you can go ahead and respond.Spurrier: Okay, Randy just giggles and points down at the jackal that’s dead-Goodrich(as Raz’ul) Okay?Ali(as Yashee): She’s the jackal?Spurrier(as Randy): Underneath. The hole. She's in the hole.Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Oooh!Spurrier(as Randy): Yeah, she’s folded up for now, she’s fine.Goodrich: When Randy says that, I can understand that she’s in the hold folded up because we played the prank on Yashee. I know that’s how it works.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay, and do I see the hole underneath the dead jackal?Kyle: No, because it’s tucked underneath a jackal.Goodrich: Okay, can I go over to there?Kyle: Yeah, if you want to move over in that direction you would provoke an attack of opportunity though.Goodrich: But when I get there, I can do what I wanna do? It's not an attack or a spell or anything.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: [Rolls dice] A fifteen does hit.Goodrich: Yeah, yeah.Kyle: So.. [rolls dice] you take a total of eight damage as you’re hit by both of the jackal-weres that are still taken up with you and Mitch, but you’re able to make your movement over the jackal that’s lying on the ground and has the portable hole underneath him.Goodrich: So, I get over to the dead jackal and I kind of rustle around- and I find the hole right?Kyle: Yes-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: You find the hole underneath his body-Goodrich: Okay, so I whip out my needle that never bends- which is, you know, I’ve had with me- and Kyle I know that this is a needle that doesn’t bend-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: It’s not liked a needle I had with me-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: I haven’t known its magical properties? Okay.Kyle: For sure, you found it and you were just like, “whoa!”[Players “whoa!” along with Kyle]Goodrich: So yeah, I wanna like fold over the corners and like thread it with this needle that never bends so that, you know, it never bends and the thing will never open again.Kyle: So Raz’ul you go to pin the portable hole closed using your unbending needle and as you pierce the cloth there’s an instant explosion that sends you flying back. Yashee and Randy-Goodrich: [distancing himself from the mic] No regrets![All laugh]Kyle: Yashee and Randy, you see this happen and the explosion is a swirling mass of black and blue energy that seems to consume your concentration; and in the blink of an eye you three are standing alone in a black void. You see nothing, and can hear nothing but the beating of your own hearts. A sense of dread washes over you as you notice a set of gray eyes peering at you, constantly affixed in your peripheral. A semi-familiar voice fills the void.Kyle(as Unknown): [deep and echoing voice filled with mystery and slight malice] I did not think an opportunity like this would arise without my servant, but here we are. I should thank you for creating this bridge but now that I have you, you will show me what you would not before. [Inhales sharply] You stink of them, a pungent odor offensive to the senses which makes me curious. Can you create? Are your abilities inferior? Or can you breathe life as well? Show me and I will return you. Do not and remain here forever. There are no other terms.Kyle: The voice echoes throughout the void and you see three pillars of dark matter rise in front of you. Your instruments are removed from their holsters and they begin to float in front of you. Let’s roll some chord dice.[Players laugh nervously but with excitement][Electronic music plays]Kyle: Hey! So-Goodrich: Yeah, hey! [imitates a horn]Kyle: Having a good time, right?Goodrich: Okay..[multiple dice rolls against a surface] C, B diminished-Ali: Oh we gotta roll again, is that a re-roll? [mumbles] That one's yours. [Rolls dice, laughs]Goodrich: Another re-roll. Come on, Kyle jeez. [Dice rolls] A minor-Ali: Alright!Goodrich: Alright so C, B, G diminished and A minor.Ali: Awesome.Kyle: That’s not bad, let’s see what you guys do with this.Ali: We always forget-Goodrich: We always forget to do this.Ali: We gots to get some drums going, it’s okay. [Sound of coin hitting surface] Alright..Goodrich: Hey, you know what else I realized? We have never once called this a drum roll.[All laugh]Ali: Aw, no!Goodrich: Drum roll, please!Ali: Oops!Goodrich: Oops is right.Ali: No better time than the present [rolls dice].Goodrich: Better time than this terrifying situation we find ourselves in.Ali: Alright so we’ll start with rock twenty-six as our pattern-Goodrich: Alright.Ali: And sixty-nine!Goodrich: Sixty-nine!Kyle: That’s a good one!Ali: As rock sixteen, it’s gonna be a very rocking event.Goodrich: I guess.Kyle: Alright yeah, I'm gonna let them go- let them go write this song while I'll talk to ya’ll in a second.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle and again I just wanted to say thank you for listening and for hanging out with us.

Later![Music transitions]Goodrich: Raz’ul kind of looks around and is like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Uh, who is this dude? Who’s he jiving with this cosmic debris he’s got here? I don’t..[chuckles] I don’t know.Ali: Yashee’s honestly too scared to move.Goodrich: Aw.Ali: She’s having a melt down over here.Goodrich: Okay well I got over and I’m like-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Hey it’s okay we’re- we’re gonna get out of this-Ali(as Yashee): [Terrified] I don’t know-Goodrich(as Raz’ul): Don’t worry-Ali(as Yashee): [Terrifed] I don’t know what’s going on..it’s very dark and creepy in here.Spurrier: Well, even though it’s way more intense than the past stuff that Randy’s dealt with, given this whole Eddie craziness he’s been in. I think he’s feeling a bit more up to the task and heads over to his organ.Kyle: Okay, do you grab your organ?Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: Okay, when you grab your organ the runes on it light up with a dazzling light that you haven’t seen yet. It’s just like pulsating and almost overflowing with this energy.Spurrier: Well in that case I’m gonna start playing.[Piano begins to play a calmly melody]Spurrier(singing): I think we’ve gotta play, Gotta play our way out of this place. Or be trapped in space. [Guitar starts to follow along]Goodrich (singing): But where are we? And who is this? And what are we gonna play now? A melody, to remedy the challenge from this enemy. Spurrier & Goodrich(singing): So Yashee, how ya feel? Are you ready to go? It’s getting real. [Drums pick up and all play together]Ali(singing): I think I’m starting to see the light. If you’re both with me I’ll be all right. This cannot be our end. Our music will transcend, and lead us to our destiny. We are each other's remedy. Any fight we come across, we can defeat as Chaos Sauce! Goodrich: one, two, three![More upbeat]All(singing): So we’ll take this matter, and we’ll make it a door, cause we’ve got lives worth living for. And if you haven’t heard, well that’s your loss, ‘cause these three bards are Chaos Sauce! Chaos Sauce! (x8)[Music ends]Kyle: Okay so as you play, wisps of magic begin to form and swirl in front of you and they form into three individual orbs. They pulsate and grow and try to form together but there’s some kind of barrier that seems to keep them separated. As the song comes to a close the orbs speed towards the pillars and you imagine that they’re going to be creating a door. They burrow slowly into them; the pillars collapse into a pool of viscous liquid and begin to thrash violently. You hear the voice fill the void again-Kyle(as Unknown): So you can’t create like them. Fortunately, I can and I'm very excited to work with this energy.Kyle: Three figures begin to slowly emerge from the thrashing liquid, resulting in humanoid shapes. Each of them mirroring one of you. You look at these things made of dark material and all the sudden their eyes open, and as soon as they do, you’re back in the temple. The explosion continues and then it draws back in, sucking in everything around it, pulling in rocks from above you and you realize.. You need to leave this temple now.Goodrich: Probably because we just created a black hole in Beetzart!Spurrier: Nicely done!Kyle: Nicely done! Yeah, so this thing it-Goodrich: Raz’ul just aced his physics test!Kyle: It slowly catches onto these tethers and slowly sucks back into itself. The feathers from the pillows from nearby are starting to get sucked in, the dead jackal-were that’s nearby that you moved is just sucked in and drawn in to it. A slab falls from the ceiling and lands right on top of it. You see the slab get crunched down over a small period of time, just gets like sucked into it. Eventually that slab disappears. A stone around it starts to come up out of the ground and be like, forced into it. You notice corner stones- especially the corner stone that was weak earlier- Raz'ul, you notice that’s starting to shake and move and slide out from its positioning. The jackal-weres immediately like, seeing this happen- they flee and they run out of the temple. Symbol is looking at you three and is like-Kyle(as Symbol): We gotta get out of here, we gotta go now! Uh, this is turning really bad! Especially whatever you just did to that extra dimensional portable hole![Players chuckle]Kyle: Uh, so-Spurrier: So, I presume we don’t have the hole anymore?Kyle: No.Spurrier: Oh, sad day.Goodrich: All we have is this beautiful universe it’s about to create once the implosion is done [laughs].Ali: How high up are we?Kyle: The stairway was about like, fifty feet up so imagine you know the acropolis kind of thing.Goodrich: So, do we make a run check?Kyle: I would say, Raz’ul, just for posterity you were able to hold on to your needle-Goodrich: Hurray-Kyle: But you lose it-Goodrich: Aw-Kyle: When you pierced it, you got like blown back a little bit but you still have the needle in your hand. So, you can still have that in your inventory but-Spurrier: Nice!Kyle: Yeah, I'm gonna say we’re out of combat and uh-Goodrich: Little bit!Kyle: Symbol’s just saying-Kyle(as Symbol): We gotta go, let’s- let’s get out of here.Kyle: And he grabs Mitch and he’s like-Kyle(as Symbol): Mitch come on, I still need you buddy let’s roll.Goodrich: Do we need to roll too, Kyle? For-[All laughing]Kyle: No, you don’t need to roll. Uh, you know what now that you say it- yeah! Roll me-Goodrich: [Laughing] Oh my gosh!Kyle: You made your bed- I'm joking, I'm not gonna do that to you.[All laugh]Ali: I think maybe just Goodrich roll something!Kyle: The- the temple around you is collapsing and you see the open doorway that you came through and you can see- you can see down it.Ali: Alright, since we’re all running and I’m still raging I'm gonna dash ahead since that’s a bonus thing for my primal path.Kyle: Mkay.Ali: Just to make sure it’s clear for everybody. So, I’m gonna take off.Goodrich: Randy and I are running and like, clutching our chests like [panicked breathing] as you speed right past us!Ali(as Yashee): I’m gonna make sure it’s clear for us, guys!Kyle: You see Yashee- her stride just like, she takes these long strides and just gets way ahead of you guys.Goodrich: Can it be like Free Willy where we’re liking running and all the sudden-[All talking over each other at once excitedly]Goodrich: Like right over our heads like, “whoa!”Kyle: She like hurdles over you and Micheal Jackson is just sitting there like, [imitating Micheal Jackson] hee hee![All laughing]Kyle: Um, okay so Yashee you’ve dashed down the hallway leading to the front door of this temple. You come out to the front door and you can see the stairs outside that lead down to the ground and again this is about fifty-feet up in the air. You can see that jackal-weres that were there running away from you. They're like falling and trying to get down the stairs as best as they can, but they’re like falling and tripping over themselves and rolling down the stairs. You look back down the hallway that you just ran out of from the main room of this temple and you can see Symbol, Mitch, Randy and Raz’ul running as they’re trying to escape the collapse of this temple. You’re standing in the open doorway compelling them to hurry up.Ali: Okay, so I'm gonna yell after them-Ali(as Yashee): Just run as fast as you can, I’ve got it!Goodrich(as Raz’ul): [Breathless] We are- we are running!Ali: So, I’m going to un-rage and start beating out a little tune on the stone in preparation for them to come flying out of the tower.Kyle: What spell are you casting?Ali: I’ll be casting feather fall.Kyle: Okay, let's hear you tap that out.Ali: Okay- [singing and playing drums to the tune of Wonder Wall] I said maybe, you’re gonna land a little more lightly. Cause after all, casting feather fall. [Music ends, someone laughs] Alright!Kyle: Sweet!Kyle: Randy, Raz’ul and the other two- you're running towards the entrance and you see Yashee like, “come on guys, come on!” and she starts tapping out her spell and playing something and you can hear the music filling the air. She turns to run with you as you pass the threshold of this temple and the collapse just emits a wave of force and sends you flying forward. Everybody give me a dexterity save.[Sounds of dice hitting surface]Ali: I have advantage on dexterity saving throws.Spurrier: I got a natural twent. [Angelic chorus of “Oh yeaah!” plays, all laugh]Kyle: Oh yeah!Goodrich: [Away from the mic, laughing] Every time!Spurrier: Plus three, so that’s twenty-three.Kyle: Cool-Ali: I got twelve plus one as my best roll.Kyle: Twelve plus one? Okay.Goodrich: I got a seven plus nothing.Kyle: And I need to roll for the other two. [Rolls dice] Cool, they’re good. Raz’ul you’re knocked head over heels as you’re sent flying forward over these stairs. Yashee and Randy you’re able to like, dive off gracefully and so are Mitch and Symbol. Raz’ul you’re going head over heels but you look like you’re about to fall like, face first on to the stairs but then you kind of just like float to the very bottom.Spurrier: Since I got a natural twent- since he’s going down like that can I land on him like a surf board-[All laughing]Spurrier: And just kind of ride him down?Kyle: You absolutely do that!Spurrier: Thanks, Kyle!Kyle: You jump on top and just like stand on Raz’ul as he’s floating down, and you’re just like, “yeah this is great!” Yashee, you do a deft maneuver to be able to get off the stairs with Mitch and Symbol- anything in particular?Ali: I guess I’ll do a bunch of sweet flips through the air and really show off my acrobatics skills?Kyle: Alright, roll an acrobats at advantage since you have feather fall going on-Ali: Cool!Kyle: We’ll see how sick these moves are.Ali: [Excited] Alright!Goodrich: There it is!Ali: It’s a natural twenty! [Angelic chorus of “Oh yeaah!”]Kyle: Awesome!Ali: Plus four acrobatics.Kyle: So, you dive off and you do some sick flips and you’re actually able to make contact with Raz’ul a little bit and bounce off him for another sweet flip. But before that you give Randy a sick high-five as he’s surfing down on top of Raz’ul.[Players laughing]Kyle: So, you all find your way to the bottom of the stairs and you turn and-Goodrich: That’s a good verb, we “find” our way down! Can I try to give you guys a high five like, “Yeah me too! Me too!”Ali: No.Goodrich: Nah, I was gonna give you thirty, but your face is too dirty! [Players groan]Kyle: Okay so, you’re at the bottom of the stairs and you all stand up and get yourselves situated; and you’re looking back at this collapsed temple as it’s finally like, resting. And as it comes to a rest you notice that the base of it cracks-Goodrich: [Worried] Oh..Kyle: And it starts to slide and it slides to the left and hits this tall tower. The tower starts leaning, creaking and groaning as it falls in your direction. And Symbol’s looking up at it and is like-Kyle(as Symbol): [Terrified] We’re not done![All players laughing throughout, theme song plays]Kyle(as Symbol): We need to run! Run guys, run!-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter1/30/2019"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-11-,Ep. 11 – Out of the Frying Pan,"Ep. 11 – Out of the Frying Pan[Theme song plays]Kyle: [Deeper voice] Last time on BomBARDed [High pitched] Oh my god, show me what you saw in the stone! Tell me what I wanna know right now or I’m gonna attack you!Goodrich: But why!Kyle: [Deeper voice, mockingly] We don’t want to, oh my god. [Normal voice] And then you guys got into a fight.Goodrich: Pretty much.[All laugh]Kyle: But during this fight Randy had a clever idea to sneak his portable hole into battle. Which resulted in Jairah amazingly not noticing it and falling in. At that point Raz’ul had the quick thought to go over and fold that portable hole close and pin it with his unbending needling.Goodrich: I just really wanted to put a pin in this battle.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely I understand. But, instead of doing what he wanted this actually caused an intense explosion and then there was nothing, but that’s because they were in a void out of nowhere so; a bodiless entity came to them and was able to coax the magic out of our bards by presenting three pillars of dark matter and asking, can you breathe life? Our bards performed but their magic was not able to meet their request to which the entity responded, “so you can’t, but fortunately I can. I'm excited to create with this power.” This is when the pillars went amorphous blob style and start restructuring themselves into three figures, which mirrored each one of our bards. That whole event ended with these figures' eyes opening. Which, you guys came back and pretty much picked up right at the explosion part which turned into an implosive event and began sucking in the stones and pillars and things nearby. So, the commotion that happened from that event actually caused the temple to start collapsing, which you were able to escape from in style- well two out of three of you escaped in style-Goodrich: I did it in my own style, Kyle![Laughter]Kyle: Yeah, I guess that’s style. So- but thanks to a feather fall spell by Yashee we were able to get a sweet moment of Randy being able to surf down on a flailing Raz’ul and landing safely at the bottom of the stairs. But, this wasn’t the end of your troubles- which speaking of that, there’s a tower falling in your direction. So-Goodrich: We’re not out of the woods yet!Ali: Can I do a check to see if I see like, a little window opening where maybe we can run up and huddle a la like, Aladdin? When he gets transported by Jafar and the tower rolls over them?Kyle: Yeah I got ya- that is a really cool moment, dang! Um, give me a perception check real quick.Ali: [Laughing] Okay. [Rolls dice] It is a thirteen plus one?Kyle: Thirteen plus one? You look up and you see what looks like a really old window that’s pretty tiny? And as this is falling you notice that the structure of the top is starting to collapse in on itself as it’s falling, so that doesn’t look like it’s gonna be a viable route.Ali: Alright, well-Kyle: On top of that, debris is starting to be flung in your direction as like, where the base of the temple hit that tower-Goodrich: Right.Kyle: It sent debris flying and you can see dust like, billowing in your direction.Ali: Alright-Goodrich: Also, Aladdin is a cartoon and this is real life, Ali!Ali: Hey, hey![All laugh]Ali: [Sarcastic] Yeah, this is real life.Goodrich: Yeah, so uh-Ali: Alright, I might be stupid but I’m not that dumb I’m gonna-Kyle: Yeah![All laugh loudly]Ali: I’m just gonna- gonna get out of there.Kyle: So, Symbol says-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, I think I can get us through this. Just try to follow me the best you can!Kyle: And he grabs Mitch and is like-Kyle (as Symbol): Come on, Mitch.Kyle: And he starts taking off.Spurrier: Onwards!Ali: How fast can they run?Kyle: Uh, this is gonna be a chase scene so the mechanic is gonna work a little bit differently-Goodrich: Oh, cool!Kyle: I am going to throw in moments as you’re running from whatever’s happening, and we’ll see what those are. I have a table I've made up which has a number of different random things that could happen in the process of fleeing.Ali: Cool.Kyle: So, there are seven opportunities for you to fail. If you get five out of seven fails, you’re gonna fall behind and lose the group.Goodrich: Oh dang.Kyle: So- yeah, essentially every time you fail you lose like ten feet-Spurrier: Mm!Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: And like after five, you’re gonna be fifty feet away from the rest of the group. Or uh, you know if you all fail all at the same time you could wind up being separated from just Symbol and Mitch.Ali: Right.Kyle: Or you could be separated on your own.Spurrier: Right, right, right-Kyle: Um, which [laughing] I don’t know what’s gonna happen if that happens but we’ll have to figure it out.[Players laughing]Goodrich: Not so good! Oh boy!Kyle: So uh, so yeah, just hope that you pass more than uh- hopefully you just pass![Players laugh]Goodrich: So, there are many animals in the animal kingdom that can probably run faster than a dwarf.Kyle: I can imagine.Goodrich: [Laughs] Yeah, so Raz’ul’s gonna try transforming into one of those and-Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: I’m not gonna say anything to you guys, cause I cut it pretty close last time-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Uhh..sixty-eight-Spurrier: So close.Goodrich: A giant toad.[All laugh]Kyle: Alright!Ali: It’s giant!Spurrier: Giant-Ali: Hopping ability-Kyle: Yeah, I mean you know, what does it say?Goodrich: A large beast.Kyle: Large beast, so it’s a large size which means it’s bigger than-Ali: Bigger than me-Spurrier: Yeah, it’s bigger than Yashee-Kyle: Bigger than Yashee-Goodrich: Yeah, I just say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Groans and voice becomes deeper] And I’m a giant toad.Spurrier: And Randy looks over and says-Spurrier (as Randy): Hey there mister toad, can I hop along?[All laugh]Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice] Hop along, little Randy.[Players laugh]Kyle: Okay, Randy’s gonna hop on top of Raz’ul and ride it on out. I think Symbol and Mitch are gonna stick with their feets-Ali: I’m gonna stick with my feets-Kyle: You’re gonna stick with your feets? Okay, cool. Symbol has already started booking a trail and you’re trying to keep up with him. He turns down this one alley way and uh, it winds up dumping out into a main road. You find yourselves in the midst of a stampede of jackal-weres.Ali: [Chuckles] Oh my gosh..Spurrier: Oh boy..Goodrich: They’re like bi-peds though, right?Kyle: Yeah, exac- well some of them are bi-peds, some of them are full on jackals like, you know you see jackals as well running-Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: It’s a mixture of humans, jackal-weres and jackals.Goodrich: [Surprised] Wow! Okay!Kyle: So- and they’re all fleeing as buildings behind them are collapsing and large chunks of stone are like, flying into buildings and knocking them over and creating a lot of catastrophe. For this I'm gonna go ahead and have Raz’ul and Yashee give me a dexterity check, and the number to beat is twelve. I'm just gonna tell you these.[Multiple dice rolling]Goodrich: ..Seven.Ali: Mine is an eight plus one!Kyle: Okay and Randy, because of Raz’ul’s roll go ahead and give me a strength check.Spurrier: ‘Kay. [Rolls dice] Ahh strength, okay that is a seventeen plus nothing.Kyle: Okay, you’re actually good to go-Spurrier: Phew!Kyle: You come out of this alley way to find this stampeding group of jackal-weres, humans and jackals. Yashee and Raz’ul you’re completely blindsided by this, Yashee you’re knocked over and you’re trampled a little bit by this group and you take six damage-Ali: Oh no!Kyle: As these feet kind of stomp into you. Raz’ul, you and your big toad body are knocked over-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice, pained grunting]Kyle: Randy, you’re holding on for dear life-Spurrier (as Randy): [Yells]Kyle: And luckily all the jackals seem to be stampeding over Raz’ul and you don’t get stampeded on at all.Spurrier: Mufasa![All laugh]Kyle: Raz’ul you’re gonna take four damage as these jackals climb up over your body. The stampede recedes a little bit and you’re able to get back on your feet and continue running. Buildings are collapsing near you and around you, Symbol’s kind of looking back at you guys, he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): You’re gonna have to keep up if you wanna keep doing this, like come on guys we gotta get out of here!Kyle: So that’s a fail for Yashee, and a fail for Raz’ul, which Randy you’re on top so unfortunately that puts you in the same area. Okay, you’re able to get back on your feet and continue running through the city and as you’re running- [rolls dice] let's look here and see what we got. So, you’re running and a building nearby collapses and it causes a sink hole in the area that you’re walking on. I need Yashee and Raz’ul to give me a dexterity save. [Multiple dice rolling, laughter] Let’s see if you can manage those sinking sands.Goodrich: I’ll try!Kyle: There we go!Goodrich: There it is! Okay I got a sixteen plus one, seventeen.Kyle: Okay, you’re good to go.Ali: Okay, and I have an advantage of dex saving throws-Kyle: Okay-Ali: So, my first one was a five and my second one was an eight plus four so twelve.Kyle: Awesome. Raz’ul you’re uh, you’re hopping along and everything and the sand starts to shift from underneath you but you’re like “nope!” and you’re able-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice] Nope, nope, nope!Kyle:  -to make your way out of it, Randy still on your back. Yashee you uh, the sand kind of sweeps out from under your feet, you’re caught off guard a little bit, but you plant your hand down and you’re able to like pick yourself back up and just keep moving at the same speed. So you got past that one fairly well.Ali: Sweet.Kyle: You continue through the city following Symbol. He makes a left, then a right and you’re able to avoid any kind of impedance for the time being. Let’s see what happens next! [Rolls dice] so he’s taking you down one of these main roads and after a little bit you feel like you’re pretty clear but then, out of this alleyway in front of you a cart gets rushed out from a person pushing it as they’re running away from something. Everybody give me a dexterity check.Goodrich: I have plenty of experience playing frogger.Kyle: Yeah, there you go.Goodrich: Let’s see here..Kyle: DC is a twelve.Ali: Twelve plus one, thirteen.Kyle: Good!Goodrich: I got a five plus one soo..Kyle: Okay, uh so Yashee you’re leading the way and you just like one arm slide over this guy’s cart and just continue on. Raz’ul you plow right into it and you’re caught off-guard-[Players laugh]Kyle: Randy, go ahead and give me a strength check.Spurrier: [Nervous] Okay, oh boy.. [rolls dice] uh, that’s a seven.Kyle: Okay so, Raz’ul’s big toad body like, can’t seem to make the jump like, sand slips out from under its toady feet, just goes right head first into this cart and you get flung off the front of Raz’ul as you get flown and you’re like- actually roll me an acrobatics check, see how well you fair falling off the top of Raz’ul.Spurrier: [Sighs] Oh boy.. [rolls dice] that is a twelve plus nine, twenty-one.Kyle: Yeah, you definitely maneuver your way-Spurrier: Phew!Kyle: -as you’re flown from the top you get over the thing and you’re like, “ah!” falling forward and-Ali: Can I um, maybe try to catch him like a football?[Someone laughs]Kyle: Give me a dexterity check-Ali: I am already good at football so-Kyle: Yeah- actually no, give me an athletics check.Ali: Oh sweet, well that’s even better. [Pauses] That’s going to be a thirteen plus six-Kyle: Yeah, you do like a front flip and you sprawl your whole body out like, you know like a pancake and you can see like, Yashee-Spurrier: Like an actual acrobat-Kyle: She’s looking over her shoulder at you and she’s got her arms out and you’re just like, “home.”Spurrier: I’m here![Players laughing]Spurrier: It's me, Randy!Kyle: And Randy falls right into your grasp-Ali: Aw!Kyle: As you keep running along with him, you tuck him down to your side like a football with your hand like over his face.Ali (as Yashee): We’re gonna make it little buddy!Spurrier (as Randy): Thanks!Ali (as Yashee): You just hang on!Goodrich: Meanwhile I’m back there like [screams in a deeper voice].[Players laugh]Kyle: Okay, alright so Raz’ul you’re dragging a little bit behind. You have to shake your face off and look back like, “oh no!” and you can see like buildings just collapsing-Goodrich: [Scared] Woof..Kyle: Inwards on themselves.Ali: How are Symbol and um..Kyle: Mitch doing?Ali: Mitch doing?Kyle: They’re doing good.Ali: [Chuckles] Oh.Goodrich: I imagine this is kind of like the end of Star Fox when you’re following-Kyle: Yeah, they will end up being in front of all the stuff that winds up in your way so uh-Ali: Naturally of course!Goodrich: Good for them [laughs].Kyle: Uh, so next thing that happens. [Pauses] Well, nothings gonna happen for that one. You continue running on and you hear the sounds of buildings you know, like in the distance falling down. You can hear the shouts of crowds as people are fleeing, you know, people are trying to get their affects together as they’re running out of these dilapidated ruins. [Rolls dice] You hear the sound of chaos going on as things are collapsing around you-Goodrich: It’s a little saucy.Ali: Exactly how we like it.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: There’s a good stretch where you don’t have anything impede your movement. In this time, I'm gonna say nothing really happens. You see people running along with you, going different ways, you cut through a couple different ways because buildings have collapsed blocking the path that you’re going.Goodrich: Can I catch up to them since I have a twenty-foot leap?Kyle: Yes, I’ll say you can make a catch up in these uh, since like- I rolled like three different things and like nothing happens on any of them.Goodrich: Cause you know, Raz’ul gets knocked down..he gets back up again-[All chuckle]Ali: Yeah!Kyle: And you’re never gonna-Goodrich: [Sings in a silly voice] And you’re never gonna keep me down!Kyle: [Chuckles] Alright so you’re able to catch up, I'll knock off one of the fails here. Um, and-Goodrich: Thanks, Kyle!Kyle: Yeah, you’re welcome, I'm benevolent. Just remember it okay?[Players chuckle]Goodrich: ‘Kay.Kyle: Um, on this next one you keep running through this collapsing city [pauses] ooh, you hear the loud crash of buildings colliding and all the sudden you hear a whistling coming from above you. You look back and you see a boulder flying overhead. It winds up flying past you and it ends up in the ground in front of you and creates a hole in the ground.Goodrich: I gotta jump over a hole!?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Heck yeah! [Hums the Indian Jones theme]Kyle: Everybody give me a dexterity check, DC ten to beat.Goodrich: [Continues humming the theme, is joined by Spurrier] Finally!Spurrier: Since I’m being held-Kyle: You don’t have to make anything-Spurrier: Cool!Kyle: Sorry, Randy you don’t have to make this one.Spurrier: Just wanted to be sure.Ali: I got a seventeen plus one!Kyle: Sweet!Goodrich: Sixteen plus one!Kyle: Yashee, you hurdle jump this one just like when you were striding over the halfling and dwarf earlier and Raz’ul, being a toad, hoppings your game man-Goodrich: Naturally-Kyle: You got this on lockdown.Goodrich: All day.Kyle: So, you’re following Symbol and he through an alleyway then cuts back into a main road and as you’re running you notice somebody from a second story window and it looks like they’re just dumping out a bucket of refuse? Into the street?Spurrier: [Laughs] Why!?Kyle: Um, so go head-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice] Don’t worry about that shit![All laugh]Kyle: So yeah, they dump out refuse in front of you so go ahead and give me a dexterity check, got a ten to beat.Ali: I got a fourteen plus one!Goodrich: [Sighs] I got a three plus one.Kyle: Okay uh, [laughs] Yashee you’re able to make your way- you like make your way around this just in time so you don’t wind up slipping in it but unfortunately the toad slips-Goodrich: Ugh..Kyle: Slippy?Ali: Slips-[All laugh]Ali: Slippy, nooooooo!All: Nooooooooo![All laugh]Kyle: You’re hopping along and you hop right into this mess and you skitter and slid and kind of roll and you get a bunch of like, gook on you-Goodrich: [Disgusted] Ugh..Kyle: And everything-Goodrich: This is the second time as an animal-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: I’ve had poop on me.Kyle: It’s okay.Ali: First time was your own doing.[All agreeing and laughing]Kyle: It was your own doing. [Mumbling] So that’s gonna be another failer. [Normal voice] So you get back up and you’re like uh, skittering to get back to your feet under you and start hopping along to get your way out of here. So the next event that comes up, [rolls dice] you’re making your way down a road and then a building winds up collapsing from your left as another large tower falls into it. The debris that falls makes the way in front of you inaccessible, but there is an old staircase nearby still standing that can be used to jump to the other side. I need everybody to give me a dexterity check, you gotta beat a twelve. Well not everybody sorry, Randy you’re being carried-Spurrier: No, I'm just assuming, yeah-Goodrich: I got an eleven plus one, so I meet so I beat right!?Kyle: Yup-Ali & Spurrier: [Cheer]Kyle: You meet so you beat-Ali: I got a ninteen plus one.Kyle: Okay you both manage your way yup the staircase. Yashee, you’re leading the way so like you jump down on the other side of his pile of debris and you’re able to like slide down the little bit of rubble and sand that’s collided together.Ali: Nice.Goodrich: [Singing] Yashee, leading the way!Kyle: Raz’ul, you are meeting this as a giant toad, getting up a stairway made for medium sized people. You get to the top and jump off just as the stairs collapse from underneath you.Goodrich: Heck Yeah.Kyle: But you clear to the other side and you land on your feet and keep hopping along-Goodrich: Keep hopping along, yeah.Kyle: Let’s see, one more. [Rolls dice] Alright, you wind up taking another turn following Symbol and it goes into this back alleyway, you see Symbol and Mitch they’re humping- they're- humping..[All laugh loudly throughout]Goodrich: Like, what are you guys doing!?Kyle: There’s no time for this! There’s no time for this![Beep]Kyle: So, you turn down this alleyway and you see Symbol and Mitch HOPPING over these barrels that are blocking the way and you’re trying to make your way down there. So, everybody give me another dexterity check to see if you can make it through this maze of barrels.Goodrich: Are you talking about a dexterity check to HOP Kyle?Kyle: Yeah, dude.Ali: I got an eleven plus one.Goodrich: [Laughs] I got a four plus one.Kyle: Oh man, Yashee-Goodrich: I don’t know how to use this this toad body, it’s so hard!Kyle: [Chuckles] It’s so new and I wasn’t expecting it to be what it is.Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle: Yashee, you meet so you’re able to just barely make your way over, and it’s harder with only one arm considering you’re still carrying Randy. Unfortunately, you can hear the clatter of barrels getting knocked over behind you. You look back for a second and you see this toad just like, clumsily trying to get its way over these barrels but it keeps like- like he’ll put his foot on top of one and it’ll slip out from under him and he’ll fall and everything so unfortunately Raz’ul you’re losing another one there.Goodrich: I’m like that big ATST on Endor.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Like, “Oh jeez!”Kyle: Yeah, that’s exactly what it looks like! You're just like, “ah jeez!” um, so Raz’ul you are twenty feet behind Randy and Yashee and Randy you are trailing twenty feet behind Symbol.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice] Guys, wait for me!Kyle: [Chuckles] So you uh, you make your way out of this alley and you find yourself in one of the main roads. It's actually a little bit more recognizable, it looks like the main road you took into the temple. As you exit the alleyway you look to your right. You see another stampede of people and there is a large circular tower that is rolling behind them. This thing keeps rolling so everybody give me a dexterity check real quick!Goodrich: Here comes your Aladdin moment.Ali: Is this- is this it?Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Well I got a one plus one.Kyle: On dexterity?Ali: [Chuckles] Yeah.Kyle: Oh god, okay.Goodrich: Uh, eight plus one. Do I need to do strength or-Kyle: Yeah, you’ll need to do a strength on this one Randy. Go ahead and give me that to see if you can hold onto Yashee’s arm.Spurrier: Uh, that’s an eight plus nothing.Kyle: No, you-[Players laugh]Kyle: Yashee is just trampled over and you’re sent flying out of her hands and you’re gonna get trample as well.Spurrier (as Randy) Ahh!Kyle: And Raz’ul you’re knocked over as well, there’s this one jackal-were and he’s pushing a large cart and he just runs right into you and knocks you over on your side and he rolls it up and over you somehow.Goodrich: Ow.Kyle: He’s really desperate to get out of there. Uh, lemme roll [rolls dice] you all take, eight damage.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice, grunts in pain]Kyle: And Raz’ul, glad I gave you that one.Goodrich: Yeah for real! Thank you, Kyle!Kyle: Okay, so the crowd is kind of past you and you’re getting up and this large tower’s still rolling towards you. What’re you gonna do?Ali: Um, I want to look at the tower rolling towards us and again see if there’s a place where we could duck in Aladdin style.Kyle: There is no place-Ali: No place-Kyle: -where you could duck in, this is a solid tower. Never hurts to ask, maybe we’ll get it eventually.Ali: Is the tower taking up the full width of the road?Kyle: It looks about like it-Ali: Like are there buildings on the side-Kyle: Yeah-Ali: Or could we get around it?Kyle: There’s buildings on the sides but it’s hitting the buildings on the side and it’s tearing away at them as it’s rolling along.Goodrich: If only we had that portable hole! [Laughs]Spurrier: I was about to- [sighs] Yeah..Kyle: That would have worked, that would have definitely worked here.Ali: Where is Symbol right now?Kyle: Symbol has taken a left and he has like worked his way to the back of the pack of jackal-weres and he’s like yelling at you guys like-Kyle (as Symbol): [Yelling] Hey seriously, you need to keep up! If you can’t keep up, you’re probably gonna die!Goodrich: [Chuckles] Oh really? That's the kind of quality education we’re getting from Splash right there.Ali: I kind of want to try like- How big is the tower? How tall up is it?Kyle: The tower? Uh, from where you’re standing, on its side is probably about like twenty feet tall.Ali: Hmm..Kyle: You wanna see if you can hop on it and roll it-Ali: I wanna try to like log roll it, yeah.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Can we hang on to Raz’ul and have him hop us up there and try to..bedledledl twinkle toes it?Kyle: If that’s what you want to do, by all means!Goodrich: [Nervous] Okay! Do you want to do it?Ali: [Nervous] It’s- it’s up to you!Goodrich: Yup!Spurrier: I mean, we don’t have a lot of other options.Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: Uh, I've been rolling super great but let’s try it! Can I uh, wall jump? Would you count that as twenty feet if I jump off the side of a building- you know, like a wall jump.Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: Like in Mario-Kyle: Let’s do it.Ali: So, I’m gonna yell to Raz’ul-Ali (as Yashee): You think you can hop up there, bud?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice, nervous] Uh, Yeah? I think so? Maybe if I go off the side of a building, I can get up there.Ali (as Yashee): Alright, well it’s worth a shot!Ali: So, I grab Randy and grab onto Raz’ul.Kyle: Okay, so you grab Randy and grab onto Raz’ul. Go ahead and give me a strength check, Yashee.Ali: [Rolls dice] Um, that is nine plus three.Kyle: Okay, that’ll be good.Goodrich: So now do I need to do the-Kyle: Yeah, go ahead and give me uh, I guess it’d be like athletics for the toad?Goodrich: Alright.Kyle: Parkouring is athletics and acrobatics.Spurrier: And you’re holding two different people so more about being ripped-Goodrich: Being ripped, yeah.Ali: Can I send a bardic inspiration die his way?Goodrich: [Cheers]Kyle: [Excited] Yeah, absolutely!Spurrier: I don’t know if we were caught up in the action that we could do that so-Kyle: That’s fine, whip out a little beat though.Ali: So- okay, can I get Randy’s help on inspiring Raz’ul to do this?Kyle: Yes, you can go ahead and do that and, I'm not gonna do this every time but I'll say for this time since you’re performing it together, we’ll bump it up to a d8.Goodrich: Hurray!Spurrier: Should we both expend an inspiration dice though?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Ali: Alright, so before I hop up on Raz’ul I'm gonna turn to Randy and say-Ali (as Yashee): Hey, you know I think he may need a little bit of our help this time to make this jump happen. You wanna help me out?Spurrier (as Randy): I think you’re right.Ali (as Yashee): We need to uh, we need to inspire him.Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s do it.[Soft piano melody begins and drums follow soon after]Ali: [Singing] I believe you can fly, I believe you can jump that high. I know you’re gonna save our lives today, eating flies along the way. Oh, I believe you can fly![Music ends, Goodrich chuckles]Kyle: Alright, so Raz’ul go ahead and give me that uh, give me that check-Goodrich: [Nervously] Okay..Kyle: Don’t forget to add your dice-Ali: Oh boy!Goodrich: And what am I needing to beat?Kyle: You need to beat a sixteen.Goodrich: Sixteen!?Spurrier: That’s why you got a d8-Goodrich: That’s so many! Ugh!Kyle: Harder of a maneuver than the other things.Goodrich: That’s true.Spurrier: You are carrying all of us.Kyle: That’s true.[Dice rolls, all players cheer loudly]Goodrich: Nat Twent! [Sings excitedly while the whole band plays] This is my twent song, my natural twent song it’s what I play when I roll them twents! You'll never know Kyle, just went I roll them so I will play my twent song for you![Music ends, angelic chorus sings “Oh yeaah!”]Kyle: What a perfect time for this to happen! You bounce off the side of the building and you jump up to the top of this rolling tower and you get up top. Everybody is up there and you’re spinning your legs as fast as you can to keep up with this thing rolling.Ali: Ninja Warrior!Goodrich: Ninja Warrior style!Kyle: I have a quick question Randy and Yashee, are you just gonna stay on top of him as he rolls?Goodrich: You see me rollin’[All burst into laughter]Spurrier: I’m not gonna be hatin’Goodrich: [Laughing] You’re gonna be ridin’ dirty-Spurrier: Gonna be ridin’ dirty, it’s fine.Goodrich: You’re gonna be ridin’ really dirty after what got dumped on me.Ali: I mean, I'm fine to just hang on for dear life and hope for the best?Spurrier: Yeah, same here.Kyle: Alright, so the tower is rolling down this main road and you can see like the edge of town from the vantage point that you’re at; and you notice that this road that you’re on kind of narrows and like, you’re rolling to the edge and you notice that this tower might not clear the last two buildings? That are at the end of the town. And the tower just hits these two buildings that are at the end of this road way leading to a downward hill and the tower just kind of collapses underneath you as it hits these two buildings and the stones get pushed forward. You all, still riding on top of Raz’ul, you wind up finding yourself on top of a large, flat slab and Raz’ul you’re still able to manage- you're like kind of freaking out a little bit but it’s big enough for you to still stand on, and this slab hits the downhill angle and starts to slide and you’re like- “whoa, whoa!” and I need you to give me a dexterity check. Just you Raz’ul.Goodrich: [Sighs]Kyle: You’re the only one.Goodrich: I already used my- [chuckles] I already used my inspiration dice.Ali: It was a really roll important roll.Goodrich: The other one was a really important roll!Ali: No I’m saying that one was- that one was! I’m saying that one was really important. You need to-[Dice rolls, everyone cheers loudly again]Kyle: I can’t believe it![Angelic chorus of “Oh yeaah!” plays]Goodrich: Natural twent!Kyle: So, you land on this slab and it sinks into the ground and starts skirting across the top of the downhill angle. Sand is skittering up past you as you’re sliding down full speed on this big slab of stone, basically sand surfing down this hill.Goodrich: Right, yeah.Kyle: And you actually like blow past Symbol and Mitch as they’re sliding on their backs, and they look at you like-All: Whoa!Kyle: And you wind up like skittering to the bottom and it slides to the side and just comes to a stop.Goodrich: Totally ate it in the temple jump, made up for it in a big way!Kyle: Yup! So, you’ve made it to the edge of town and you’re exhausted, panting and sweating.Goodrich: And croaking.Kyle: Yeah absolutely, and you turn to look at this city that you just escaped and you can see the last few towers that are at the top of the hill, that are in your vision, you can see them starting to collapse. Just like, the dust cloud that is emitting from this ruin is just massive and almost like- not blacks out the sky but it definitely makes it like a big shadow over you. Jackals are still running and fleeing for their life and they’re just running out into random directions out into the desert. As they’re fleeing in all directions trying to escape the catastrophe, I need everybody to give me a perception check.Ali: Of course.Kyle: And that is everybody, nobody’s left out of this one.Spurrier: Oh, okay![Dice rolls]Goodrich: That is a two plus three, five.Kyle: Can’t get them every time.Spurrier: That’s a seventeen plus three, twenty.Kyle: Cool.Ali: Mine is an eight plus one, nine.Kyle: Alright, okay Randy you’re standing with the rest of the group, you’re watching this and you hear a horse whinnying and you hear the galloping of a horse, and you hear the creaking of carriage wheels going. You turn to look and you see Symbol’s carriage is running unmanned towards you and it’s just at full sprint. It's running in your direction.Spurrier: Oh!Goodrich: Can this all be happening like Yashee and I high-five like, that was awesome! That was so sick, dude!Kyle: Yes!Ali (as Yashee): I thought we’d be dead for sure!Kyle: While Yashee and Raz’ul high five each other for what just happened- does that mean you transformed out?Goodrich: Uh..yes-Ali: [Laughs] I’m just slapping his toad hands like, ugh!Goodrich: Like, oh gross you’re covered in poo![All laugh]Ali: Well we all are at this point.Goodrich: [Laughs] Yeah! I’ll say as I got to the bottom of the hill I jumped off while you guys you know, kind of slid off my back and I transformed in mid-air, landed on my feet, and I'm gonna roll for it- [rolls dice] aw man you know that’s an eight, so I did pretty good![All laugh]Kyle: You rolled- I guess you rolled for a dexterity?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: What’s better, acrobatics or athletics?Goodrich Uh, athletics so eight plus three, eleven.Kyle: Yeah, you jump off and you- you jump off after you morph? Or morph in mid-air?Goodrich: Yeah, morph in mid-air of course.Kyle: Okay yeah of course, why wouldn’t you do that? So yeah, you’re jumping off and you morph in mid-air and you wind up being in a jump man pose-Goodrich: Yeah [laughs].Kyle: But then your feet come down hard and you slide a little bit and you’re able to maintain your footing underneath you.Ali: Phew!Kyle: And you turn around and look at Yashee-Goodrich: Heart beating- let's do it again!Kyle: Yashee and Raz’ul, they’re having their celebratory moment and Symbol and Mitch are kind of just like you know, doubling over and are just like, [panting heavily] and uh Randy, you notice that carriage bolting right towards you guys. It does not look like it’s slowing down.Spurrier: Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Hey guys take a look; our carriage is on the move.Kyle: And Symbol’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Uh, somebody at least stop it or try to!Goodrich: I whisper to Randy-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know why Symbol doesn’t want to give it a shot.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Um, well I have speak with animals so I could try to calm the horses down a bit.Kyle: Mkay.Goodrich: I look at the horses- I guess I call out to them cause they’re like- and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Yelling/singing, while playing guitar quickly] Talk to me like horses do, please slow down! Walk with me, don’t run, like horses do![Music stops]Kyle: Alright, so you’re saying this- give me a persuade roll and-Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Seventeen! Plus, three.Kyle: Plus, three? Okay yeah, you get an un-natural twenty and uh, the horse kind of like comes to a [something] and it stops and it says-Kyle (as Horse): [With a deeper voice and western drawl] Oh alright, if you say so-[Players laugh]Kyle (as Horse): If you say it’s alright.Goodrich: Alright Mister Ed.Kyle (as Horse): I’ll give it a halt real quick.Kyle: And he comes to a halt and slides in the sand and comes to a stop you know, just shy of your location.Goodrich: So, can I shrug and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): whoa hey [shushes] what’s going on?Kyle (as Horse): Just all that noise going on over there got me spooked. So uh, you know just uh trying to get away from all the havoc, most people try to take me and the cart. I know Symbol wants to keep his cart.Spurrier: And so, while this is happening are they speaking to each other in neighs?[All laugh]Kyle: Yeah! Like, [neighs and whinnies] Raz’ul is doing like a combination of like neighs and [blows raspberry] and stuff like that. So, it sounds like he’s talking like a horse and the horse is talking back to him.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Kyle: And you’re just watching this conversation go on.Kyle (as Horse): Okay, whenever ya’ll are ready I guess uh, good ol’-I think his name is Mitch, it’s hard to tell sometimes the way you people talk.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I know, they’re a bunch of whack-a-doos.Kyle (as Horse): Hey man I really like you, you’re pretty cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You know what? You’re alright too man.Kyle (as Horse): Thanks!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s your name?Kyle: (as Horse): Uh, my names Flotsam.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Like Flotsam and Jetsam?Kyle (as Horse): Man, how’d you know my brother!?[All laugh]Goodrich: Okay!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, hey Flotsam. Nice to meet you and I’ll see you around sometimes-Kyle (as Horse): Hey man, you can chat with me any time. We'll have- just bring some oats.Goodrich: I have a water skin; can I give him some water?Kyle: Yeah, if you wanna give him some water.Goodrich: And uh-Kyle: You notice that there’s a feed bag where the driver would sit.Goodrich: Okay! So, I grab the feed bag and some water and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Here you go dude, just take a chill pill- just take it easy for a little bit, take it eeeaasy.Kyle: So, he gets- he gets his mouth and everything and all set up and he’s like-Kyle: (as Horse): [Mumbling like he has food in his mouth]Goodrich: I turn back around to you guys and I'm like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think we’re good, he just got a little spooked.Kyle: And Symbol’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I mean that makes sense. He is just a horse.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey! Hey! He’s not just a-Kyle (as Symbol): That’s probably what he eats.Goodrich: He- [Starts laughing] Shut up..Kyle (as Symbol): Okay fine Raz’ul I’m sorry. I understand maybe you’re more akin to animals, being from the woods and what not.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): His names Flotsam and he’s a great, great guy.Kyle: Mitch interjects and he says-Kyle (as Mitch): Well, his name is actually Duncan so uh, you know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I'm the guy that just talked to the horse and he said his names Flotsam. I would maybe start calling him Flotsam.Kyle (as Mitch): Oh..Okay, I'll consider it. Never really thought about it, I guess.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): If you want him to show you the meaning of haste, I would probably call him by his proper name.Kyle (as Mitch): He usually does a pretty good job with the haste but uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You thought you saw haste.Kyle (as Mitch): I appreciate you at least getting him set up with some water and some oats. Pardon me Symbol, I'm going to check on the carriage to see if it’s all up to snuff for us to continue onto Basom. And uh, I'll guess I'll be sure you let you know when I use the bathroom next time! [Laughs]Kyle: And he kind of just like nudges him and Symbol’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Ha, ha! [sternly] Yeah, you should.[Players laugh]Goodrich: The classic, ha ha ha! [sternly] seriously.Kyle: Like, don’t do that again. Mitch goes over and he starts getting the carriage- like double checking everything. Making sure the axels on the carriage are working alright.Goodrich: We didn’t break a wagon wheel? We didn’t have to ford the river?Kyle: You didn’t have to ford the river, you didn’t break a wagon wheel, there’s not a river anyway. So, Symbol like, turns to you guys and he’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): That was wild! That really crazy, that is a good tale! Granted, you could have been more inquisitive to the nature of these people, I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah I mean, we were dealing with a lot back then. Quite frankly-Kyle (as Symbol): Back then? It was like thirty minutes ago, dude..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It doesn’t- It feels like way longer-Ali (as Yashee): It does feel longer.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): I understand, I can understand that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, you’re good.Kyle (as Symbol): So um, I will say that this is a good tale. People should hear about this I mean, mainly to probably avoid these ruins, doubted that anything would be able to inhabit them again thanks to us, I guess. But uh, it behooves you to write a song about this tale and try to spread it around because something like this shouldn’t not be lost. Actually why don’t you go ahead and get cracking on that and I'm gonna help Mitch real quick. Bring me what you got.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, sounds good![Electronic music plays]Spurrier: [Sings] Chord dice tiime-Kyle: We’re gonna move on to our chord dice time, let’s do it!Spurrier: Fire in the hole![Multiple dice hitting the surface]Goodrich: Oh boy..Spurrier: So far so good.Goodrich: So far so good.Spurrier: Oh boy, alright.Goodrich: [Sighs] Okay well, it’s gonna be kind of a sad song. D minor, D minor, B diminished and F. It was kind of a crazy time-Spurrier: And C.Goodrich: And C, so- okay well-Spurrier: Drums!Kyle: Yup, let’s do the drums.Ali: Okay [pauses] coin toss is heads so it’s gonna be from the first bank, and the pattern is- [pauses] forty-four, which gives us rock twenty-four.Goodrich: Yup.Ali: And now the drum kit.Goodrich: Considering all the stones and rocks we just damaged-Spurrier: Yeah-Ali: Okay, eighty-five.Spurrier & Goodrich: [Singing] Eighty-five..Ali: Which is, techno eight.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Alrighty.Kyle: Alright, get to writing![Goodrich whines]Kyle: Listeners, I'll talk to you in a second.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle here just wanted to say thank you again for listening and for joining us like you do.

We already have some ideas but we’d love to hear from all of you about what you’d think you’d like to see on a BomBARDed patreon, and you know if you have something go ahead and send it on over. Other than that, I don’t really have any other updates so let’s get back to the episode and see what happens![Music transitions]Ali (as Yashee): Symbol, before you go how about this?Kyle: Symbol turns around and he just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Certainly, you could give it a little more time-Kyle: And before he finishes his sentence, you notice that sand begins to lift nearby taking the shape of a large orb. There are a few flashes of light inside then you see a figure just flash inside of it. The commotion stops and the sand falls to the ground revealing a tall man wearing brown robes and holding two packages. He looks around then looks at the packages and looks at you four and says-Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): I’ve got a package for Randy Greentrees and Uh..Yasha..rock Bor-din?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, that’s me![Someone laughs]Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): That’s you? Okay uh-Kyle: And he looks around and like, looks at the ruins and says-Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): Holy Altonia[?], what happened here?Goodrich: (as Raz’ul): Uh, don’t worry about it.Kyle: (as Delivery Wizard): [Hesitantly] Oh..kay, well if I can have the tracking stones that Emma gave you you can have your packages.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, you’re the delivery wizard.Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, great!Spurrier (as Randy): [Singing] Awesome!Kyle: Right so, you have the tracking stones yes?Ali (as Yashee): Yes, hmm..Kyle: Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Here you go!Kyle: He takes those from you and he says-Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): Alright, here’s your packages uh [coughs]-Kyle: And he coughs because of all the sand and dust in the air.Goodrich: [Laughs] Naturally.Kyle: And uh, he’s like-Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): I guess I'll be off to my next person to deliver to.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What was your name? Again?Kyle (as Delivery Wizard): Reginald.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Reginald.Kyle: (as Delivery Wizard): Yeah. Reginald Brown.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, oh! Any relation to Alto Brown?Kyle (as Reginald): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. Sorry, there’s a guy named Alto Brown he uh..a-Kyle (as Reginald): [Uninterested] Mm!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, nevermind.Kyle: Symbol stops for a moment and puts his hand on Reginald’s shoulder and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Actually, I have an idea here. How about, Reginald, would you like to hear the actual tale of what happened here? These are students of mine from the bard college and uh, I'd like to hear an outsider take of their work.Kyle: Reginald like-Kyle (as Reginald): I think I might have a minute. It better be good though.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Time is all we need.Ali (as Yashee): Great well, here’s something![Upbeat tune begins to play]Spurrier & Goodrich (singing): The ruins will ruin your day if you wind up here, find another way around the ruins, in the desert you’ll find a civilization left behind.  Ali (singing): The town seemed nice, we all got along. We made them a deal and wrote them a song. They showed us a rock, we bought the whole pitch, but everything changed when they brought out Mitch.  Spurrier & Goodrich (singing): Ruins will ruin your day if you wind up here, find another way around the ruins, in the desert you’ll find a civilization left behind.  Ali (singing): Fighting with Jairah, fierce and mean. We found ourselves trapped in a void with a fiend. We played our way out and the city collapsed, so running away was our only way past!  Spurrier & Goodrich (singing): Ruins will ruin your day if you wind up here, find another way around the ruins, in the desert you’ll find a civilization left behind.  Ali (singing): Out in the Stri we ran for our lives. Raz was a frog and followed behind. Surfing the sands was scary and new. We’ll never come back, and neither should you!  All (singing): Ruins will ruin your day-Kyle (as Symbol): Alright, stop stop! Just stop![Music ends abruptly]Goodrich: What?Kyle (as Symbol): You already ran off Reginald.[Someone laughs]Kyle: Which yeah, during your performance- towards the end of it he just disappeared in that same sand orb that he appeared in. Kind of like, he leaned over and whispered in Symbol’s ear and Symbol nodded-[Players laughing]Goodrich: “I’m gonna go.”Kyle: And then he was gone by the time it ended so-Goodrich: Classic.Kyle: Yeah, Symbol’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): You ran off Reginald, his main thing is that you were like giving caution about the ruins but it didn’t sound..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s a little Kids Bop Beetzart.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Which, maybe this is my own fault for not having talked to you about this sooner but uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We were just trying to lighten the mood-Kyle (as Symbol): No, no that’s fair!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): After the trail want and destruction we just left we thought we’d could maybe lighten the mood a little but-Kyle (as Symbol): There’s just no foreboding sense to the song but that’s okay, Reginald gave me a note which I think we could work on something on the ride to Basom. The real Basom I guess.Goodrich: (as Symbol): What it what this town was called? Maybe? Since it’s not Basom.Kyle: (as Symbol): Uh, Not Basom sounds like a good enough name to me. So, mark it on your map as Not Basom.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We can talk about changing the lyrics to Not Basom in that other song we wrote.[Players laugh and agree]Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah so um, I'm not Jairah so how about you tell me what happened? Cause I know I didn’t see anything when I touched the stone but you three kind of had a, agh moment whenever we touched the stone. So, what happened?Ali (as Yashee): I don’t know about you guys but my vision was pretty- pretty out there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I saw something you only see every once in a blue moon. If you get my- [laughs].Ali (as Yashee): I- I do get it! I do in fact!Goodrich: Lo-ho-ho-ho um-Ali (as Yashee): Couple different moons.Kyle (as Symbol): I don’t get it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Two moons, one blue one red.Kyle (as Symbol): Mhm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Floating- Fell-Spurrier (as Randy): There we uh, some pods.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Pods shooting in the air-Spurrier (as Randy): Rising-Ali (as Yashee): I remember that, yeah yeah yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay..Ali (as Yashee): Did you guys feel like the trembling? Kyle (as Symbol): You didn’t try to eat the pods did you?Ali (as Yashee): Oh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Kyle (as Symbol) Don’t eat pods.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah we- [laughs][Players laugh]Spurrier: Despite how tasty that look.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, you guys saw the pods, the moon falling, the ocean- the ocean-Ali (as Yashee): The tentacle?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): The tentacle-Ali (as Yashee): That was creepy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Okay so, I guess the three of us saw the same thing but yeah..Spurrier (as Randy): Well Symbol- Splash saw-Kyle (as Symbol): Symbol-Spurrier (as Randy): How long were we, aghhh, as you say?Kyle (as Symbol): Maybe like five seconds?[All players sound shocked]Kyle (as Symbol): Took a moment but-Ali (as Yashee): It felt like we were there like, in this moment of- I don’t know, worldly disaster?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: He pulls out a little journal and starts writing these things down.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay so, it felt like you were there-Goodrich: And I start looking over his shoulder and start writing down in my journal too like, ooh yeah right!Ali (Yashee): [Mumbles] Should we all be taking it out?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Mumbles] Take out your journals, guys.Ali (Yashee): [Mumbles] Do I even have my journal here with me?Spurrier: I never remember mine.Kyle (as Symbol): You should always have your journal with you, Yashee!Ali (as Yashee): Sorry![Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): That’s like part of your regular assignment, where is your journal?Ali (as Yashee): I honestly don’t know, I think it’s in the-[Goodrich laughing]Ali (as Yashee): I think it’s in the carriage.Kyle (as Symbol): Mitch!Kyle: And Mitch reaches in the carriage and he like rifles around and he holds out a journal and he’s like-Kyle (as Mitch): Is this it?Ali (as Yashee): That’s it, thanks Mitch!Kyle: He tosses it over, you catch it.Goodrich: Roll for it. [Laughs] no no no-Kyle: No no, you catch it we’ll keep this going.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, oh! And the tentacle grabbed the stone and it was the same stone that was-Ali (as Yashee): As we were dying, which was the craziest part!Kyle (as Symbol): Interesting..Ali (as Yashee): Like, oh my gosh! I mean, we’ve had some weird stuff going on lately but that was rough.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): So, from what I have down, basically you saw pods rise from the sky, you saw the two moons that- you know, just the normal two moons that are around right?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes.Ali (as Yashee): Themarcels?Kyle (as Symbol): Themarcels and Brubeck, right?Players: Yes.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay cool, um you were standing on a ceiling?Players: Yes.Ali (as Yashee): It was trembling like an earthquake or something.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We fell down somewhere.Ali (as Yashee): Fell into this, I dunno-Spurrier (as Randy): Hall or something-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): And you said at the end there was a stone that was holding..?Ali (as Yashee): A tentacle grabbed the stone.Kyle (as Symbol): And it was the same stone you were touching?All: Yes.Kyle (as Symbol): Interesting.Kyle: And he writes that down.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, and then we had our other experience with the bag-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh boy-Ali (Yashee): Like I was saying, weird stuff lately.Kyle (as Symbol): You mean the explosion?Spurrier (as Randy): I don’t know which ones weirder..Kyle (as Symbol): I know about the explosion I was there with you, it exploded and we had to run. That literally just happened, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): It was part of it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we got ourselves into kind of a - uh Wednesday casserole of a situation there too. It was kind of uh-Ali (as Yashee): Obviously we-[Players laughing]Spurrier (as Randy): Have we told you about Tabitha and that whole experience?Kyle (as Symbol): No, you haven’t told me anything in regards to Tabitha- isn’t that one of the other students?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh oh![Players laughing]Spurrier (as Randy): Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Randyy! [laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Kyle (as Symbol): Tabitha..Kyle: And he flips through-Kyle (as Symbol): Tabitha is in Christine’s class..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): With Garreth and Miss Blackblade?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah! Miss Blackblade, [pauses] I can call her Christine.[Players laugh]Spurrier: Well well well!Ali (as Yashee): We had a moment with Tabitha back at school.Kyle (as Symbol): Kind of a rival band thing or what?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s one way of putting it-Ali (as Yashee): Oh, just kind of uh, playing around practicing but um, she got kind of weird on us.Kyle (as Symbol): Weird?Ali (as Yashee): As if something was taking over like, possessing her for a moment.Kyle (as Symbol): Interesting, okay.Kyle: And he begins to write that down.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay so I mean, what happened? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Big, spooky voice. Thought it might have been a prank so we just kind of brushed it off. I mean, I know I did I don’t know about you guys.Kyle (as Symbol): So, this has to do with the explosion you were talking about-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right! Then the explosion happened. So, the explosion happened in the hall and that same voice came to us in like uh, a black..spacial void?Spurrier (as Randy): Sort of an empty space-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, it wanted us to create or something like that.Ali (as Yashee): I tried.Kyle (as Symbol): So, create-Spurrier (as Randy): We played him a song!Ali (as Yashee): We tried.Spurrier (as Randy): In front of these sweet pillars, right?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah-Spurrier (as Randy): These pillars of matter or something.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You guys all saw that too, right?[All players agreeing that they were there]Kyle: He is writing all this down in furious detail uh, and he’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay so, you played a song during the explosion?Spurrier (as Randy): Well, we were in a different plane? Maybe?Kyle (as Symbol): Oh okay, that actually- okay.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, cause when we came back it was like it had picked back up right where we left off.Kyle (as Symbol): Blink of an eye kind of thing?Ali (as Yashee): Like no time had passed.Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I appreciate you confiding in me with that. I- that's good to know um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Don’t tell Headmistress Greenspire! She might think we’re getting in trouble.Kyle (as Symbol): [Laughs] Don’t- please, don’t worry about that I would not do anything to get you or myself in further trouble [falls into a whisper] as I already am..[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): So, you said there was an entity talking to you. Uh, be wary I mean you guys when down into the club, you saw the other beings that were there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): There are other dimensions and beings that inhabit these dimensions; and some of them are you know, kind of just normal joes like you and me and-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Mitch?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, and Mitch over there and-Kyle: And Mitch kind of looks up and he’s like-Kyle (as Mitch): [Yelling] You talkin’ about me!?Kyle (as Symbol): No, Mitch don’t worry about it- keep preparing!Kyle: and he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): There are some- more malevolent forces out there that you need to be wary of, um-Goodrich: (as Raz’ul): Delarim![Silence]Spurrier: We’re just laying it all out on the table today, huh!?[Players laugh]Goodrich: I panicked!Kyle (as Symbol): Where did that name come from?Ali (as Yashee): I mean, does that name mean anything to you?Goodrich: Right.Kyle (as Symbol): I mean, Delarim is a name that- there's this cult from the southern plains of Alcan. They’re actually a cult that follows Darus Mur, it’s a titular name. It's a name that they use to reference the head of the organization.[All players “oooh”]Kyle (as Symbol): Where did you hear this name?Ali (as Yashee): [Quickly] Nowhere.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You remember Wesley, right?Kyle (as Symbol): No- oh, your song right!Ali (as Yashee): Our song, yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): The person who took you to Silk Grove and got you your strings yes, sorry. What about Wesley?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He said he wanted to show someone named Delarim that something could work and turns out boom goes the dynamite, the ettercap exploded and he got all mad.Kyle (as Symbol): Right.Spurrier (as Randy): And then he left.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Then he left while saying Delarim needs to see such and such and didn’t really go into detail.Spurrier (as Randy): It was brief.Kyle (as Symbol): You could have talk to me about this a lot sooner! I mean it’s good to let me know about the things that you find on your little misadventures and everything and-Spurrier (as Randy): We’re still new to school.Kyle (as Symbol): That’s fine you know, I mean is there any other information or things that you got in that whole first task that I sent you on?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Don’t be mad, Splash.Kyle: I’m not mad I just- I want to help out if I can. If you find something, you have a question, I'm your teacher. I'm more than happy to do what I can.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It seriously has been what, crazy couple of weeks? A month?Kyle: No, it’s only been about a- you’ve only been in school for about a week and a day-[Players sound shocked]Spurrier: Close enough.Kyle (as Symbol): I know it feels like a long time, I guess.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Especially when you’re dropped into other dimensions then apparently time doesn’t work the same way.Kyle (as Symbol): But enjoy it while you can cause it flies by fast.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): So, when did Delarim have to do with anything regarding the events?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): All that happened, man is that he said Delarim and he was upset that he couldn’t show him something and then that was it, he left.Kyle (as Symbol): But you went from talking about the entity in the void.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe they might have been related right?Kyle (as Symbol): Oh okay!Goodrich (as RAz’ul): I don’t know like, Delarim - and apparently there’s voids and dimensions and cults-Ali (as Yashee): Just more weird stuff that we’ve- we’ve heard of on the way.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I come from the forest, doc. I don’t know about all this stuff![Players chuckle]Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, that’s totally fair. Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We should probably get on the road! Right?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.Goodrich: Yeah, let’s go!Kyle (as Symbol): I think Mitch should be about ready-Kyle (as Mitch): [Yelling] Hey guys, I'm ready! You should get on over here!Kyle (as Symbol): That’s- that’s Mitch.Goodrich: That’s just Mitch.[All laughing]Kyle (as Symbol): That’s just on time.Goodrich: That’s our Mitch!Spurrier: Oh Mitch.Kyle: Alright, so you all ready to pack up and move on out and you’re done talking to Symbol. Nothing else you wanna mention to him? No other questions you have for him?Ali (as Yashee): Um, are there snacks in the carriage or?Kyle (as Symbol): Yashee..Yashee..Goodrich: [Chuckles] Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): It’s been a long day..Kyle (as Symbol): Yes, of course.Ali (as Yashee): Thanks.Kyle (as Symbol): Did you ever look under your seat?Ali (as Yashee): No! Nobody told me to.Kyle (as Symbol): See? That’s what happens, you need to investigate things as bards! Ah, another tip! another teacher tip! Be sure to investigate things.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean you’re talking to Symbol man, he’s the master of snackin’.Kyle (as Symbol): You might find more than there appears to be.Goodrich: Uh huh.Ali (as Yashee): Like more- more snacks?Kyle (as Symbol): [Laughs] Well, anything else that you find.Ali: I’ll just- [laughing]Goodrich: Randy and I just take Yashee’s hand and say, “Oh Yashee!”[All laughing]Kyle: Randy and Raz’ul take your hand and lead you to the carriage.Goodrich: As we walk into the sunset.Ali (as Yashee): Alright![Theme song plays]-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter2/22/19"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-12-a-basom-con-spirito,Ep. 12 – A Basom con Spirito!,"Ep. 12 – A Basom con Spirito![Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed! Let's recap last episode real quick. So, we started off with the bards having to escape from a collapsing tower, however that collapsing tower caused a chain reaction of collapsing buildings and a chase ensued- more of the bards running away from this uh, entire collapsing area. So, Symbol lead them through this town the best he could; Raz’ul morphed into a giant toad-Goodrich: And Mitch, too Kyle!Kyle: Oh yeah, there was Mitch there too.[Players laugh]Kyle: Mitch was running with Symbol, they were ahead of the group leading. Raz’ul turned into a giant toad, which Randy decided to ride atop. The trio ran through the town and they got their way through many obstacles, like avoiding collapsing buildings, boulders being flung from buildings crashing together, stampeding groups of jackal-weres, fruit carts, of course! You gotta have those-Spurrier: Naturally-Kyle: In any kind of running through a city, or chase. Uh, you got some back-alley barrel mazes, buckets of refuse being poured into the street and uh, ending in one of the most epic log rolling scenes I've ever been privy to be part of.[Players laugh]Kyle: Raz’ul with Yashee and Randy on his back was able to wall jump onto a tower that was rolling down a street. The tower began to crumble-Spurrier: Yup-Kyle: Which ended up them being able to surf down a sandy hill to the edge of town. They met up again with Symbol and Mitch at the end of town and uh, the horse and carriage were speeding towards the group wildly not being controlled. But, Raz’ul did a little speaking with animals and got to know Flotsam a little bit-Goodrich: [Happily] Yeah.Kyle: At this point Symbol came over and asked our bards, maybe you should write a song about this and you know, make sure people should know about this event. It’s kind of- kind of crazy what happened-Goodrich: This unknown town which apparently has no history what so ever-Kyle: Exactly-[Players laugh]Goodrich: And no one knows exists!Kyle: Well that’s the thing, documenting history, that’s your job as bards.Goodrich: That’s true.Kyle: You want to document everything that happens and this is something to be weary of if somebody were to come back in this area even though you destroyed it.Goodrich: This definitely should go in our little notebooks.Kyle: Yes!Goodrich: Discovered lost city, promptly destroyed it!Kyle: So, you were about to play the song that Symbol had been talking to you guys writing and then Reginald Brown showed up with your packages from Ema Zahn-Spurrier: [Softly] Hurray.Kyle: Randy and Yashee, you remember what you got right?Ali: [Hesitant] Uh, yeah!Spurrier: Yeah!Kyle: [Pauses] What did you get?[Players laugh]Spurrier: I got cheaters dice.Kyle: Yes.Ali: I got uh, a second bassinator-Kyle: Yes-Ali: And a potion, a divination potion.Kyle: Very good!Spurrier: Ding, ding, ding!Ali: She didn’t have anything in her store-Goodrich: Also, why is a school selling cheaters dice? It seems-Spurrier: I’m not using them on tests or anything.Goodrich: Well, as far as we know.[All laugh]Kyle: We’ll see, only time will tell. With Reginald Brown being there, Symbol had decided that you should actually play the song for Reginald. Unfortunately, the song that you wrote didn’t really give off the kind of vibe that goes along with like, one of our party got kidnapped-Goodrich: Yeah-Kyle: And we were in danger so, let’s write a jaunty tune. Which Symbol had a plan for resolving that for future methods, which we’re actually gonna cover starting in this episode. So, let’s go ahead and pick up- you all are getting ready to get back in the carriage, head off back in the direction of Basom, according to Mitch. So, you all pack in-Goodrich: As far as you freakin’ know-[Players laugh]Goodrich: We’re going to Basom, jeez.Kyle: Who knows! Mitch is driving; he’s wild, man![Players laugh]Goodrich: He’s a loose cannon!Kyle: So yeah, you get settled into the carriage and Symbol says-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay so, what I was going to talk to you about was the use of major versus minor keys. So, for every major key there is a relative minor. A minor key that shares the same key signature. So, for example, the relative minor to the key of C major is A minor.[Piano plays a few notes]Kyle (as Symbol): While a minor-[Notes continue on]Kyle (as Symbol): Yes, that’s-[Continues up and down the keys]Kyle (as Symbol): There you go.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, okay!Kyle (as Symbol): Great example, Randy. Thank you very much. Um,Goodrich: Using those cheaters dice.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Looking ahead.Kyle (as Symbol): So, keep that in mind going forward, If ever any opportunity arises that you need to maybe make something a little more foreboding, or sad sounding-Goodrich: [Softly] More sad-Kyle (as Symbol): You know, change the mood you know? You can use this-[Twinkle twinkle little starts plays but in a minor key]Kyle (as Symbol): You can play in a minor instead of a major.[Song flurries to a finish]Kyle (as Symbol): Yes-Ali (as Yashee): Did you just write that? It's beautiful[All laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): It’s a halfling folk song, it’s been around for ages.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): By Wolfgang Greentrees-[All laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Yes!Kyle: You talk about this for a little bit as the carriage is rolling on and eventually you get to a point where you get to rest a little bit. Maybe not sleep good cause it’s still in like, the afternoon time?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: But you travel for a good while and its many hours but eventually you hear Mitch say-Goodrich: Which is many hours like, a long rest many hours?Kyle: Yes.[Players sigh in relief and thank Kyle]Kyle: Yes, it is, so go ahead and, yeah- put your hit points back to full. Spells slots, do all that biz and get ready.Goodrich: Yeah, and really quick going forward, I realized that I had been subbing my proficiency bonus for my actual bonus in a skill so like-Kyle: Oh, that’s not good.Goodrich: No-Ali: [Giggles] Oh no-Goodrich: So, for instance my wisdom is plus two, my charisma is plus two and I’ve been doing plus three instead- instead of adding plus three plus two. So-Kyle: Does that mean you would have done better on those deception checks?Goodrich: Yeah, pretty much![Players laugh]Kyle: Really!?Goodrich: I’ve been playing with a handicap this whole time!Kyle: Oh man, which speaking of deception checks I'm pretty sure you need to write down in your flaws section that you are a pathological liar.Goodrich: [Pauses] Who, me?Kyle: Yeah-Ali: I think time has told that.[Players laugh]Kyle: I think Raz’ul is a pathological liar and that’s something that you’ve played into.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So, go ahead and write that in your flaws.Goodrich: Write down-Kyle: I’ve thought about it.Goodrich: Have successfully tricked Kyle into pathological lying Raz’ul.[Ali laughing]Goodrich: Fantastic! Okay, just so we know going forward so when you hear me say a plus five or something like that, that ones on me but-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Woo!Kyle: You hear Mitch call out and uh, he says-Kyle (as Mitch): [Yelling] Guys, I think we’re actually there! Why don‘t you guys take a look, check it out!Goodrich: [Groaning] Alright-Ali: I’d like to look for like a “Welcome to Basom” sign.[All laugh]Ali: Please-Goodrich: Does Basom fade like, fade onto the screen- the loading screen, the save icon comes up [laughs].Kyle: You look on top of a hill and like the Hollywood sign it says, “Basom.”Ali: Oh, thank god-Goodrich: Thank goodness.Spurrier: Sweet.Kyle: You know for sure, but no- you look out and it’s close to dusk. There's a glowing coming further south like, passed the town. You can see the town and you see adobe homes with staircases on the outside leading to like roof decks. They're covered by multi-colored material and blankets and stuff like that. Basically, just small adobe buildings that are circled around this oasis. So, there are a few people still in the streets you can see, and as the cart gets closer into town you start to, you know, get into the heart of the town and it comes to the circle that’s around the oasis. So, Symbol looks at you three and he knocks on the carriage wall and the carriage stops and he looks at you and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, I have to drop you off here cause-[Goodrich laughs]Kyle (as Symbol): People were expecting Luey Hewis-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can you drop us further down so we don’t get embarrassed?Kyle (as Symbol): No, you’re in the middle of the town at the oasis-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t want them all to see us getting dropped off!Kyle (as Symbol): Uh- oh okay I see![Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): I see- well, you’re not getting dropped off at school luckily, so it’ll be fine. But again, try to be nice, again these people are not fans of outsiders from my last recollection so, try not to find yourself on the wrong end of an argument. Furthermore, I want you to secure lodging for yourselves. I don’t care where, take this piece of paper-Kyle: And he hands you a rolled-up scroll that’s sealed with a wax symbol and everything on it.Goodrich: Is it his symbol or-Kyle: It-Spurrier: Symbol’s symbol?Goodrich: Mm!Kyle: It’s got a big “S” on it so-Goodrich & Spurrier: Splash-Ali: Splash- [Starts laughing][All burst out laughing]Kyle: Maybe! So uh, and he tells you-Kyle (as Symbol): Hand them this piece of paper to get signed. There's a tavern on the west side of town, if you want to go down the main road here and check out that. I believe it’s called The No Named Horse, you can see if you can get lodging there. And remember you’re here to gather information from anyone who has it about the meteor. Which should be a good challenge considering the peoples demeanors. So, you’re bards, you should be able to handle it or use this opportunity to improve your investigation skills. You know, really learn to rub an elbow and grease a palm if you have to. So, I'll contact you in the morning about where to meet and remember you’re with Luey Hewis, not Symbol.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right-Kyle (as Symbol): I’m not supposed to be here.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): So, don’t go yapping!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, you’re not even gonna be here anyways, I mean-Kyle: (as Symbol): I’m not here, you’re right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Where you gonna be while we’re doing this?Kyle (as Symbol): The people who are here to investigate the meteor site, which you’ll be meeting tomorrow, they’re expecting Luey today so uh- and while you’re out and about keep an ear out for anyone going by the names Whimpy or Boom Queen. They’re supposedly part of the crew that’ll be investigating the meteor site, they’re actually from the town and I'm meeting some of the bureaucrats that came in from Sundance. So, uh- go. Get out.[Players act like they’re rushing away]Kyle (as Symbol): I’ll see you later.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye, Splash!Spurrier (as Randy): Bye!Kyle: Okay, so you step out into this small desert town built around the oasis and the carriage starts to take off down the road further. And uh, you’re in the center of town standing at the oasis. You see a few people making their way through the streets, street merchants are closing down their shops for the day and you see a few kids that are playing tag close to the water where an old dwarf sits fishing quietly with a wry smile on his face. There are two primary roads that run north and south, east and west, they meet in the circle around the oasis- and again you can still see that glow even though you don’t have the vantage point you did coming into town, you can still see a glow coming in from the south and it gets brighter as the sun goes down.Goodrich: Right.Spurrier: [Curiously] Huh.Kyle: So, you hear the rabble of a tavern coming from the west, which is the direction Symbol was telling you it would be and uh, you guys can go from there. What do you want to do?Goodrich: I think I might go perform for the kids, maybe do some like prestidigitation in exchange for info? Like, birthday clown style or something?Kyle: Okay so you’re gonna-Goodrich: What do you guys wanna do?Ali: You said there was an old man fishing-Kyle: There’s an old- old dwarf fishing at the oasis.Ali: I might go and sit next to him and see if he’s caught anything- see if uh, he has any fish to sell or um, maybe just hang out.Kyle: Okay.Ali: I like fishing. [Giggles]Kyle: Anything from Randy?Spurrier: I think I might cast my mage hand in the water to make think he’s got a bite.Ali: Oh!Spurrier: But then he doesn’t.Kyle: Okay![Ali laughing]Spurrier: And then I yank his pole in.Kyle: Alright so uh, so I'll start with Raz’ul in this scene. What do you say or do as you approach these children?Goodrich: Right, so you said- what did you say they were doing? Playing with-Kyle: They’re playing tag.Goodrich: They’re- [chuckles]Ali: Minding their own business.[Players laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] Don’t make me feel bad, I just want to hang out with some cool kids! I’m like- I feel young at heart. [Sighs] Aw jeez, well I go over there and I- [laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hello there, children![Laughter continues]Kyle: They look scared, they look at you and just like, “Uhh” and start backing up-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No! No, no, no wait!Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Singing and playing guitar] Oh ho, ho it’s magic- [laughs] you know. Never believe it’s not so, children! It’s magic you know, never believe it’s not so! [Music stops]Goodrich: And I you know I'm putting out little, little prestidigitation stuff! Like uh, shower of sparks and- you know, just like hey let’s have some fun and it’s great! [Rolls dice]Spurrier: Trying to get your Gandalf on.Goodrich: Yeah, exactly!Kyle: They get freaked out and run!Ali: Oh, no! This is not a magical town!Kyle (as Child): Mom! Dad! No!Kyle: And they run away in fear.Goodrich: [Sighs] Well-Ali (as Yashee): Could have gone either way man-[All laugh]Goodrich: That’s true!Kyle: Um so-Goodrich: Raz’ul just hangs his head and says “aw.” I rejoin them, I guess!Kyle: Yeah you do this and uh, you turn around to see Yashee walking over to the dwarf fishing by the oasis. Yashee, as you approach the smell of fish just overwhelms your nose, I mean this guy-Ali: You mean like, good smell-Kyle: No, I mean it smells like dead fish-Ali: Dead fish?Kyle: Yeah, it kind of smells like... fish. Just in general. He looks up at you and it’s this really old dwarf, weathered face and everything, and he’s wearing this armor that has a symbol on it- basically like a fish looking upwards. He looks up at you and he says-Kyle (as Old Dwarf): [With a gruff and slightly Irish accent] Well hello young lady, what brings ya around these parts? You come to fish and hear the word of Fish-tus?Ali (as Yashee): Oh! I came for the first part, fishing. But, if you wanna talk to me while I’m checking out your fish.Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Yeah, absolutely! I have a lot to share, I'm actually an old retired cleric of the church of Fish-tus and uh, you know one of the things we live by is La-Fishtic-us 1611; don’t burn bridges where you can fish from them.Ali (as Yashee): Oh wow! I think I've heard of Fish-tus before, I traveled a lot as a kid but I never heard a lot about it so uh- cool!Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Well have a sit on down-Ali (as Yashee): Sure! Can I borrow your pole? Do you have another one?Kyle (as Old Dwarf): You know, if you want to take my pole go right ahead!Ali: Okay, sweet.Kyle: And he hands you the pole and at this point, Randy, your mage hand is going in and as soon as you grab hold of it there’s a tug and he goes-Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Oh ay’ lass, you got one on there right away! Go on and pull it in and fill the bounty of Fish-tus!Ali: Alright, so I start yanking it back. Do I need to make a strength roll?Kyle: Yeah, go ahead and roll me a strength roll and we’ll say Randy that’ll be against your spell save-Spurrier: Okay!Kyle: For the really weird alteration of rules but that’ll work for it.Ali: Okay well, I rolled a thirteen.Kyle: What’s the spell save?Spurrier: For rogue it’s eleven.Kyle: Alright yeah so, you pull and it’s like just a empty hook, there’s nothing on it.Goodrich: I’m just splashing around in the water like, “this just isn’t my day!”Kyle: He’s not around.Goodrich: No, I walked back over to them I said.Kyle: No, I mean Splash, I was making a joke.[Players laugh]Kyle: See? There’s me buying into that.Goodrich: Yeah, for real.Kyle: Um so, yeah no you pull and there’s nothing at the end of the hook and the old dwarf just goes-Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Ah, well ain’t that the way sometimes? Sometimes the Fish-tus gives and Fish-tus takes away.Ali (as Yashee): Well, maybe this isn’t the Fish-tus for me.Kyle (as Old Dwarf): I guess not.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Well um, you and your friends look like fresh faces, what brings ya ‘round?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, you’re not from here? You said?Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Ah no, I am from a different place. I don’t know how to explain where I've ended up or how I’ve gotten to where I am. Of course, working with the god Fish-tus I'm taken where I'm needed.Goodrich: Right-Kyle (as Old Dwarf): And in such a town as this with a nice oasis so nice in the middle of it, it’d be terrible for them not to have the boon of fish just because it’s in the middle of the desert. So, Fish-tus has provided me the blessing to this town, which is uh- I'm probably the newest person that’s been accepted into this society, and even then I'm on an outskirt in a way.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, we’ve been warned about folks that live around here. Apparently not so friendly? What's your experience? Cause you know we’ve- our source of information is uh.. You know!Spurrier (as Randy): Sketchy at best.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Okay, okay I apologize let’s start off with this. I didn’t catch any of your names.Ali (as Yashee): I’m Yashee!Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Yashee.Spurrier (as Randy): Randy.Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Randy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And I’m Mac.Kyle: Roll me a deception check!Goodrich: Yup! [Laughs and rolls a dice] Oh, so that’s a fourteen plus five, nineteen.Kyle: He says-Kyle (as Old Dwarf): Ah, well Yashee, Randy, Mac pleasure to meet you my names Dogum, Dogum Brewsocks.Kyle: And you see he reaches over to a small tankard nearby, pulls a sock out of it, switches it back onto his foot which has been hanging off in the water. He pulls it out of the water-[Goodrich shutters]Kyle: Does that and then puts his boot back on and is like-Kyle (as Dogum): Ay, save it for the brew later.Kyle: So, and he reaches for that tankard and takes a big sip out of it, puts it back down and is like-Kyle (as Dogum): So, you’re worried about the townspeople not being too keen on you, ay?Spurrier (as Randy): Yes-Goodrich: (as Raz’ul): Hey real quick, what are you drinking?Kyle (as Dogum): Uh, a family special of the Brewsock.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s that about?Kyle (as Dogum): It’s a beer brewed infused with sweat of my pride, and my family and all of our determination and honor.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Does it taste like pride, determination and honor or just like, feet-Kyle (as Dogum): Well, you’re a dwarf, why don’t you tell me? Take a drink.Goodrich: Uhhhhh![Ali and Spurrier chanting “do it!”]Kyle (as Dogum): Come on, lad.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Sighs] Alright, give it here.Goodrich: And I-Spurrier (as Randy): Come on, Mac![Ali laughing]Spurrier (as Randy): You a tough boy!Kyle (as Dogum): Let’s go Mac.Goodrich: Uh so- do I need to roll anything?Kyle: Roll me a constitution check, yeah.Goodrich: Oh jeez. [Rolls dice] So, fifteen plus one sixteen.Kyle: Okay so, you knock back a little bit of the brew and it’s like a really really sour beer.Goodrich: I can imagine-Kyle: It does not taste that great. I mean, you’re not sipping enough to get intoxicated-Goodrich: No-Kyle: But, you probably don’t care for it too much-Goodrich: No, and I don’t say as much but I put it down and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah! I see what you’re going for!Kyle (as Dogum): Ay, takes a refined palette.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Hesitant] Yeah, probably.Kyle: He winks at ya.Goodrich: I wink back! I guess? [Laughs]Kyle (as Dogum): So I mean, regarding the people in the town, you’re asking about them being a little bit unsavory towards outsiders. This is true, like I've said I've been giving the boon of Fish-tus's blessing onto this town for- [sighs] maybe twenty, twenty-five years now.Goodrich: Whoa.Spurrier: Wow!Kyle (as Dogum): Somewhere in that range. Laddie, you’ll see soon enough as you get older in age the time just kind of wears on.Goodrich: Right.Kyle (as Dogum): You know, I finally got into the good graces and they don’t like outsiders mainly because of the bureaucracy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You got any tips for uh, skating around that sort of business or-Kyle (as Dogum): Uh, well why are you here? If you’re here for the other reasons that people are here, they might not be too keen on ya.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Why are other folks here?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We were just dropped off here.Kyle (as Dogum): Well we’ve had some bureaucrats in to investigate the meteor site down south in the Glow Fields.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Have you been down there?Kyle (as Dogum): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No?Kyle (as Dogum): No, I haven’t. I stay here and tend to the oasis.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s the word on the street about this meteor?Kyle (as Dogum): Well, the big thing that’s happen that's really caused a dampering on the town is uh…the vibration of the impact has closed down the main mine west of town. So, people haven’t been able to work and they’re a little up in arms about it. They've been trying to contact people in Sundance to get down here and help clear up the mine so they can get back to work, providing glass wears that this town has grown famous for. So, a lot of people are on edge because they ain’t getting to work, and if they ain’t getting to work they ain’t getting their money. If they ain’t getting their money they ain’t getting their drink and food you know what I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And their... foot beer. Yeah.Kyle (as Dogum): Oh no, that’s mine.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey you know what? You could find a market for that.Kyle (as Dogum): The market’s closed right now-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No listen-Kyle (as Dogum): They’re closing up shop-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I feel like we’re getting off track here. Uh, we were just passing through, we were thinking about just checking out the meteor just cause we heard tell. We actually saw the thing streaking across the sky, didn’t we guys?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, it was beautiful.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It was great and you know I uh-Kyle (as Dogum): Ay, must have been up late at night then.Ali (as Yashee): Well we’re a band so we play a lot of like, evening gigs?Kyle (as Dogum): Oh really? You’re a band- Well then maybe perhaps maybe you’d do better than Fibblewix McFlibbs over in the tavern. That boy could use a lesson, I tell ya, he’s something terrible.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What's he play?Kyle (as Dogum): Ha! I don’t say he plays anything but he tries to play lute. So perhaps you there, little Mac, you could give him a lesson or two; make him a little bit better. Poor boy has tried to get into Strumlotts more often than not and keeps getting refused.Goodrich: Aw.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We just showed up, did he maybe not go to the right Strumlotts? We didn’t even have to do anything.Kyle (as Dogum): No, he got some letter from the underground piping system that said uh-Goodrich: Don’t even bother [laughs]Kyle (as Dogum): It was pretty brief, from what I heard it just said “no.”Ali (as Yashee): Well-Kyle (as Dogum): All eight times.Ali (as Yashee): Oh Gosh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, the tavern is over in the west right?Kyle (as Dogum): Yeah, you head down this main road here just to the west. It's called the No Named Horse.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You wanna come with?Kyle (as Dogum): Oh no I tend here. I got my camp, I've got my brew, the food, the fish, I'm all set here. I'm here to tend to the oasis I don’t uh, I don’t stray too far otherwise the fish dry up.Spurrier (as Randy): Right, well enjoy your Fish-tus.Kyle (as Dogum): I will!Spurrier (as Randy): Good.Kyle (as Dogum): I will, Fish-tus be with you.Spurrier (as Randy): And also, with you.Kyle (as Dogum): If you ever need anything come back and see me, you’ve got a good place with me in my heart at least with Fish-tus is giving so-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But no actual place to stay.Kyle (as Dogum): I have a tent we could share, it’s a little small.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ll take our chance with the horse’s no name.Ali (as Yashee): At least we know if we need to come back, we can.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah.Kyle (as Dogum): Alright.Spurrier (as Randy): Byee!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Byee!Kyle: So, you begin heading down the road to The No Named Horse and the second alleyway that you pass by a person stumbles out and runs clean into Yashee. And they fall onto the ground and you just see a human woman, sitting there in a pile of messy cloaks and she looks up at you, and has bright red cheeks and her nose is really bright red, her eyes are half-closed. She scowls a moment then looks up at you Yashee and she says-Kyle (as Drunk Woman): [With a very drunken, slurred tone] H-hey! You ran into me, w-what kinda person does that!? Are you like, even from around here? Well it’s time you learned some rules if you know what's good for you- knock someone down, you have to buy ‘em a drink it’s [hic] the law of the land.Ali (as Yashee): You okay? You look like you're sick or something.Kyle (as Drunk Woman): Nnno, I got knocked down by- by a big person and you can buy me a drink.Ali (as Yashee): Who- who knocked you down on the ground?Kyle (as Drunk Woman): You got in my way-Ali (as Yashee): Oh!Kyle (as Drunk Woman): I was walkin’ and.. You ran right into my way and knocked me down, now you gotta buy me a drink. Do you wanna take- do you wanna take me to the tavern?Ali (as Yashee): I think we’re heading to the tavern anyway, although-Kyle (as Drunk Woman): Ahh yes! Yesh, friend! Yesh, let’s go to the tavern!Ali (as Yashee): We’ll- we’ll see I don’t know about the drink I mean I... we have stuff that we need to take care of.Kyle (as Drunk Woman): [Softly] But she knocked me down... are you even gonna help me up?Ali (as Yashee): You almost knocked me over- yeah, sure.Ali: And I pick her straight up.[Kyle yelps]Goodrich: Just set her on her feet?[All laugh]Ali (as Yashee): There you go bud!Kyle (as Drunk Woman): Yer- yer a strong one.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah but uh, so, I didn’t knock you down I'm just- I'm just so strong.Goodrich: [Italian accent] I’m walkin’ here! That's what you should have said.[All laugh]Kyle: Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Way to blend in, Yashee.Kyle (as Drunk Woman): Let’s go to the tavern, get the drink.Ali (as Yashee): Can I buy myself a drink too or-Kyle (as Drunk Woman): And me a drink! It's the law of the land.Goodrich: Raz’ul falls over and says-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Now you gotta buy me a drink too, Yashee!Ali: Aw, damnit!Spurrier: And I take a running jump and just go flying-Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, you’ve knocked me down as well![All laugh, overlapping excited coversation]Kyle (as Drunk Woman): Drinks all around!Spurrier (as Randy): Thanks, Yashee!Kyle (as Drunk Woman): You said her name is Ya-shee-shee? Ya-shur-shur...Ali (as Yashee): Well that’s- that’s close.[Laughter continues]Kyle (as Drunk Woman): Let’s go, The No Named Tavern is right- right down here. Let’s get from- a drink from Dewey.Kyle: So Yashee you go around and you help everyone up onto their feet since you knocked them down and now you have to buy them all drinks.Ali: I feel terrible![Players laugh]Kyle: So, you’re heading off- she puts her arms around Randy and Raz’ul and really slouches over to walk-Goodrich: Yeah, she’s like down really low-Ali: You’re just like, dragging her-[All laughing]Goodrich: We’re just like, dragging her behind us!Kyle: She’s just holding onto the back of your cloaks and her feet are dragging and she’s just like-Kyle: (as Drunk Woman): This is great!Goodrich: Ahh! Mesh, mesh!Kyle: So uh, you make your way to The No Named Horsed with this person in tow. And as you approach the tavern you hear the rabble of people arguing and some pretty simplistic music being strummed out. When you step inside, that typical thing of when you step into a bar happens where everyone goes quiet. And the music stops but that’s only because the person playing it messed up and uh-[Players chuckle]Kyle: And uh, but all eyes are on you and after a second a human man clears his throat and stands up. His clothes are worn, he has patches sewn onto them, which you notice to be the case with most of the people around the table that he’s at. He finishes off his mug and wipes the foam from his short bristly beard and says-Kyle (as Man): [In a low gruff tone] Well, I reckon this conversation should be shelved for the time being. Everyone should get some rest; we still need to do what we can to re-open the mine. Especially since them bureaucrats in Sundance won’t send any aid short of those that are here for the sky boulder. We’ll all reconvene another time when it’s appropriate.Kyle: And he looks at you three. So, the man turns and starts talking to a woman to his left, you notice behind her sits a woman with a pair of crutches leaning against the wall next to her. The others rise from their seat and begin to disperse, some leaving, and some cozying up into their own table with a mug; but all are eyeballing you in a very strange fashion. And it’s at this time you hear a dwarf call from behind the bar, says-Kyle (as Dewey): [in a low gravelly tone] You know what a tavern is, right? What’dya lookin’ for you three? Food? Drink- you didn’t bring Big Shot in here did you!? Is that who you have dragging behind you!? You better be here for food, drink or lodging, if you’re not there’s the door.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Don’t know a Big Shot, she probably had a big shot though.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Dewey): Yeah, that’s Big Shot right there-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Dewey): You bet- is somebody buying her her drinks? Her tabs full here.Ali (as Yashee): I got her on for one.Kyle: Big Shot stands up, she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah Dewey, they’re gonna get me a drink so just you know, the bottle!Kyle: And waves it over-Goodrich: Can I whisper to Yashee-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Whispers] Of water, of water! Tell him it’s water she wants.Ali (as Yashee): Yes! Your biggest glass of- [whispers] of water.Kyle: You say this and Big Shot looks as you and she’s just like-Kyle (as Big Shot): No! Not water, I can get water in the oasis I’ll just drink that-Ali (Yashee): No, I mean you didn’t like, specify!Kyle (as Big Shot): Dewey! The stuff! The good stuff!Ali (as Yashee): I don’t know if you should- I mean, you seem like you’re good-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Big Shot): You knocked me down, you gotta buy me a drink- ask Dewey! It’s the law of the land!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You didn’t specify the kind of drink-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah!Spurrier: At this point, Randy pulls out his organ and starts to play [singing while playing soft piano music] Please don’t spoil this bar, so drunk you are, and after all you’re finally sleeping.Goodrich: [Hums after][All chuckle]Kyle: Alright, I think you roll to see how many-Spurrier: 5d8.Kyle: [With horror] Oh my god.Goodrich: You’re casting sleep, I guess?Spurrier: Yeah, to see if it’s enough hit points to make them sleep so- if everyone could roll a d8.Kyle: And then roll an extra.Spurrier: Roll an extra.[Multiple dice rolling]Goodrich: One, four, one and six.Spurrier: And- [rolls dice] two.Ali: Fourteen.Kyle: She passes out.Spurrier: Hurray!Kyle: She just falls onto the ground, passes out. Dewey goes-Kyle (as Dewey): Ah, I think ya dodged a bullet with that one uh you know, Big Shot can really knock ‘em down if ya know what I mean.Goodrich: I put one of the sapphires we got from Wesley- should be like a hundred gold- I put it on the counter and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, make sure she gets taken care of.Kyle (as Dewey): Uh, you got it.Kyle: And he takes it and puts it in his pocket.Ali: Her tab.Goodrich (as Dewey): You know, I pay for her tab, I think. Make sure she’s got a room, just-Kyle (as Dewey): Ah, she’s got a house. Somebody will make sure she gets there, and we’ll make sure her tab is taken care of, appreciate that. So, you getting food?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah-Kyle (as Dewey): Lodging, I only have one room I hope that’s okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s fine.Spurrier (as Randy): We got a paper- who's got the paper?[Everybody repeating, “who's got the paper”]Goodrich: I pat myself down.Ali: Raz’ul?Goodrich: I think you had the paper, Randy.Spurrier: Oh! Well I reach in; I pull out the paper and I say uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Dewey, right?Kyle (as Dewey): Yeah, it’s Dewey.Spurrier (as Randy): Here you go.Kyle: Alright, so he grabs the scroll that you hand to him, and he looks at it and pulls the seal off and unfurls it.Kyle (as Dewey): [Reading] To whom it concerns, the bards- [groans] bards!? I already have one too many bards here!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well we’re other things too!Kyle (Dewey): Yeah-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Not just bards-Kyle (as Dewey): Okay, okay- anyway it says here basically, the bards presenting this document have been charge with finding lodging under their own abilities. Only permit them lodging if you deem their performance deserving and shovel them off if not. Thank you for indulging us in the training of our future historian story tellers, entertainers, signed Symbol HMAC.Spurrier (as Randy): Splash, he signed it wrong.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, he goes by Splash now.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s a habit.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s probably an old one-Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, that’s what it is!Ali: Mhm!Kyle (as Dewey): I remember that boy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That- that boy?Kyle (as Dewey): Coming through here many, many years ago.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Excited] What was he like!?Goodrich: I put my elbows on the bar and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What was he like!?[Players laugh]Kyle (as Dewey): He’s a fantastic performer, probably the best we’ve had come through but we haven’t seen him in decades. Man, anyway so anything you can do to help me um let’s see, that boy over there- that halfling boy- if you can teach him anything you know about music, something to make him a better bard- if you’d even call him a bard.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well really, anyone can be a bard.Kyle (as Dewey): Not according to them bureaucrats up in Sundance. They have a real set line for school.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean it’s all about hard work, practice and determination.Kyle (as Dewey): Yeah but with their line from the school to the Bureau of Better Barding you know, but if you can make him a better performer, I'll give you a room and I’ll sign the paper for your teacher.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Ali (as Yashee): I think we can handle that.Spurrier (as Randy): Deal!Kyle: So yeah, there’s a halfling sitting over by the hearth strumming on a lute, really simplistic stuff. So, you walk up and he’s putzing around on chords and everything and uh, you notice he’s messing up and he’s saying some words under his breath but he stops for a moment and notices you standing there and he goes-Kyle (as Fibblewix): [In a higher-toned voice, sounds like a young boy] Oh, hi! Um-Spurrier (as Randy): You’re Gillyfingers McFingerbones right?[Players attempt to hold back laughing]Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Distressed] It’s Fibblewix Mcflibbs-Spurrier (as Randy): I was close.[Laughter]Kyle (as Fibblewix): That was kind of rude.. Alright.Spurrier (as Randy): I like that. Can I just call you Fingerbones?[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Laughing] Randy, be nice!Kyle (as Fibblewix): I don’t have any bony fingers though- that's why I'm having a hard time playing- some little stubby ones.Spurrier (as Randy): We can shave off some.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Laughing] We’ve actually got some spare fingers if you need some-Ali (as Yashee): I have two!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s step one, you need a good stage name, one that people will remember.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay.. So, lesson one-Kyle: And he stops and he pulls out a little thing, he’s like-Kyle (as Fibblewix): I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Laughing] We’re just playing with you, listen-Kyle (as Fibblewix): You look like bards-Ali (as Yashee): We are!Kyle (as Fibblewix): You don’t happen to go to Strumlotts do you?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sometimes. We really haven’t been there a whole lot recently but- [laughs]Kyle (as Fibblewix): Sometimes? Okay, uh well I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we’ve been around Strumlotts.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Do you- do you have a good word in? I've tried to get into Strumlotts for a while just- [sighs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Have you ever heard of a guy named Symbol?Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Excited] Yeah! Who hasn’t heard of Symbol?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He’s going by Splash now, that’s the first thing you should know.Kyle (as Fibblewix): That’s- that’s a weird name change.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s his nick name- rebranding.Kyle (as Fibblewix): That’s better than..fingerbones.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhhhh, well anyways, we were sent over here to maybe help you out a little bit if that’s cool-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Oh, really!?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Kyle (as Fibblewix): You guys wanna help me finish writing my song about Tibbledy Tom Titomalon?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): See, this is exactly what we’re talking about.Spurrier (as Randy): Absolutely.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay, maybe you can come up with- you can help me come up with some verse- here's- lemme play- lemme what I got for you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay-Kyle (as Fibblewix): So far real quick-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s see what you got.Kyle (as Fibblewix): And see if you can jam along to this. Um, [softly] one, two, three, four- [singing and playing lute] Tibbley Tom Titomalon was running down the lane. He fell down and broke his leg and we’re laughing once again. [“Ha’s” to the rhythm of the song, joined by the rest of the players]Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah that was good-Ali (as Yashee): Very catchy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s wrong with that? That's perfectly fine, it’s a great song-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Well I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You should be very happy with that song-Kyle (as Fibblewix): I mean, more- more lines- the only other one I have for it is- here lemme try this one for you. [Singing while playing lute] Tibbley Tom Titomalon was going on his first date, went to his dad to get some advice and caught him masterbat- [All loudly “ha”ing to the rhythm of the song]Kyle (as Fibblewix): So, well I guess I don’t have good words-[Players “no” repeatedly]Ali (as Yashee): They’re a little rough.Spurrier (as Randy): We can polish them.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Well, do you wanna try writing a verse and we can play it around? I mean, I'm really trying to play something a little more cheerful and up-light for the people around here cause everyone seems so down.Goodrich: (as Raz’ul): What are you talking about? That’s a perfectly cheerful song, it’s downright delightful-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah but nobody's like, responding to it. I just- I dunno maybe if the words-Ali (as Yashee): Maybe if there was a little more going on you know? Just you and your guitar over there so.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well what does this crowd usually listen to? Are you it?Kyle (as Fibblewix): I..yeah.Ali & Goodrich: Oh.Kyle (as Fibblewix): So, I mean-Goodrich: And I kind of look at him and I put my hand on his shoulder and I'm like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Don’t you let anyone put you down cause you’re a bard, son.Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Excitedly] Oh man, you think I'm a bard!?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You ARE a bard! Look, you wrote a great song! And just because these chumps don’t think it’s a good one doesn’t mean it’s not a great song. It's a great tune, man you got a lot of cool stuff happening in that tune!Kyle (as Fibblewix): Thanks uh, maybe- I don’t know, if you guys help me write lyrics maybe they’d like them better. I don’t-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Let’s try it out.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well first off, give me your guitar-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So we can tune that bad boy. Yup, yup [straining] there we go. Alright, so we’ll get this tuned up here- ah that’s way up. Anyway, I'll tune this up for you and then we can help you out with some lyrics, right?Kyle (as Fibblewix): Mkay.Kyle: Well, so what we’re gonna do here for above the table is we’re gonna take five minutes, write your line that you’re gonna do, each of you write a line and then we’re gonna come back and play it sooo get writing![Electronic music plays]Kyle: [with accent] Five minutes later.[Music fades out]Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay so um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I got your guitar all tuned up, you’re good to go there.Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Strums a few chords] That sounds- whoa!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, imagine that.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Whoa-Ali (as Yashee): It’s all about the basics, foundation, man-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Thanks, Raz’ul!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah, absolutely-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Lesson two, tune your guitar.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay, noted. Um well, Yashee do you want to start us off and then maybe Randy and then Raz’ul?Ali (as Yashee): Sure!Spurrier (as Randy): Sure!Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay, I'll start playing and see how it goes.[Players agree]Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Softly] Two, three-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Help us out on the chorus.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay, yeah!Spurrier: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!Kyle (as Fibblewix): one, two, three, four-[Plays an upbeat tune on guitar]Ali (singing): Tibbley Tom Titomalin was cooking up a meal, grabbed a pan and burned his hand and now he cannot feel.[“Ha’s” to the rhythm of the song, joined by the rest of the players]Kyle & Goodrich: Randy.Spurrier (singing): Tibblity Tom Titoberon walked out into the road-Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Softly] That’s not his name-Spurrier (singing): He heard a bird and looked straight up and walked into a commode.[“Ha’s” to the rhythm of the song, joined by the rest of the players]Goodrich (singing): Tibbty Tangled Tumbleboy-Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Softly] That’s not his name-Goodrich (singing): Was bathing in the stream, a witch jumped down and cast a spell as he began to scream.[“Ha’s” to the rhythm of the song, joined by the rest of the players, song ends]Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah that was pretty good- you got the names wrong but you know, whatever! Ya'll were having fun with it, right?[Players happily agree]Goodrich: Does the crowd respond, Kyle?Kyle: Uh, you look around, everybody's kind of like eyeballing you really hard just like groaning and rolling their eyes and everything-Goodrich: More bards! [Groans] Oh, god!Kyle: And-Goodrich: The last thing this town needs.Kyle: You look over at Dewey and he’s just got this like, “no.” And he pushes off the bar and you see him basically like glide across the bar to get something. It doesn’t look like he walks-Spurrier: Huh! Spirit!Kyle: And then he grabs something and glides back and slides it down for a patron.Goodrich: Is he a ghoul?Kyle: You don’t know!Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: But yeah, so yeah Fibblewix McFlibbs looks at you three, he’s like-Kyle (as Fibblewix): See this is what I'm talking about like, it doesn’t matter if you get good words. You got the good chords, I mean Raz’ul you said I had a good song.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, you’re songs freakin’-Kyle (as Fibblewix): You went to bard college so you know, I trust you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, your songs a freakin’ jam dude.Kyle (as Fibblewix): I just wish I knew what I could, you know-Spurrier (as Randy): I mean we did just learn some new stuff. How to change the feel and flow of the song.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah?Ali (as Yashee): Honestly, if they’re not responding to this like, happiness of a tune then maybe they’re not feeling the happy vibes.Spurrier (as Randy): And things haven’t been too happy around here, right?Kyle (as Fibblewix): No, they haven’t. Everyone’s really ticked off.Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe they need some empathy or sympathy.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, something they can relate to a little.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, you got the goods but is it the right goods so-Spurrier (as Randy): Can we tweak those goods?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah! Give me your notes![All laughing and making weird noises]Spurrier: Ol’ Fingerbones.Goodrich: Oh Fingerbones.Spurrier: You wiley boy.Kyle: That’s right.[Players laugh]Spurrier: No listen, let’s work on it together- we'll give it a shot and see what happens.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Okay!Kyle: Alright so, let’s roll some chord dice. See if we can’t make Fibblewix’s song a bit better.[Electronic music plays]Kyle: Okay guys so let’s have a “minor” discussion real quick.[Players “oooh!”]Kyle: In all seriousness though uh, we wanna talk to you listeners about the differences of major versus minor just to, you know, bring that up cause our bards are gonna be able to start using that to write songs. Ya'll are gonna be able to choose-Goodrich: Exactly-Kyle: Weather to choose major or minor based off the situation.Goodrich: Cool!Kyle: So uh, Spurrier if you don’t mind doing me the favor- let's just talk about C major compared to A minor. I’m gonna go ahead and just let you lead off with that.Spurrier: Okay so, if you guys envision a piano- you just thinking of playing all the white notes- do happen to just start on C [plays a scale on the piano] go to another C and come back. [Plays a few notes together]Goodrich: C major!Spurrier: Good old C major!Goodrich: You’ve heard it a million times on BomBARDed!Kyle: See? That was major.[Players chuckle]Spurrier: And so, if you go up to the sixth note, which is [playing as he speaks] C, D, E, F, G, A and you still stick with all the white notes but start here instead. [Plays a scale on the piano] you get minor. Um, but one really important thing that’s going to affect all our minor songs, if I go back to major just super-fast then I stop [plays minor scales] then I stop right before the end [stops playing] then there’s tension-Goodrich: Ugh, whats gonna happen!Spurrier: [Straining] I really want it to go- [plays single note] there! Right?Kyle: You want it to resolve.Spurrier: You want it to resolve, right. There's that tension there, and if I do it with A minor again. [Plays scales] and stop right before the end- [stops playing] it doesn’t feel finished-[All agreeing softly]Spurrier: There’s not that tension, it doesn’t want to go there. [Playing single note repeated] So that’s a G, so if I raise that G to a G-sharp [plays a scale with the end note being much higher] there’s that tension, right?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: It really wants to go there-Goodrich: It’s the old harmonic minor and I think we’re saying that Splash told us all about that on the way to Basom so we know how to do that as characters and stuff.[All agreeing]Spurrier: The whole point being- just so everyone knows, we roll our dice- if we happen to an E we have a right to make it E minor or E major, be that G or G-sharp.Goodrich: The expressed right, it is our decision!Spurrier: That’s what- yeah exactly.Ali: We have the power!Kyle: Yeah, exactly you can choose. Normally when you write a song your- the chord dice roll is book ended by C major on both sides-[Players agreeing]Kyle: But in the situation you want to roll a- uh, play in minor you’ll just book end it with A minor instead so. That'll help us keep things rolling, literally-Spurrier: Aah!Goodrich: Ahh!Kyle: So, a couple examples that Spurrier has where he’s switching either major to minor- and these are gonna be songs you know, I hope- or minor to major. So Spurrier if you don’t mind-Spurrier: Yeah! Here is Joy to the World in its standard major form. [Plays Joy to the World] and then I'll adjust a few notes and now- [Plays Joy to the World in minor key]Kyle: Oh no.Spurrier: Just here- so yeah, so foreboding and-Kyle: Now it’s Tears to the World-Spurrier: [Chuckles] Tears to the World, all over the world! And then if we go the other way we’ll get something by ol’ beef oven. [Plays Fur Elise by Beethoven] and then we change a few notes- [Plays Fur Elise but in major key]Kyle: [Sighs happily] I really like that.Spurrier: Yeah!Goodrich: Just a breath of fresh air.Spurrier: Exactly, so yeah! There you go-Goodrich: It’s kind of an example of how major and minor stack up to each other. Both very nice but uh, different kind of vibes coming off them.Kyle: Yup! Speaking of which, since we kind of explained that vibe lets go ahead and roll some dice and we can figure out how you’re going to add to his song.Spurrier: So, Kyle just to make sure-Kyle: Yeah?Spurrier: We’re gonna take the original thing by Twiddildy Fingerbones and make that minor and add on a new section, right?Kyle: Yes-Spurrier: And that’s based on the chord dice we roll? Cool!Kyle: Yeah-Spurrier: Combo song!Goodrich:  Combo song!Spurrier: We’ve never done that, alright cool-[Dice rolling]Goodrich: C-c-c-combo song! [imitates air horn][All gasping]Kyle: All Wild!?Goodrich: Double wild!Goodrich & Spurrier: And a triple wild!Goodrich: Quit with the wilds.[Dice rolls]Goodrich: Oh jeez, okay. Oh well, that’s two-Kyle: Oh my god![Players “whoa!”]Spurrier: Extreme!Kyle: So, you basically rolled B diminished and G.Goodrich: Yeah-Spurrier: We rolled B diminished three times over.[All chuckle]Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: That’s amazing.Ali: Well, at least we have- we have our A minor.Goodrich: Okay drums-Ali: Alright-Goodrich: Do it!Ali: Righto, alright coin toss! [Coin hits the table] ‘Kay it’s head.Goodrich: Heads!Ali: Picking our first bank-Ali: We’ve got a twenty-six.Goodrich: [Softly chanting “Blues”]Ali: Rock ten!Goodrich: Alright!Spurrier: Close enough.Ali: And Fusion two.[Players chuckling and Kyle “hmms”]Goodrich: Rock Fusion.[Spurrier humming a tune, Goodrich start scatting]Kyle: Rock Fusion, ha![Music transitions]Goodrich: Hey everyone it’s Goodrich, surprise! Uh, we were so pumped to jam with Fingerbones this session that we forgot to record Kyle’s middle bits so instead, here I am!

Maybe?Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah, I'll- I mean it’s just ha’s to la’s.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean you kind of got it down, you kind of got the feel down for how the chorus goes-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Ha’s to la’sGoodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah hope in on that chorus,  yeah you got it.Kyle (as Fibblewix): Yeah! Show me what you got!Ali (as Yashee): Sweet![Drums start up, band immediately begins after]All (Singing): Tibbledy Tom Titomalon looked up into the sky, saw a falling meteor and thought that he might die.[“La’s” to the tune of the song]  All (Singing): Tibbledy Tom Titomalon got shut out of the mine, couldn’t buy himself a drink or pay his rent on time.[“La’s to the tune of the song]All: Hey!All (Singing): Tibbledy Tom, Tomalon; you’re gonna survive so just hold on![Kyle starts a lute solo; other players cheer him on]Kyle (as Fibblewix): I don’t know what’s happening to Fingerbone’s Fingerbones!Ali (as Yashee): Get it!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Look at him go, look at him go! Get it, son!Ali (as Yashee): Shred them bones!Kyle (as Fibblewix): I got blisters on my fingerbones!  All (Singing): Tibbledy Tom Titomalon got up from where he sat, he said it’s time to get things done and face the bureaucrats.[Overlapping “La’s” to the tune of the song]All: Hey![Music ends]Kyle (as Fibblewix): Aw man, that was- that was awesome!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Shouting] Fingerbooones![Players join in]Kyle (as Fibblewix): It’s like I had some kind of bardic inspiration from you guys to be able to solo like that!Goodrich: Oh!Kyle (as Fibblewix): I’ve never been able to play like that in my life!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Listen-Ali (as Yashee): You’re welcome!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.

Uh, I’m gonna go show my mom!Kyle: And he grabs his lute and he’s like-Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Slowly pulling away from the mic] Thank you! Thank you very much!Kyle: And he runs out- just runs out of the tavern-[Players saying goodbye]Goodrich: I turn to guys and I’m like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Man, that little joker plays better than I do, I don’t know what he’s talking about.[All chuckle]Kyle: You turn around after Fingerbones has left out of the tavern, you’ve noticed by this point in time, there’s actually some people that were like, tapping their feet along- you actually heard some of the tavern members say “hey!” at the end-[Players are excitedly surprised]Kyle: So, some of the people were getting into it and you turn and you see Big Shot sitting at a table with a full bottle of booze that’s already half down-[Players laugh]Goodrich: Aw, jeez.Kyle: They’re sitting at the table but their heads down on it- all the sudden somebody comes through the door- they kick open the door and it’s this tall human, he’s bald, he’s wearing explorers' clothes but  there’s an insignia of the Bureau of Intelligence on his shoulder. And he takes a moment and he’s looking around and he just says-Kyle (as John): Evening everyone, my name is John Laramy I'm heading the expedition down to the meteorite I'm just looking for-Goodrich: Bards. He's looking for bards.[Players laugh]Spurrier: And so, the acronym on that is BOI?[Everyone laughs harder]Kyle: Yes- yes, it’s BOI.Goodrich: He’s our BOI!Spurrier: You work at BOI!?Kyle: So yeah, he’s got the insignia of the Bureau of Intelligence on his shoulder and just says-Kyle (as John): Good evening everyone, my name is John Laramy with the Bureau of Intelligence, I'm here to take an expedition out to discover a little bit about the meteor. I’m looking for Alphonse Correa, Trish Shareen, and Erin Copeland. Uh, does anybody know where they are?Kyle: And you see two people stand up, there’s this really tiny kind of half-elf that stands up and he raises his hand and is like-Kyle (as Whimpy): Yeah, I’m Alphonse, you can call my Whimpy.Kyle: And then another, bigger lady stands up- about the size of Yashee, and she’s got this like braided hair back in a bun and she’s like-Kyle (as Boom Queen): [With more of a souther drawl] Yeah, I’m Trish, the names Boom Queen. What’d you need with us?Kyle: And Uh, John kind of looks around and goes-Kyle (as John): So, what about- what about Erin? Erin Copeland? I was told I'd probably find her at the bar.Kyle: And the bartender Dewey looks up and he’s like-Kyle (as Dewey): Yeah if you’re ever looking for Erin good luck dragging her out of the bottom of a bottle.Kyle: And you see Big Shot grab the bottle that she’s drinking out of and throws it at Dewey, breaking against the wall behind him, and gets up and slugs out of the back.[Goodrich and Spurrier both surprised, “oh.”]Goodrich: I was about to say, if he’s looking for Erin Copeland he needs to check the mid-twentieth century.[Players chuckle then turn into laughter]Kyle: Anyway! So uh- [chuckles] “for those who know.”Goodrich: Right?Kyle: So, John says-Kyle (as John): Okay well, regardless we’re meeting in the morning south of town, we’re heading out towards the Glow Fields 9 a.m. sharp. Be there, we need you.Kyle: And you hear some people mutter and curse under their breath and what not, and he leaves just as quick as he came in. You see Dewey come out from behind the bar, and he’s actually in this weird floating like, bowl and it’s what he uses to move around the bar; he doesn’t have any legs.Goodrich: [Surprised] Oh!Spurrier: [Impressed] Ooh!Kyle: And he kind of comes around the bar and uses the bar to scoot himself along. There's really no manner to show why this thing is floating but it is, and he kind of floats over to you guys and-Kyle (as Dewey): Well-Goodrich (whispering): KrangKyle (as Dewey): You did exactly- [breaks character and laughs]Kyle: He comes over and he’s like-Kyle (as Dewey): Well, you were able to help out Fibblewix McFlibbs um, you called him what?Spurrier (as Randy): Fingerbones.Kyle (as Dewey): Fingerbones, I think that’s funnier actually. So, like I said, you can have the room upstairs- it's only one room.Kyle: He pulls out the piece of paper, signs it, hands it back to you. Kyle (as Dewey): Get this to your instructor, I appreciate helping him out, maybe he’ll be a little bit of a better bard and I liked what ya’ll were saying about going and facing those bureaucrats, I think a couple of the people were too. So, as long as you’re not in cahoots or associated, you might be alright for a little while. So- but enjoy the room for the night, breakfast is gonna be at eight- you know, It's included-[Players laugh]Spurrier: Continental!Kyle (as Dewey): Come on down- I mean we are on a continent so-[Players laugh, overlapping conversation with laughter]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Roger that!Kyle (as Dewey): Here’s the key-Kyle: And he holds it out.Ali: Oh! I’ll take the key!Kyle: Yashee, you take the key?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, I got a key!Kyle: And he says-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, we were changing keys earlier![All laugh]Kyle: And he says-Kyle (as Dewey): Ya’ll get some sleep, I know it’s late and you’ve probably traveled a long way to get here. The desert can be a little uh, a little rough. We've actually sent out some caravans with glass wear and they never made to Sundance apparently from what they hear. Lost somewhere along the way. Anyway, like I've said I got the bar to close up so.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright, bye!Ali (as Yashee): Nighty, night!Goodrich: [Singing] closing time.. [humming]Kyle: [Softly singing] You don’t have to go home.Ali: [Singing] I guess we can stay here.[All laugh]Kyle: You can stay here, that’s right!Spurrier: Phew!Kyle: So, you guys go up to your room, bed down for the night. It's basically been one whole day you’ve been stuck in a carriage this is your first time to be able to like, stretch out a little bit. You know, change your clothes-Goodrich: Change the potpourri out-Kyle: Get into some- yeah, you change the potpourri out. You can get into some actual sleepwear, and as you’re changing- you're in your respective corners trying to give yourself space but, Yashee and Raz’ul- you can’t help but notice when Randy’s changing- he removes his like, top gear and removes his undershirt, and in the middle of his back is a giant tattoo.Goodrich: Awesome!Kyle: And you know, you can’t help but be drawn in and you notice that it’s a circle of runes. There's a very big circle in the center of the tattoo and a rune inside of it, and some lines that shape outwards and you know, kind of squiggly as well. But there’s something odd about this tattoo, you notice that there’s a…it looks like a crack and uh-Goodrich: Like his butt crack?Kyle: It kind of glows red- [chuckles] Yeah-[All laugh]Kyle: There’s a crack in his back and it-Spurrier: It goes way down! Goodrich: Oh boy!Kyle: No, but you notice- you notice this crack and it’s a very small sliver on the right side of the tattoo. It looks like it’s blood red but upon further inspection you notice that it’s just emanating a red-ish hue and it’s not part of the tattoo design.Ali (as Yashee): Dude, Randy, sweet ink!Kyle: You don’t know what they’re talking about.Spurrier: Okay, I was gonna say, this is news to me!Kyle: Yup.Spurrier: Okay uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Uh..what?Ali (as Yashee): Oh your like, colossal tattoo on your back.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah dude.Spurrier: I turn around and try to look over my shoulder-Goodrich: Do the classic like, [grunting frantically]Kyle: What does mine say!? What does MINE say!?[All laugh]Kyle:But yeah-Spurrier (as Randy): I…What it this!?Goodrich: I describe it to Randy as you just did.Ali: Are there mirrors in this land?[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Do mirrors exist here?Spurrier (as Randy): [Panicked] Get it off! Get it off!Goodrich: Get it off, get it off! [Laughs]Kyle: Yeah, there’s a mirror.Ali: Oh!Goodrich: We direct him to the mirror.Spurrier: All right, well I guess- should we all investigate this cause I have no idea what this is on my back.[Multiple dice rolling]Spurrier: Because Randy can’t see his back, he gets a three plus one.[Players laugh]Kyle: Sweet.Ali: Thirteen.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Seventeen plus one for the jack of all trades.Kyle: Yashee and Randy you’re not really able to gather anything, I mean obviously you see a sick back tattoo but Raz’ul, you actually noticed some of the runes in this tattoo- they reference sealing something away or blocking off like, energy. Goodrich: Gotcha, and these runes are similar to the ones that are on Usumptin or?Kyle: No, they don’t look like anything on Usumptin, they look more like- a couple of the runes you recognize are more like druidic runes that you’ve seen before.Goodrich: Okay, I recognize them and understand they stand for like, sealing something away.Kyle: Yeah exactly, the rest of it you can’t quite make out but you know that that’s the purpose-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: It’s serving-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Could it be something inside your tummy, Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, well I mean-Kyle: That you do not yet know. But uh, I think we’ll call it there.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Okay.[Light, wistful music plays softly]-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter5/16/19"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-13-water-we-waiting-for,Ep. 13 – Water We Waiting For,"Ep. 13 – Water We Waiting For[Fur Elise by Beethoven plays on piano, speeds up then stops]Ali: We wrote that!Goodrich: Yeah! [Laughs] Can we just play them that?Spurrier: That’s called Fur Gibbildy-fibble-dibble Fingerbones[All laugh][Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed! Let's recap last episode real quick. So, last time we started with the bards learning about writing songs in a minor key, and that was before they were dropped off in the middle of Basom to find some lodging. So, you were dropped off at the center of town at the oasis and there you met and old dwarf named Dogum; who told you a little bit about the meteor impact which caused a cave-in at the mines. During this time, you also- well uh, Raz’ul you specifically-Goodrich: [Softly] Yeah..Kyle: You decided to try and get chummy with some of the kids.Goodrich: I just wanted to have a chaotic good time, Kyle![Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah, yeah no, for sure! But unfortunately, your magics kind of scared them away more than anything. But, after talking with Dogum a little bit he directed you towards The No Named Horse for lodging and it was on the way there that you ran into the town drunk, Big Shot. So, Big Shot convinced you three that Yashee owed her a drink because she was knocked over, so the four of you made your way to the tavern where you caught the tail end of a town meeting. And they were talking about some things regarding, you know, if the town was going to be able to make it through and about re-opening the mine. Kind of to reflect the stuff you heard from Dogum.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So, you earned your stay at the tavern that night by helping out a local musician named Fibblewix McFlibbs-Spurrier: Fingerbones!Kyle: Yeah, who’s now going by Fingerbones. Uh, so you helped him improve his song writing. Before you actually went to your room you were introduced to a trio of sorts. John Leremy who is the gentleman from the Bureau of Investigation or-Players: BOIII!Kyle: He was looking for a few people, specifically two of them stood up out of the three he was looking for and that’s Trish “Boom Queen” Shareen and Alphonse “Whimpy” Correa. All of whom are to be part of the expedition going to check out the impact site. That pretty much summed up more or less of your night and as you readied for bed, Yashee and Raz’ul you got a glimpse of a sick back tat on Randy, which was news to our littlest guy and that’s where we left off so let’s pick up right there. Goodrich: I imagine the whole time Randy’s running around in circles like- [panicked yelling] I can’t see!Ali: Pretty much.Spurrier: Like a dog chasing my tail, great.Goodrich: You had said that this tattoo is pretty much a heart with Joby in the middle of it?Kyle: No![All laugh]Kyle: [Laughing] No, it’s not.Ali: I dunno, that’s what- that's what I see!Goodrich: That’s what I see, Kyle! I dunno what you’re talking about.Kyle: You think it reads that-Goodrich: Right-Kyle: Maybe- maybe it does to you in your druid speak, I dunno.Goodrich: Maybe.Spurrier: So..what is it? [Laughs] I’m running in circles, I'm tired.Goodrich: Alright, so I grab you by the shoulders and I slap you and I say-Spurrier: Ah!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Snap out of it, Randy! Oh, god!Goodrich: And then I just tell him, I guess. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You know, back in my day when I was just a wee druid and I was learning all my druid alphabet and runes and what not, this was actually something we came across when you had something sealed up inside you. Sooo, you got something sealed up inside of you- [coughs] Eddie [coughs] maybe it’s being held in- [coughs twice] Eddie.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, what you got? What you got in there?Spurrier (as Randy): We talked about it.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): It was never there before, and Eddie’s been there and now there’s suddenly this.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Is Eddie trying to es-cap-ay? Maybe?Spurrier (as Randy): Well, I mean, is there anything on there that looks like he might be trying to es-cap-ay?Goodrich (as Randy): Alright, turn around, turn around.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhhhhhh, yes. It’s glowing.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh! Okay.Ali (as Yashee): It’s like- like a crack.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, do we wanna call Splash?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes! Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Get out our Ira-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Good call-Spurrier (as Randy): On our Ira Glasses.Goodrich: I get it out- [makes beep and boop noises] [whispers] Splash.Kyle (as Symbol): Hey, what’s up?[Players cheer]Goodrich: He responded to Splash!Spurrier: He responded to Splash! Aw.Ali: We broke him.Spurrier: The deed is done.[Silence]Goodrich: [Attempting not to laugh] So anywho there’s this problem with Randy- [laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, Hey prof-Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m gonna hand it over to Randy real quick and he can tell you what’s going on. Here you go, here’s Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Hey, Splash.Kyle (as Symbol): Hey Randy, what’s wrong this time?Spurrier (as Randy): Um, so I took off my shirt-Kyle (Symbol): Mkay..[Ali chuckles]Spurrier (as Randy): And I’m taking off my clothes, and there’s apparently a giant tattoo on my back that might have glyphs of sealing? And something might be trying to escape from inside me?Kyle (as Symbol): Oh-Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe Eddie? Can you help?Kyle (as Symbol): Um, maybe.Spurrier (as Randy): That’s reassuring as always.Kyle (as Symbol): I don’t know, I’d have to see it. So, um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You wanna swing by, maybe?Kyle (as Symbol): I’ll have to see you tomorrow, where- [as Luey Hewis] I’m coming, just a second! [Normal] I’ll have to see you tomorrow.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You in the middle of something?Kyle (as Symbol): [as Louie Hewis] Yeah, just a moment, John, yeah!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think he’s playing bridge with some of his-[Players agree softly]Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, no, I'll see you tomorrow.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’dya doin’? If you don’t mind me asking.Kyle: You don’t hear anything, there’s no response.[Players chuckle]Spurrier: Byee!Goodrich: Yeah, jeez.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright great, ummm-Goodrich: We have that red hand clutching a cracked pearl on a field of onyx pendent?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Could we bust that out and kind of hold it up to the crack-Kyle: Go ahead-Goodrich: Could you just kinda paint that picture again? Of like, what his back looks like?Kyle: Okay so, the tattoo on his back looks like three concentric circles, there’s two smaller ones at the very center uh, and from the second circle you see three wavy lines coming off in like a- they come off at three different points.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: And then in-between those wavy lines there are dashes that are just like floating in between the second circle and the third circle. On the inside of the third circle are where you see all the runes and glyphs-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: That just line that.Goodrich: Gotcha.Kyle: In the top right line, the line that kind of just floats, that’s where you can see the crack forming. Like, the energy red crack.Goodrich: Who’s got- oh that’s you, you have the pendant-Spurrier: I have the pendant, yeah.Goodrich: So, can I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, can you bust that pendant out? I just wanna try something real quick.Spurrier (as Randy): [Surprised] Oh! Uh, yeah okay, here.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ah- [grunts] alright.Goodrich: And I hold it up to the glowing part real quick, kind of, seeing if there’s any sort of reaction.Kyle: There is no reaction.Goodrich: Alright, I hand it back to you.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, thanks.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier: Does someone wanna touch it? Touch the red part? See what happens? Maybe touch it with like a stick or something?Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Oh, this could be a good time for me to take out some of those fingers, actually.[Players and Kyle agreeing]Ali: I’ll poke it with Rhiannon’s finger.Spurrier: There you go.Ali: I’ve got a bag with both of them, so let me just pick the longer one. Okay, I'm gonna just poke it right in there.Kyle: Okay, so you poke it into there and uh-Spurrier: [Shutters]Kyle: The fingernail kind of like- the fingernail on it kind of curls a little bit as it touches it-Ali: Ugh..Goodrich: Put it in further!Ali: Does it seem like I could put the finger in?Kyle: No.Spurrier: Do I feel anything?Kyle: No.Ali: I wasn’t gonna go for it, I was gonna ask first.Spurrier: It feels fine, you can try again.[All laugh]Goodrich: I wanna try, I wanna try!Ali: Well, couple more times- but it’s doing the same thing every time it’s just kinda-Spurrier: Okay, does it hit a barrier? Or like, can it continue?Kyle: It feels like it’s hitting a barrier.Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: Randy, you don’t feel any of this poking or prodding. Like, anytime you hit it on the crack you’re not feeling anything.Spurrier: [Curiously] Huh.Kyle: Like, you don’t feel any kind of sensation at all.Goodrich: I just wanna stick my finger in there now, just so I can feel what it feels like.Kyle: Feels like your touching one of those like, electric balls where you get the slight sensation of electricity on your fingers.Goodrich: Oh, okay!Kyle: It feels like that and it's like, rock hard.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You work out?[Players chuckle]Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, a bit.Kyle: Getting' swol.Goodrich: [chuckles] yeah.Spurrier: Randy’s jacked.Goodrich: Yeah! Uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, not much I can do for ya.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah um, well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I dunno, man!Spurrier (as Randy): I guess we should- I don’t have any means of doing anything about this?Goodrich: I do you have- I do have a book- I'm digging way back, stuff we picked up.Kyle: Yeah?Goodrich: I do have a book called The Anatomy of Humanoids, can I rifle through that real quick and see if-Kyle: You rifle through it and just imagine it more of like a basic biology book about like, oh yeah this is like how tall most halflings are, or how tall most humans are. It's pretty general knowledge but uh-Goodrich: There’s not like uh, medical section of it or- “what to do if your little Randy has a-”Kyle: No-Goodrich: “a glowing infection.” [Laughs]Kyle: It’s not a magical book.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: And since you know these are like, magical runes and symbols, this book would not serve as well.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, do you guys have any sort of like- not shield but anything to sort of like, cover it up so we can sleep and not get it on the bed?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, cause we didn’t-[Kyle burst out laughing]Goodrich: Would we have to pay extra if-Spurrier: Yeah-Goodrich: If we screw their bed up-Spurrier: Just kind of mask it and sleep it off and since Splash didn’t seem super concerned.Goodrich: Well I do have a needle that never bends, could I just-[Players laugh]Spurrier: Just sew it up?[Players laugh]Ali: Let’s not do that again.Goodrich: Let’s not, who knows what the heck will happen here. Poor little Randy just explodes. Uh, well I guess the only thing left to do is do a good old-fashioned arcana check, Kyle, is that cool?Kyle: Yeah, if you got the skills to pay those bills, roll it up.Goodrich: Ali, do you wanna roll?Spurrier: You said there was a mirror in here? Right?Kyle: Yup, I already established there was.Goodrich: Sweet.[Multiple dice rolling]Ali: I got an eighteen.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Fifteen plus one.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: And I got a nineteen plus one.Kyle: Sweet.Spurrier: Niice!Kyle: Okay so, you all look this over and Yashee you notice there’s some very tribal kind of markings that represent this. Of course, Raz’ul, you noticed all the druidic markings as well. Randy, as you’re looking at it you notice there’s a lot of arcanic runes and you all come to the conclusion that there’s a lot of different magics that were put into this glyph.Spurrier: Oh.Goodrich: Where have you been, son!?Spurrier: [Stammers] That’s a fantastic question!Goodrich: Jeez, like a suitcase over there with all the travel stickers all over it![All laugh]Kyle: Magical travel stickers.Spurrier: Well-traveled Randy.Kyle: But yeah, you all come to the conclusion that this was done by a person who knows their way around-Goodrich: A back.[Players laugh]Kyle: Uh, yes, they know it like-Spurrier: All the way around-Kyle: The back of Randy’s back.[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I mean if it’s not causing you any discomfort uh-Spurrier (as Randy): No, uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s just talk to Splash about it in the morning.Spurrier (as Randy): I guess I’ll sleep on my stomach, or use a sheet so-Goodrich: Well, what’s the bed situation here?Kyle: It’s one big bed that you can all fit in.Goodrich: Awww! Okay!Spurrier: Hurray!Goodrich: Ali, does Yashee kind of pull us in like two little teddy bears? Like, mm..Ali: Yeah, I plant one on top of your heads.Goodrich: [Laughing] Awww!Ali (as Yashee): Night, guys.Kyle: I imagine Yashee comes in like Spike on The Land Before Time and falls into the bed.[Players chuckle]Kyle: Alright, so you all get ready for bed and uh, you’re all crawling in and you cozy up, you get in tight and you start drifting off. And as you drift off, you each dream. Oh boy, do you dream.Spurrier: Ooh.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Kyle: Yashee, as you sleep you have a couple different dreams, probably about spoons, food or banging out some sweet beats.Ali: Mhm.Kyle: But those tend to fade away and uh, suddenly you’re surrounded by darkness. It's very, very reminiscent of the void from recent-Goodrich: We just can’t get away! [Laughing] Oh my god..Kyle: But all the sudden there’s a flash of blinding light from a bolt of lightning, and a loud deafening clap of thunder. Your vison slowly comes to you and you notice you’re standing in torrential downpour just outside of a medium sized tent. The tent flap opens up and your dad stands there gesturing for you to come in. He is saying something but all you can hear is the sound of the storm around you. You enter the tent and your dad continues to speak but you can’t hear his words. He looks like a nervous wreck and is constantly rubbing his head or running his hands through his hair in distress. He gestures to a partition section of the tent and nods in approval while opening the curtain. You step towards the opening and inside you see your mom lying on a pile of pillow. A bucket of steaming water and a pile of wash cloths and towels are next to her. She begins to scream in immense pain with tears running down her cheeks. While you aren’t able to hear the scream, you can feel it. It shakes you to your core. You are shaken so violently you are woken up in a cold sweat, your heart pounding, and you are on the verge of going into a rage.Kyle: So, Raz’ul!Goodrich: Aw, jeez! [laughs]Spurrier: Oh wow, okay!Kyle: You drift to sleep easily and start having your normal dream of crafting items that are on par with Usumptin’s quality, and you’re striking your hammer at a steady rhythm. And as you continue, the sound of your hammering turns into the sound of knocking on a door. Suddenly, you’re standing in front of a door in what you recognize is a common living quarters underneath Mt. Tain. You hear coughing coming from inside the house and through the coughing you hear- [coughing] “come in.” You enter the into the small dwelling and see a very sickly-looking dwarven woman lying on a cot near a small fireplace. She turns to face you and her face is stricken with shock. “A- am I hallucinating? Is this the end? Are you real? Please, if you are, take care of-” but you interrupt the woman with a comforting [shushes]. You reach out and caress her forehead, and as you do you hear the coo of a baby coming from the next room. This coo wakes you up, and you have a deep sense of longing, but for what? You do not know.Kyle: Randy! It’s a rough night of sleep for ol’ Randy but only because Eddie waits until you are on the verge of sleep to say something. He finally ceases his torture and as you are drifting off, you hear him humming a familiar melody, but you can’t place where you know it from. You drift off with this tune in your ear and as you sleep, you begin to dream. You take a look around and recognize that you’re deep inside the Mons Organum, the large mountainous organ that your family lived near when you were young. There's a sense of failure and a sense of loss of hope that washes over you as you place a cloth wrapped object onto a pedestal. There’s a glow emanating from underneath the cloth and as you turn to leave the chamber you turn back one more time before leaving. As you look over your shoulder you can see the glowing begin to subside and fade completely. You're left with a sense of sadness you can’t explain which sticks with you as you awaken the next morning.Kyle: So, you all wake up- Yashee, you’re on the verge of rage. Raz’ul, you’re longing for something you can’t even grasp, and Randy you are just filled with a feeling of remorse.Goodrich: [Stretching] Alright, who’s ready to write a song! No, I'm just- I'm just kidding.[Players chuckle]Kyle: If you wanna roll the chord dice-Goodrich: No, no, no-Kyle: You can totally- if you wanna sing about your dreams-Goodrich: Aw jeez.Kyle: [Singing] Sing your dreams!Goodrich: No.Kyle: No?Goodrich: No.Kyle: Okay! Randy and Raz’ul you can both see that Yashee is just like, pumped and looks like she’s probably about to break something.Ali: Just like, staring at the wall like shaking a little bit-Goodrich: I just go and give you a big hug and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s okay, did you have a bad dream? Does this always happen when you have a bad dream?Ali (as Yashee): [Distressed] I don’t know- I don’t know what this dream was about. This just like- oh my gosh, I can’t even control myself!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Randy, Randy! Get over here, give her a hug-Spurrier: Yeah, I sort of didn’t even really notice it- so yeah, I sort of snap out of it.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh! Uh, okay! Yeah!Spurrier: And I hop on over.Ali: I start breathing- [inhales and exhales slowly]Spurrier (as Randy): In and out.Ali (as Yashee): [Softly] I’m fine..Kyle: Raz’ul got a special potpourri for it I'm sure.Goodrich: I make up that stress away potpourri we had earlier that uh-Kyle: Right on-Goodrich: And I say- and I realize that the longing that I had was not a hug from Yashee, as warm and massive as it was, I guess-[Ali chuckles]Spurrier: My sadness is still there so-Spurrier (as Randy): Raz’ul, can I get a hit of that?[Kyle laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): I’m not feeling so great myself.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah dude, just breathe the air, Randy.Goodrich: Or do you just take it from me like- [exhales loudly]Spurrier: Just like- [sniffles loudly multiple times]Kyle: Alright, so you all comfort each other and get calmed down.Goodrich: Is Yashee all better?Kyle: Yashee, are you feeling better?Ali: I think I'm feeling better.Kyle: Yeah, I'd say you-Ali: Calm, under control-Kyle: I’d say with the stress away potpourri- you know, that’d probably be a good rage bringer downer.Goodrich: I’m gonna go ahead and write that down.Kyle: Yeah! You know, who knows. Maybe if it gets out of hand sometimes it’ll be your quick fix.Spurrier: Keep that stocked up, yeah.Goodrich: I always keep it stocked. I mean, I guess it should be said that while we’re walking around doing our things I'm collecting bits and pieces of things for potpourri. I'd think I spent enough time in the woods after I left the mountain to know, “ooh! That's some good sage right there! Oh yeah, that’s some good lavender that I can use!” blah, blah, blah.Kyle: Yeah, like urban forager or something.Goodrich: Yeah! Uh, well-Spurrier: Uh, is my back still glowing and cracking and-Goodrich: Here, take off your nightgown-Spurrier: Okay-Goodrich: And we’ll look at it.Spurrier: I unbutton my silk..yeah.[Players laugh]Kyle: You unbutton those fine pj silks.Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: Uh, Raz’ul and Yashee you check out the tattoo and it looks the same as the night before.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you feel any different?Spurrier (as Randy): Not really.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Did you have any goofy visions or anything? I just had a wacky dream but it was-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Stock standard-Spurrier (as Randy): Right-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Weirdness.Spurrier (as Randy): Your potpourri helps even it all out.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, good.Spurrier (as Randy): Do we call Splash again?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s call Splash again-Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe actually make him do his job.[Players stifle a laugh]Kyle: You try to call Splash but there’s no answer.[Players “aw”]Spurrier (as Randy): Dinga-linga-ling. Great.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe he could have called the school nurse or something.[All laugh]Kyle: All the way back at the school? Let’s go back!Goodrich: Let’s go back, no time for this!Kyle: We’ll come back to Basom once we’re ready again.[All chuckle]Goodrich: Yeah- no, no it took us too long to get here! I guess we should head downstairs?Spurrier: Heck yeah, I guess.[All agreeing]Kyle: So, you head on downstairs after getting dressed and all proper for the day. As you’re walking downstairs you notice that Deweys going around and he’s uh, in his little floaty cart and you know, making sure all the breakfast things are laid out properly. You see he’s laying out like, chalk boards that have the three-piece menu on there and everything. Uh, he’s got some nice cutlery set out for the breakfast crowd and everything. Um, and as he’s doing this he looks up and he sees you and he’s just like-Kyle (as Dewey): Good mornin’[Players green him tiredly]Kyle (as Dewey): You sleep well?[All players “eh” after each other]Ali (as Yashee): It was interesting.[Spurrier and Goodrich chuckle]Kyle (as Dewey): Well, if you’re hungry I got the menus on the table you can just let me know what you want. Have at it!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool, thanks Dewey.Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s do it.Kyle: There’s a menu in front of you, there’s a menu in front of you- nope, don’t pass him that one, pass him this one.Goodrich: [Softly] Okay.Kyle: And there’s a menu in front of you.Goodrich: Sweet!Kyle: Dewey comes up and he floats in his thing, and he’s like-Kyle (as Dewey): So, you had a chance to look over the menu?Ali (as Yashee): Sure, I'll take it!Goodrich: I hand the menu back [laughs]Kyle (as Dewey): Okay, one, two, three.Spurrier: Uh, Kyle? Does this menu have pictures on it?Goodrich: Oh no!Kyle: No.Spurrier: [Disappointed] Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): I’ll take..Spurrier: I point right about there-Kyle (as Dewey): Okay, the number three. You got it little boy!Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you!Kyle (as Dewey): I like your gusto!Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, appreciate it.Goodrich: And I'll say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, and I'll take the number three too.Kyle (as Dewey): Number three as well? Oh, okay well I'll get all- um- Yashee it was?Ali (as Yashee): Yes!Kyle (as Dewey): The first item might take a little while, the trout and egg, that’s from the oasis.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, alright.Kyle (as Dewey): Dogum hasn’t brought by the uh, his catch yet. So, I don’t have the trout yet actually.Kyle: And he rubs it off of the chalk board.Ali (as Yashee): Alright, well if you don’t end up having the trout that’s fine, we got stuff to do today.Kyle (as Dewey): Excellent, well give me a little bit and I'll have your food out.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Thanks, Dewey!Kyle: He, you know, floats in his little cart on back to the back and you hear the kitchen start to fire up and um, but-Goodrich: I turn to Randy and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I didn’t know you were one for stuff that’s hot and spicy.Goodrich: Cause number three- I guess it should be said that number three was the Basom Breakfast Bun. Which is a Basom baked bun, completed with sausage, bacon and sun blister peppers. And it says, caution, on it which I assumed you-Ali: Mhm!Goodrich: I lean over and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah! Going for that sun blister pepper. I never had them but I kind of wanted to-Spurrier (as Randy): [Nervously] Yeah! I uh, it’s how I got these hairy feet! Puts the- puts the-[All burst out laughing]Goodrich: Puts the hair on your feet!?Spurrier: Puts the crust on them, oh boy- alright! Randy does a little inner constitution check.[All chuckle]Goodrich: Phew.Spurrier: Oh man..Kyle: See yeah, dish one was trout and eggs which is just pan-fried trout with some, you know, two eggs and a fruit bowl. Uh, there’s the Basom omelet which has, eggs, ground sandatee, cheese, grain peppers, onions and chives.Ali: Mhm!Kyle: Super delicious.Goodrich: I imagine the sounds going on is that sound that goes on when never you make stuff in Zelda like- [imitates clunking sounds]Kyle: Yup! Yup, absolutely!Ali: Ba-da-dum!Kyle: Don’t forget to pat your tummy after you eat it. As Dewey is getting your food taken care of and you know, a few people mill in. As you’re waiting, you actually start to hear a town crier running through the streets he’s ringing a bell and he’s telling everyone like- [bell dinging] emergency meeting at the oasis! Emergency meeting at the oasis! And he kind of Doppler effects out as he’s passing.Goodrich: [Chuckling] He must have been going by really fast.Kyle: Yeah its- you know, he sounds pretty distressed. But, it’s at this point that your food actually gets put in front of you.Goodrich: Yeah, I'm definitely eating so uh..yeah!Ali: Yes, yes absolutely.Spurrier: We need to do a constitution check for our uh..Kyle: [Amused] Yes, absolutely-Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: Very insightful of you, you didn’t even have to roll for that one. Yeah, everybody please give me a constitution check.[Multiple dice rolling]Kyle: Or a save, you can make it a save so...Ali: Mines a twenty-two in that case.Kyle: Twenty-two.Spurrier: Mines a two plus one!Goodrich: Man, I got eighteen plus one!Kyle: Oh, dude, Raz’ul and Yashee you’re good to go. I mean it’s hot, don’t get me wrong-Goodrich: But it’s a good hot! It’s a good heat!Kyle: Yeah, ya’ll are like laughing about it.Goodrich: I’m like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yo, Yashee this is so good, right!?Ali (as Yashee): Ahhh, my stomach’s burning but it burns so good!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Kyle: Randy, you don’t know what the hell you’ve put on your tongue but you’re doing the kind of thing like, Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber like, squeezing out condiments like- ahh![Players laugh]Kyle: Dewey kind of comes up and he puts down a glass of milk and he’s just like-Kyle (as Dewey): Drink that up-Spurrier: I stick my entire face in it![All laugh]Spurrier: Just- [makes a frantic gurgling noise]Kyle: [Chuckling] So you stick your face in and pull it out and it’s just like, you know, white milk face dripping down and your tongue might be swollen up for just a little bit.Spurrier (as Randy): [Mumbling as if his tongue was swollen] You guyss, I-[Players laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Oww..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You alright?Spurrier (as Randy): Isth good.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You look like that dude in Aliens with the white stuff on your face.[All laugh]Kyle: Dewey says-Kyle (as Dewey): Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it, it’s one of our favorite dishes around here but uh, please come back any time!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah man, grub is delicious! Thanks.Spurrier (as Randy): Thankth Dewey.Ali: Hey um, just before they take the plates away, I'm gonna grab one of the spoons from the table that I was using and just kind of tap it against the table on the side a little bit, like the leg of the table.Kyle: Okay, go ahead and give me a performance check.[Dice rolling]Spurrier: Playing them spoons.Ali: Alright, I got a twenty-three.Kyle: Okay, so how do you test this spoon?Ali: At first, I'm just gonna kinda tap it on the table leg. Like- [metal tapping on surface] Okay, and then I bring it back up and uh, give it a tap on the glass. [Metal tapping on glass, sounds impressed] I take out another spoon from my pocket and kind of lay this one in there, and put that one back.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Uhhh..Kyle: Roll me a slight of hand.Ali: [Rolls dice] Uh, fifteenKyle: Cool so, yeah you slide the spoon after you’re testing it- you notice there’s a sturdiness behind it and it really like, cracks. There's like a crack sound to it that really like, makes it very percussive.Goodrich: Say crack again.Kyle: Crack, crack, crack![Goodrich laughs]Kyle: Crack!Goodrich: I imagine, Raz’ul, Randy-Kyle: Your passive perception would not notice this.Goodrich: I would even say, when she’s like banging it we’re just kind of like, “it’s Yashee, she’s drumming on stuff-”Spurrier: She’s feeling the spoons out, yeah.Kyle: You notice that she’s testing the spoon, and then..there’s no spoon.Goodrich: Yeah, there is no spoon.[All laugh]Kyle: So, what do?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh yeah, let’s go check out over by the oasis, town crier zipped by here. I'm feeling pretty good, how about you Randy? How you feeling buddy?Spurrier (as Randy): [Continued like he has a swollen tongue] Aw man, I'm ready.[Players chuckle]Spurrier (as Randy): Leth do ith.Kyle: So, you step out into the streets and everything after having eaten. You notice that everyone's gathered towards the oasis. It took you probably about like ten, fifteen minutes to eat. Most of the people that were in the tavern actually like, left and they left their breakfast and stuff.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can- can we get up on your shoulders? Yashee? So that we can see.Goodrich: Because I imagine we can’t see what’s going on.Ali (as Yashee): Sure, come on up!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can you handle-Ali (as Yashee): Do you both wanna get up here or?Spurrier (as Randy): Well, I can ride on your shoulders.Goodrich: Oh, yes!Ali (as Yashee): Alright.Kyle: Be like, dog, cat, rat.Goodrich: Yes!Ali: I’ll crouch down and letcha climb on.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So yeah, I'm just gonna- that's gonna happen.[Players laugh]Spurrier: There is no rule for that.Kyle: That is definitely happening. So, you three towering bards walk up and uh, Randy you’re at the top so you can definitely see, and Yashee you can see over most people. You all can see fairly well now. But, you see that there’s a man, and it’s the same man that was kind of leading the town meeting last night. He's in front of the oasis and he’s talking to everyone and he’s kind of, you know, the crowds been murmuring and he like, holds up his hands. He says-Kyle (as Tony): [With slight Irish accent] I-I- I know, I don’t like it any more than you. I was raised here like many of you and if you think I'm not pissed about it then you don’t know me very well, which means you owe me a drink!Kyle: And he kind of winks at everyone in the crowd and everyone starts kind of laughing and everything. But you hear somebody from the crowd yell out-Kyle (as Crowd Person): [yelling] But Tony, what about your daughter Jenny? She could still be out there or at the bottom of that hole!Kyle: The people start to rabble a little bit and everything, and uh-Goodrich: Do we rabble?[All repeat “rabble” together]Kyle: And uh, he holds up his hands again and says-Kyle (as Tony): I don’t want to say I've given up, but I still have Edie, Mary and Jimmy. I spoke with Mr. Stone from the B.O.I. earlier and explained the situation. He said while they’re down there, doing whatever it is they’re doing with the meteor- he said he’d look for her. And you need to realize, we lost the mine and that’s one thing. But losing the oasis? There's no living here now, and I'm not gonna ask any of you, who are basically family, I'm not gonna ask you to stick around to try to find my daughter who may be dead. And I'm not gonna risk the rest of my family, either. [Sighs] That’s- that’s all I'm gonna say about that.Kyle: And he’s obviously stifling with emotion and everything. He kind of stops and shakes his head and he says-Kyle (as Tony): [Sighs] That’s all I've got, everyone get your affairs in order and get ready to move. Thank you.Goodrich: I look at you guys- and I don’t know how I would do that, I just-Spurrier: I’ll put my head down.Goodrich: Yeah put your head down, and I just say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh boiiiiii, that didn’t sound good.Ali: I’m just clapping for the speech. [Clapping]Kyle: You start clapping for the speech and everyone turns around and looks at you like-Ali: Uh oh.Goodrich: I knock you in the head like, stop it!Ali (as Yashee): Sorry, I thought it was very well said.Kyle: And they all kind of glare at you very, very like, upset. Just like, “what the hell is your problem?” and then they start to disperse. And at this time, you hear- you hear a kid say-Kyle (as Child): Mommy! That’s him! That’s the scary man!Goodrich: [In disbelief] Oh, my god![Players laugh]Kyle (as Child): That’s the scary man up there!Kyle: And you see a mom walk forward with these two kids, which you recognize to be the ones that you tried to perform for yesterday, and she’s staring up at you and she’s just like-Kyle (as Mother): [Angry] Where do you get off trying to scare children in towns you’ve never been in before?Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know what you’re talking about, lady.Kyle (as Mother): Are you calling my children liars!? Do you hear this people? These strangers in our town are calling my children liars!Kyle: And everyone starts to turn again and they’re all looking at you like, “do we have a problem?” somebody steps forward and is like-Kyle (as Townsperson): Is there- is there a problem here?Spurrier: And at this point, Randy does an acrobatics check off of the top of you, to land behind you and do a stealth check so I can be hidden-[All laugh]Spurrier: From all of this nonsense. So-Kyle: Go right ahead-Spurrier: Acrobatics, that is a..sixteen plus nine, twenty-five.Kyle: [Amused] Okay.[Ali giggling]Spurrier: And then my stealth check, that is a thirteen plus nine, twenty-two.Kyle: Okay, describe this to me please.[Goodrich laughs]Spurrier: So, I just lean down to you, Raz’ul and I say-Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, bye![All laugh]Spurrier: And I just roll backwards and spin and flip and kind of tuck myself into a little ball and land behind Yashee, and now I'm hidden.Goodrich: Okay, and I stand up on Yashee’s shoulders now that Randy's off of my shoulders.Kyle: Mkay.Goodrich: And I am going to cast minor illusion.Kyle: Mkay.Goodrich: And uh, so the thing with minor illusion is I can create an image that’s no bigger than a five-foot cube and Raz’ul only stands four-foot something.Kyle: Mkay.Goodrich: So, I'm going to create an illusion of me, and I'm gonna put it thirty-feet away from me but like, peeking out from the side of like, another building.Kyle: Okay, tucked away in an alleyway?Goodrich: Right so- so- So, to cast that I bring Usumptin down and I say uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Playing guitar, singing] It wasn’t Raz’ul, it wasn’t Raz’ul, it was a minor illusion. Mistaken for me.[All chuckle]Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: And I point towards him and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh no man, I think the guy you’re looking for is that guy over there.Goodrich: And I point to the illusion of myself that I made peeking out from behind the crowd. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He’s the shifty guy that’s over there! You should go check him out!Kyle: Okay. [Rolls dice] They all turn and are just like-Kyle (as Child): Y-yeah mom, that is him!Kyle: And they all turn and start walking towards the illusion.Goodrich: Okay, and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Guys, let’s book it. Now. We gotta get out of here. Let's go find that dude that was making that speech and see what’s up.Kyle: As you’re all conferring about this, you notice as the crowd is moving you can actually see like, the dude who was making the speech, he’s still up there by the oasis- which, you can see him, you can see Dogum who’s standing there talking with him. You see a few other people standing around and you notice Symbol who is dressed up as Luey Hewis hanging out with this group of people as well-Goodrich: Phew!Spurrier: Well, well, well! And Kyle, with his speech like talking about the oasis being over- does it look different? Or like, is it the same as it looked yesterday?Kyle: Uh, you can’t tell from where you’re at-Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: You might be able to tell once you’re a little bit closer.Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: Unfortunately, you missed some details because you were eating.Spurrier: Ah, right.Kyle: Such is time.[All chuckle]Kyle: But-Goodrich: Yeah, we all know how time works so great playing dungeons and dragons!Spurrier: Oh also, is my tongue normal again? Or am I still-Kyle: Yeah, yeah, the heat has subsided, so you’re good to go.Spurrier: Okay, sweet. [Makes noises]Goodrich: Yeah, let’s go over to Symbol, but I'm gonna stay on- on Yashee’s shoulders and just-Ali: Okay.Goodrich: Walking over there-Kyle: You’re not walking over there then.Goodrich: Well right, so I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee! Hoo!Goodrich: And I uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Like he’s marching] One, two, three, four and a- [continues on]Ali (as Yashee): Really, dude?[All chuckling]Kyle: He’s like trying to move your shoulders to the- like a marching beat.Ali: I just grab him and put him down and I'm like-Ali (as Yashee): Stop that.[Kyle laughs]Goodrich: But then I just keep walking like that- and a hup, two, three, four-Ali (as Yashee): Hey, we need to make sure that he stays undercover.Ali: Are we even supposed to know who Louie Hewis is?Kyle: You don’t know.Ali (as Yashee): Alright so-Kyle: You’re not sure-Ali (as Yashee): Let’s be cool guys.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool, be cool.Goodrich: Okay, well in that case I'm gonna walk up like this- [Starts snapping rhythmically]Ali: I’ll join him. [Starts snapping as well]Goodrich: [To the rhythm] Yashee, Yashee, crazy, Yashee- Turn down the juice Yashee.[All laugh]Kyle: You start snapping and walking up, Symbol looks over and he like waves at you, and he covers his mouth and kind of like, snickers a little bit. And he just kind of waves you over a little bit but keeps looking back towards the conversation. So, as you’re approaching the grow, you know Dogum recognizes you, he turns and see you and gives you a hearty wave and everything. And Tony kind of looks at you, the guy who was giving the speech, he’s twisting his face trying to remember where he’s seen you before but once you get a little bit closer you notice that John Leremy, the official from the Bureau of Investigation-Goodrich: BOIII!Kyle: Yeah, from the BOI, he’s standing there with uh-Goodrich: Can they please pronounce it Boiii-Kyle: Boiii-Ali: Boiii-Goodrich: Can we just go ahead and say that’s how they pronounce this bureau?Kyle: Yes-Goodrich: Whenever they say it, they just say-Goodrich & Spurrier: Boiii!Kyle: Yeah, it’ll be official from now on.Goodrich: Okay-Spurrier: Phew![Goodrich laughs]Kyle: But the other people- [laughs] But the other people that you notice- that you recognize are Trish “Boom Queen” Shareen, and Alphonse “Whimpy” Correa. They were at the bar last night and they’re just hanging around. Other than that, you notice an elven woman which a tattoo of a crescent moon that lines her right jawline. She's wearing a flowing purple and blue robe that kind of mimics the night sky, and you can see comets streaking across it every once in a while.[Players sound impressed]Kyle: There’s also a human woman with chestnut brown hair, she’s wearing a very woody garb and there’s a daisy that’s growing from a pile of dirt that sits on her shoulder. Next to her there’s a slouchy looking half-elf nearby, and he’s wearing a pack that looks like it might tip backwards if it not for the stack of books that he’s carrying in front of him acting as a counter weight. He’s wearing a pale, poufy armed garb that, you know, bureaucratic assistants wear. But he has square framed glasses that ride low on his nose, and next to him stands a bald dwarf with pitch black beard that has small gems that are worked into the braids that kind of peek out and this dwarf actually steps up as you’re approaching and he says-Kyle (as Connor): [Heavy and deep Irish accent] Whoa, whoa, whoa! Right there’s good, this is official bureaucratic business we’re discussing so I’ll have to ask you to back up out of earshot.Kyle: He pulls his pants up from his belt as he stands there and he eyes you three down, his gaze lingering for a moment on Raz’ul, and he nods his head at Raz’ul and he says-Kyle (as Connor): I uh, I know you from somewhere, you got one of those faces uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s what everyone says.Kyle (as Connor): Wait, wait, wait, wait..I know you. I know exactly who you are- oh man! I remember bouncing you out of the Hard Rock Café in Rocktee exactly twenty-eight years, two months and fourteen days ago! I remember your face looks like it does now! [Pauses] Yeah, just like that![Goodrich laughs]Kyle: He points and makes a face mocking you and laughing-Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No dude, that’s the dude back behind [trying not to laugh] the building-[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I keep tellin’ you folks, it’s this other guy! You keep getting me mixed up with him!Kyle: He’s laughing and slapping his knee and uh, then Symbol chimes in and he just goes-Kyle (as Symbol): Uh, Connor, Connor, those must be the bards that are meeting me here, you can let them on over.Kyle: Connor is just kind of, laughing and slapping his knees like-Kyle (as Connor): Ah, go on I guess if you’re here with him.Goodrich: And I-Spurrier: Cool!Kyle: He kind of wipes the tear from his eye and everything. You know, as you walk up you can actually start to hear John, he is talking to Tony and he’s telling Tony in a very reassuring manner, he’s saying-Kyle (as John): Look, this is something I can do for you. You know, I can do this as a person, I'm not bound by the BOI-[Ali giggles]Kyle (as John): To actually do everything else, but I can do this for you; and if I find anything in regards to your daughter I’ll bring back what I can. And if there’s any kind of clue as to what might have happened to the oasis- I can’t guarantee anything but, I'll go ahead and contact Sundance and let them know to uh, expect some refugees to show up and they’ll set up the uh- they'll set up the tents. We can at least be ready for your people, that’s about all I can do but I'm sorry for you and your town’s loss.Spurrier: And while we’re listening to this, I just want to roll a perception to see what’s up with the oasis.Kyle: Mkay.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] ten plus three.Kyle: Yeah, you take a peek over and you see the oasis and you can see that it looks like it’s dried up. Can't see the water front anymore. You can see where it’s like, damp, but it looks like the oasis has been drained.[Players sound shocked]Spurrier: And there were fish and stuff in it, right?Kyle: Yup.Spurrier: Are there fish now?Kyle: There are fish that are flopping around on the ground.Spurrier: Ah, good. So yeah, I turn to them and go-Spurrier (as Randy): Hey, guys! This is a little odd, check it out.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Surprised] Oh!Ali (as Yashee): [Surprised] Oh, man.Kyle: John kind of stops and he’s just like-Kyle (as John): So, you are the three bards that were at the tavern last night, correct? I feel like I recognize you.Spurrier (as Randy): We were jamming down with Fingerbones.Goodrich: And I do the same thing we always do-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup, Chaos Sauce, nice to meet you!Goodrich: Hand him our card and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We do parties, weddings uh, you know give us a call. Symbol, he’s kind of our manager.Kyle (as John): Okay..Goodrich: I’m trying to make it sound big time, not that we’re students and since Symbol can’t say anything like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Symbol, you remember Symbol? He’s a little washed up now but you know-[All laugh]Goodrich: He’s trying to get his hand in kinda, you know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sorry, we just saw the oasis, realized the severity of it, realized now is not the time. However, we might be able to help out a little bit.Kyle (as John): Well yes, I mean, that’s- yes, that’s uh, that’s what Luey Hewis was saying is that you were here more to document the going ons of this event. History is something important to preserve and the Bureau of Intelligence, or BOI, doesn’t handle that, it is important to be able to study that.Goodrich: Right.Kyle (as John): So, it has benefitted us to help save our history considering how much of it was lost many, many- nearly a millennia ago.Goodrich: Right.Kyle (as John): So, um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And how’s the BOI doing?Kyle (as John): The BOI is doing quite well.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as John): We’re having you know, some successes and some advancement but I'm not at liberty to discuss in full detail. What we do need to figure out is uh, real quick, Jaffiney, if you have a moment. Send word over to the capital and let them know to prepare the tents.Kyle: The elven woman with the moon tattoo nods and replies back-Kyle (as Japhnnie): [Softer tone] It’s already done, John, I’ve got it.Kyle: John turns to the woody woman and the assistant that’s in blue and says uh-Kyle (as John): Layla, Jermaine, go ahead and uh, why don’t you go ahead to the site? We’ll be there as soon as we can. Just go ahead and get prepared for whatever we may have to do.Kyle: Layla’s like-Kyle (as Layla): [Soft tone] Oh yeah of course, absolutely, not a problem John. Come on, Jermaine.Kyle: And uh, they begin to walk off towards the south. But John, you know, breathes in deeply and stretches and kind of turns back to you-Kyle (as John): Okay so, one issue that I've had is there’s a person in town- I want them on this expedition. Mainly because of their proficiency in mining and understanding cavernous areas, which I have a feeling we’re going to be getting into. Her name is Erin Copland, and I haven’t been able to pin her down and the citizens of this fine town of Basom-Kyle: As he looks over towards Whimpy and Boom Queen-Kyle (as John): They don’t seem to care to help find her for me.Kyle: You hear Boom Queen respond, she’s like-Kyle (as Boom Queen): I’m sure as sandatee shit Erin wouldn’t set her drink down to lift a finger for you, so quit wasting your time, John.Kyle: And uh, Johns just like-Kyle (as John): See? Perhaps, since you’re bards, you are more charismatic. Perhaps you could do some coaxing for me and uh, first off find Erin, and second off convince her to do this.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe we can ask uh, that Big Shot lady. She seemed to get pretty upset last night when uh, Erin’s name was mentioned. Maybe they were friends or something.Kyle (as John): That might be actually a good start. So, the quicker you can get her on our side the sooner we can get out to the site and see what’s actually going on. You can document your history, I'm sure get a good grade, or whatever it is they do over at Strumlotts.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as John): Um, and impress your teacher.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, alright.Spurrier: Do we see Big Shot around?Kyle: Give me a perception check.Goodrich: Alright![Multiple dice rolling]Spurrier: That is a sixteen plus three.Goodrich: Three plus five.Ali: Oh, mines a seven.[Players chuckle]Kyle: No, you look around and she is not in the immediate vicinity.Goodrich: [Sighs] Well, fiddlesticks. Um, can I turn to Whimpy and Boom Queen and just ask them-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, hey you guys maybe wanna help us do some diligence and uh, help us find Erin, maybe?Spurrier (as Randy): Or at least point us in the right direction. You don’t have to do anything.Kyle (as Whimpy): You’re trying to find Erin, I mean- [sighs]Kyle: Whimpy steps forward as he’s rubbing his neck and looks at you and he says-Kyle (as Whimpy): You three helped out Fibblewix McFlibbs, right?Spurrier (as Randy): His new stage name is Fingerbones.Kyle (as Whimpy) That’s much better.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right? Right?Kyle (as Whimpy): Fingerbones, it flows.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Awesome.Kyle (as Whimpy): More than likely you’ll find Erin either behind the bar passed out; the tavern we were at last night, or walk by any open alleyway and she might just stumble out into you trying to get a drink.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, and just to be sure we’re on the same page, so Erin is A.K.Aed as Big Shot around here, right?Kyle (as Whimpy): Ah, it’s kind of a town name for her.Goodrich: Aw.Kyle (as Whimpy): She seems to take to it very well unfortunately.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, well there you go.Ali (as Yashee): So, she does know Big Shot?[Players laugh]Kyle (as Whimpy): [Pauses ]..Yes, I would say very well.Ali (as Yashee): They know each other?Spurrier (as Randy): On the deepest level possible, Yashee.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeaaah.Spurrier (as Randy): Don’t you worry, Yashee.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeaah.Goodrich: So, I guess- Kyle, can we just go back inside the tavern and check behind the bar? Real quick?Kyle: Mkay, so you walk inside the tavern and Dewey’s you know, going around and he’s still serving up some breakfast and stuff like that. He says uh-Kyle (as Dewey): Ah, welcome back! Uh, give me a minute and I’ll give you a hand if you need it-Spurrier (as Randy): You haven’t seen anyone passed out, have you?Kyle (as Dewey): No, it’s- well, I mean there’s always one, right?Spurrier (as Randy): Well, yeah.Kyle (as Dewey): Haven’t seen her around though-Spurrier (as Randy): Oh.Kyle: (as Dewey): Um-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, we need to ask her if she knows this lady.Kyle (as Dewey): Who?[Goodrich laughs]Ali (as Yashee): Big Shot!Kyle (as Dewey): Oh!Ali (as Yashee): You know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Dewey): Well, take a look, maybe she crawled in under the bar behind there somewhere, I don’t know-Spurrier: I’m gonna go investigate behind the bar!Goodrich: Me too![Multiple dice rolling]Goodrich: Ali, do you wanna roll?Ali: I’m actually just gonna go and kinda reach over the bar and start filling up with like-Goodrich: Oh![All chuckle]Ali: Ale, something, just so you can hear the spout going.Kyle: Right!Goodrich: I got an eighteen plus uh, five.Spurrier: I got a sixteen plus one.Kyle: Okay so uh, you two start from opposite ends of the bar and you start going through everything, and you’re getting to the middle part and there’s like a big opening underneath the bar where it looks like there’s a lot of like, table clothes and stuff? And you know, it kind of looks like, hap-hazardly put in there, they don’t look very like well folded or anything. And, as you’re getting- starting to look at that, you see Yashee’s arm go over both of your heads and just grab a tavern tab, pull it and starts unloading beer and then this face comes out from the blanket area-[Players laugh]Kyle: -and Big Shot just like, half awoken kind of face with a big smile on it, and you see an arm shoot out with a glass and gets in the way of Yashee’s and starts filling up, and she’s just like-Kyle (as Big Shot): [Groggy] It’s morning, isn’t it?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah!Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah!Ali (as Yashee): Here we are!Spurrier (as Randy): Hello!Kyle: And she like, eyes at you two and looks up at the arm and she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): I recognize you two from somewhere...You’re the um, [inhales sharply] bards.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s the one-Ali (as Yashee): Yup!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s the ticket!Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah!Kyle: And she kind of crawls out and she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Get outta my way, gonna stand up.Kyle: She stands up and kind of dusts herself off, and Dewey kind of turns and is just like-Kyle (as Dewey): [Angry] Big Shot, what have I told you about getting back there and falling asleep? Y-you [sighs] I don’t know what to do with you, I'm glad they paid off your tab, whatever.Kyle: And he turns back and he starts doing his normal thing.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And uh-Goodrich: Well- so, I turn to Big Shot and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, so as you may have heard we did pay off your tab last night. Soo, uh what would you say to helping us out? Since we kind of helped you out a little bit.Kyle (as Big Shot): I can tell you right now since you paid off my tab, I feel like it’s maybe me who owes you a drink. Dewey’s got like the normal stock here but I’ve got a morning mango mimosa that can tie on really nice if you’d like to go have one.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Where was that at?Kyle (as Big Shot): My place.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, at your place? Oh! Then yeah, let’s go!Kyle: Alright, so she starts like sauntering out of the bar, swaying a little bit. She's talking-Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah, it’s just down the road here this way-Kyle: And you walk, take a couple turns through an alley- roll a dexterity save- no, I'm joking.[Players laugh]Kyle: There’s another falling boulder from nowhere!Goodrich: Aw, jeez!Kyle: No uh, that chaos is over-Ali: It followed us![All laugh]Kyle: It’s just been floating overhead like, [In a deep silly voice] “I’m gonna get them eventually! I’m gonna get those rascally bards!”[Laughter continues]Kyle: But no, she leads you around town for like, just a few minutes then comes up to this pretty nice-looking house, you know, in comparison to some of the other ones. You notice that there’s an upstairs window that’s broken out. She walks up to the front door and starts rifling through her pockets and produces a key, sticks the key in and turns it and she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Just right in here.Kyle: She starts pushing on the door and she’s putting a lot of force behind it. She’s barely gets it open and as she’s opening it [clanking of glass bottles] you can just hear like, the crinkling of bottles like, banging against each other and stuff like that-Goodrich: [Softly] Oh..Kyle: It’s like the door is just pushing a pile of bottles out of the way. And she gets it like halfway open and she like, slides in.Ali: [Surprised] Oh!Kyle: And she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah, come on in.Ali (as Yashee): Great!Goodrich: Fantastic.Kyle: Alright, so ya’ll walk in to a house that would be pretty nice if it weren’t for all the layers of dust and collection of bottles all on the ground. The smell of alcohol is actually more pungent than any tavern you’ve ever been in and you see that there’s like, different paintings on the walls and stuff that look really old and cobweb covered and everything. But, you notice they look like family portraits and it’s like a younger version of her with like, a man and a child. There’s different pictures of them being like deep in mines wearing hard hats and everything and smiling with dirt on their face. They look like a really happy family, and then there’s pictures of them like, swimming in a big lake- obviously not the oasis in town, but they’re just out doing things out in the world. Big Shot is sauntering over to the couch and kind of lies down on the couch and starts fishing lazily through the sea of bottles that’s near the sofa, seeing how full they are and everything. And she looks at you three, she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Okay so- I'll eventually find enough to make these- [mumbles] not that one-Kyle: She throws a bottle down. She lifts up another one-Kyle (as Big Shot): But while I look, why are you three here actually talking to me?Ali (as Yashee): Oh yeah! Well, do you happen to know this lady named Erin?[Goodrich chuckles]Ali (as Yashee): Erin Copeland?Kyle (as Big Shot): I- I knew-Ali (as Yashee): It’s said you might know of her or seen each other?Spurrier: “That’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time.”[Players chuckle]Goodrich: A long time.Kyle: No, she looks at you and she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Well uh, some people say they knew her. I’d say I know her.. Cause I am her.Ali (as Yashee): [Shocked] What!?Goodrich: Yashee!Ali (as Yashee): They’re the same person, guys!Goodrich: I just- I just pat you on the arm.Ali (as Yashee): I feel like somebody could have told us this earlier.[All laugh]Kyle: And uh, Erin kind of laughs and chuckles and she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Uh, you’re probably really fun to drink with. Which speaking of which-Kyle: She continues fishing around and she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah so uh, I'm Erin Copeland or some people tell you that I'm not anymore, which is fine. I don’t need to be.Spurrier (as Randy): And why is that?Kyle (as Big Shot): I don’t need anybody else's blood on my hands. Um, I don’t- [sighs] It's always really rough to talk about. You ever lose family? Anybody in your family die?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Lost in a sense.Kyle (as Big Shot): Was it your fault?Ali (as Yashee): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t think so.Spurrier (as Randy): Kind of?Kyle (as Big Shot): Okay well, then maybe you can understand little man but uh, I used to be the proprietor of the mine here in town. You know, I was good at it! I figured out new- different caverns and different ores, just had a nose for it. And one day you know, I got cocky and uh, I'm lucky uh- Boom Queen is still around, and poor Dewey got caught up in it and- I got cocky. And I thought we could make a blast, make a new cavern, find more, and it didn’t work out. There was a patch of natural gas that was trapped underneath the surface of where we were blasting and uh, we didn’t know it. That's why I hold my drink hard, cause as long as I'm like this nobody is gonna want my hand on their life. And I think that’s perfectly fine for me if it’s fine for them, and I think it’s right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, what if they wanted your hand back in their life? To help them out again?Kyle (as Big Shot): As long as it’s not in that capacity, and I know that that’s what that BOI man wants.Spurrier (as Randy): Do you know exactly what that BOi man wants you to even do? Have you even talked to him?Kyle (as Big Shot): I know he wants me to go underground for some reason or whatever may be happening with that meteor, he anticipates that he may need my proficiency and I just don’t think my proficiency is up to snuff to be able to provide him with the safety that he thinks he deserves.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well listen, we’ve only been here about a day and it seems to me the only thing you’re known for being proficient around here is getting your hooch on and-Kyle (as Big Shot): That’s right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, I dunno! Seems like you had a real talent before and they just want you to help out again and I think you could help a lot of people out. I mean, how many people are you helping out with all this dranking you’re doing? This hooching ain’t good for you either and everyone else, you know-Kyle (as Big Shot): I guess Philip Sand got the best out of that, I sold him the mine and he already owns the glassworks so.Spurrier: So, I turn to Erin and I say-Spurrier (as Randy): Uh Erin, can you give us one second? We’re gonna let you make those sweet, sweet drinks.Kyle (as Big Shot): Oh sure, absolutely! Give me a second here and you know, don’t mind the mess.Spurrier: I motion for you guys to come over-Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe, you know, we’ve got drinking songs what if we could make like an anti-drinking song? And get her all like, pumped up.[Kyle laughing]Spurrier (as Randy): Like, sober it up.Ali (as Yashee): Back to work mining song?Kyle: And don’t drink!Spurrier: Yeah, pretty much.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, cause I'm not drinking whatever she calls a mimosa. That is for sure.Spurrier (as Randy): And you dwarves will drink about just anything.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, well- [laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): Disgusting.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey!Goodrich: Yeah well I say, you know-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Our songs have worked out pretty well getting stuff done in the past.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, let’s see if we can convince her to help.Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe sober up just a tiny bit.Kyle: [Chuckles] Okay, so you want to do an encouraging song? Is that’s what’s going down?Spurrier: Yeees?Kyle: Then let’s roll some chord dice.[Players cheer][Electronic music plays]Kyle: Alright so, let’s roll some chord dice- but before we do you need to choose if you’ll be playing in minor-Spurrier: Right-Ali: Oh-Kyle: Or a major.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: To keep up the uh, tension.Spurrier: Now we’ve got those skills!Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Um..Ali: Guess it’s gonna be like uh, try to be uplifting, right?[Other players agree]Ali: Convincing.Kyle: Mkay.Goodrich: So maybe go major?[Players agreeing]Spurrier: Major seems the most logical, yeah.Goodrich: Let’s do it!Kyle: Alright, roll it up.[Multiple dice rolling]Goodrich: And I got A minors [laughs]Ali: I got a G!Goodrich: Oh, there you go!Kyle: I got an F.Spurrier: And I got an E minor.Kyle: Whoa.Goodrich: Whooa, so C, G, F, A minor and E minor- [gasps] We have one, six, four and five!Kyle: And three.Goodrich: And three! Oh my gosh, wow!Ali: Lucky day.[Overlapping conversation]Kyle: You better do good with this one.Goodrich: Yeah, but before we do..Kyle: Let’s roll-Goodrich: Ali, drum roll please.Kyle: [Chuckles] Oh, yes.Ali: I’m never prepared. [Coin hits the table] Alright, so that is tales!Kyle: Mkay.Ali: [Rolls dice] Alright so, ten.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Alright.Ali: Ooh, it’s gonna be techno three.Goodrich: [Sighs]Kyle: Alright-Goodrich: We’ve had so many techno rolls, it’s like-Spurrier: Yeah, but it’s gonna get them all pumped up though.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: She’s gonna not be drunk really soon!Goodrich: Huuu, get the blood flowing, metabolize.Kyle: Really sweat it out.Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Well, at least we have uh, eighty-one, which is techno four on the kit.Kyle: Wow.Goodrich: Oh, jeez.Ali: So, uh-Kyle: Man, maybe we’ve been doing the wrong genres of music all along.[All laugh]Kyle: Maybe techno is really Lindby’s calling.Goodrich: [Sighs] Yeah well, maybe!Kyle: Well, we’ll find out soon enough!

You say you got some history, and that’s no mystery. You numb the pain, to keep you sane. You tell us you’re a big shot, but that’s not right. Oh Erin, you know, it’s another day and you can find a way- Oh Erin, to grow. And you can be more than what they see. That your bottles are broken, your demons awoken and Erin’s gone away. But we know you’re in there, and deep down you still care, if Basom fades away.   Spurrier (singing): What do you say?[Music ends]Kyle: So, as you’re performing your song Erin is making up drinks and just- kinda just stops at a certain point and sets the bottles down and puts her hands on the table that she’s making these drinks at and leans forward, and her hair falls forward and kind of blocks out her face, but you can see the tears dripping from her nose and her chin. You wrap up the song and Randy you wrap up by saying, “what do you say?” and she kinda doesn’t turn to you and she starts, she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): [Sniffs] You wanna know what I say, Randy?Kyle: And then she turns and looks, and you can just see the tears streaming down her face, she’s like-Kyle (as Big Shot): You know, there’s truth in your words and you really struck a chord with me.[Players chuckle softly]Kyle (as Big Shot): I was really on the verge of just maybe you know, moving with the rest of everyone, but I think- I think you might be right and..maybe I need to stop holding myself so hardly.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, I know that you were worried about people that accidently got hurt before but-Kyle (as Big Shot): Mhm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): They’re about to enter a whole new world of hurt if they gotta leave the town, I mean..Spurrier (as Randy): The whole town is in a whole world of hurt.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s not just a couple anymore.Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah, I mean that’s- that’s true, and that’s something that- you know, ever since finding out last night, which- here, lemme just- lemme- lemme just ask you a real quick question before I get into any more details about what I know. Um, are you bureau employees? Are you here with that man from the BOI?Spurrier (as Randy): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nah, we’re just kids from school, B-big-Ali (as Yashee): B-big shot?Kyle (as Big Shot): You can call me Erin.[Players cheer]Kyle (as Big Shot): Or you can call me Big Shot, that’s fine.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nah, we’re just kids from school, Erin, you know.Kyle (as Big Shot): Yeah, well okay, I just wanted to make sure. So, that’s- that’s a good thing. So, you’re not beholding to their whims so uh, that really lets me know what kind of people you are if uh, gimmie one second.Kyle: And she walks over to a desk and grabs a large rolled up parchment. She comes back over and she clears off the coffee table of all the bottles and everything and unfurls a giant map of the area in front of you. She looks at you three and is like-Kyle (as Big Shot): Okay, so last night I fell asleep in the alley that I bumped into you three yesterday and there was scream that woke me up.Ali (as Yashee): She said she bumped into us that time!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, you owe us a drink!Ali (as Yashee): Told you!Kyle: Yeah-[Players laugh]Kyle (as Big Shot): No, you got me that drink, Dewey told me that you took care of my tab.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, you owe us a drink if it’s you that bumped into us.Kyle (as Big Shot): Oh! Oh yeah that’s- see? You’re learning the ways. That’s right, that’s right. So anyway, I heard someone scream and it woke me up and you know, next thing I know I see little Dogum. He's running towards Tony’s house stammering about all the water being gone and you know, just running down the road in his underwear and I thought, maybe he’s hit the bottle a little more than me tonight.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Big Shot): So I wasn’t sure. So I checked it out and sure enough it’s like Altonia herself stuck a straw in that thing and sucked it dry. So, I ran home and I did the head work.Kyle: She points out slightly south of where the mines are on the map, she says-Kyle (as Big Shot): Okay, about here is where we redirected water about thirteen years ago or so? And that was so we could tunnel a little bit deeper into the mine, and based on what I know about this area I’m more than positive that this sky boulder has caused some sort of structural damage near the source of water. Long story short, if I go down there, I’m gonna look for this area, and you’re gonna help me locate it. And if we can do something about it, you’re gonna help me there too. Agreed?Ali (as Yashee): Let’s do it!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sounds good!Kyle (as Big Shot): Cool, that’s good to know, but we have one person to visit before we got out because, it’s just a close friend of mine who's been having troubles ever since this meteor came down. When we get there, you’ll know exactly what you need to do. If you really want my help, help this townsperson, just this one last one and then we can get on our way. How's that sound?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, it sounds good.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, sure.Spurrier (as Randy): Mhm!Kyle (as Big Shot): Awesome, I know the they’ll appreciate it.Kyle: So, she gets up, she opens up a closet near the front door and grabs a super dusty old backpack from inside. She sweeps away cobwebs and dust and everything like that and clears it off, and she looks in your direction and says-Kyle (as Big Shot): Alright, lets get![Theme song plays]-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-14-bardception,Ep. 14 – Bardception,"Ep. 14 – BardceptionKyle: I heard they’re making a new sea-based Zelda- kind of like Wind Waker -Goodrich: Yeah?Kyle: Instead of getting a raft this time you get a- [yelling like Link] “YACHT.”[All laugh][Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed! Let’s recap last episode real quick. So, we started off with the bards experimenting a little bit with Randy’s back. Didn't find out much from it but there’s still a lot time ahead of us, we’ll see what happens there.Goodrich: Still don’t know if it’s freakin’ Eddie.[Players softly agreeing]Kyle: Eh, not sure yet.Goodrich: Ya know, maybe you just have like, worms or something?[All laugh]Spurrier: Just some fancy worms!Goodrich: Well, but- you do walk around barefoot, and you can get hook worms-Ali: Randy is not the cleanest boy.Spurrier: Yeah, that’s true.Goodrich: I dunno, maybe we need to give you like little treats wrapped in slices of lunch meat.[All chuckling]Kyle: You just gotta watch for him rubbing his butt on the carpet.[All laugh]Kyle: So, but after that you decided to get some sleep and during which you each had your own interesting little dreams. Then you woke up in the morning and you got a little bit of breakfast from Dewey-Spurrier: Didn’t have to sing for it.Kyle: Didn’t have to sing for it, nope.Spurrier: [Softly] Thanks, Kyle.Kyle: Maybe someday again. But during that there was you know, a town crier that came by, alerted everyone to a town meeting. Pretty much everyone went to that except for you three, who decided to eat your breakfast, which caused you to come in half way through a speech given by Tony Dantell.Goodrich: No regrets.Kyle: Which was the man leaving the- yeah, absolutely.Ali: Most important meal-Goodrich: Seriously, Kyle-Kyle: That’s how you gotta start off, that’s right, I don’t blame you. Tony gives a speech and you know, tells them about how the town has lost its oasis and how pretty much everyone’s gonna have to move and man, this really sucks. But after that everyone dispersed and you three noticed Symbol who was hanging out in his Luey Hewis outfit, he waved you over to the group and you met the people that are gonna be part of this expedition. So, after getting a little acquainted with everyone, you actually found out you needed to go and find Erin Copeland. And from talking to a couple of the other townsfolks, specifically Boom Queen and Whimpy, you found out that Erin Copeland is Big Shot. So, you hunted down Big Shot, you wound up going back to her place, she was gonna make you some drinks and in that moment, you found out a little about her, her backstory, why she is the way she is. And you were able to coerce her through your song to actually want help the town and join this expedition.Goodrich: Hopefully we did more than coerce, [chuckling] hopefully she really feels changed-Kyle: Yeah, no, no- I mean- yeah, coerced was a wrong word, so you were able to convince her that her abilities were a benefit to the town's future.Goodrich: Perfect!Kyle: There we go! So, after that she let you know like, hey I actually looked into this last night and found possibly the reason for this could be relevant to the meteor coming in. So pretty much, you guys agreed to help her out and then she was like, well before we go we’re gonna help one more person in the town. So, we’re gonna pick up there. You're pretty much heading out from Erin’s house to go do this.Goodrich: Sweeet, let’s boogie!Kyle: Alright, so ya’ll leave Erin’s house and you’re making your way through the streets of Basom. Along the way, people are giving you kind of really like, different looks. Some of them are surprised, some of them are a little confused. Definitely some mean side-eye coming your way. But you eventually reach a line of smaller houses and walking down the road you see a young woman walking in your direction, and it’s the woman that had crutches from the tavern last night-Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: Erin looks at you three and she says-Kyle (as Erin): Um, gimmie- gimmie just one second.Kyle: So, she takes a short aside with this girl and returns to you three shaking her head and she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Alright, let’s get going. Terrible thing that happened to that girl.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wha- what happened to her?Kyle (as Erin): That’s actually Tony’s daughter, um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Surprised] The one they’re looking for!?Kyle (as Erin): No, no-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We found her![Players laugh and cheer]Kyle (as Erin): I wish it would be so easy. No uh, Jenny is the one that’s missing, that’s Mary.Goodrich: [Disappointed] Oh.Kyle (as Erin): Mary used to be the best dancer in our town, she was really gonna go some places but uh, I don’t- I don’t think that’s really an option since the night the meteor landed.Goodrich: Can we- can we see like, how bad off her leg is? Like, is she missing her leg is-Kyle: Yeah, she’s missing a leg-Goodrich: [Concerned] Oooh..Kyle: She’s walking on crutches-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: Still looks like, freshly bandaged but you know it’s-Ali (as Yashee): [Concerned] Did it land on her?Kyle (as Erin): Well she was- she was out there with some other children, which we’re actually going to see the Pell brothers right now so- I've only heard they were out there together, you know, some of the kids like to sneak out to the Glow Fields at night, you know, get into a little bit of trouble [chuckles] you know how it is when you’re younger. It's been awhile for me but-Goodrich: I make a mental note.[All laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] To remind you guys later!Ali: [Laughing] To go bother more children!Goodrich: [Laughing] No, no, no! Cause I want to have fun! I hate you guys![Laughter continues]Goodrich: Screw you guys!Kyle: [Imitating Cartmen from South Park] Screw you guys, I’m going home!Goodrich: ‘Cause I want. To go have fun. At the Glow Fields! I’m done performing for kids![Kyle laughs]Goodrich: That’s it!Kyle (as Erin): Oh, well that’s upsetting to hear Raz’ul, that’s kind of what we’re going to do-[Goodrich laughs]Kyle (as Erin): Well, the Pell brothers have been having some trouble sleeping since that night and-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wait like, are they having bad dreams?Kyle (as Erin): I don’t know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Erin): I just know they’re not- they're not sleeping well so, we’re actually headed that way so, let’s go head- it's just a couple of doors down- maybe three doors down-Goodrich: [Laughing] Three doors down![Players laugh]Kyle: But she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): We’ll find out more, just follow me, let’s see if we can’t get them helped out.Kyle: So, she walks up to the door of one of these houses and opens it up and you’re standing to the side, and she’s running in to somebody and she has to side-step them a little bit, and out walks a very tired looking Fingerbones.Goodrich: [Excited] Fingerbones![Players happily greeting Fibblewix]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): How’s it going buddy?Kyle (as Fibblewix): [Tiredly] Hey guys, it’s been a long night, how uh, how-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Were you up all night practicing like we said?Kyle (as Fibblewix): Well you know, I went home and I was showing my mom everything that you three taught me and everything and, she thought maybe I could to a service to some of the kids, maybe I could help them with their sleeping problem. So, she sent me over here last night after, you know, me singing your praises.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you know any lullabies?Kyle (as Fibblewix): Well..Kyle: And he kind of holds up his fingers and he’s holding up his lute, and you can see that there’s a string broken on it, and Raz’ul you recognize that his fingers are bruised and bloodied from too much playing.Goodrich: [Realization] Uh oh!Spurrier: The bones are sticking out.[Players groan in slight disgusted]Spurrier: Thus, the namesake.Kyle: Yeah, kind of holds up his hands, he’s like-Kyle (as Fibblewix): I- I tried everything that I could and I just- nothing really seemed to help or land. But, I mean, you three might actually be able to do something, I just..Goodrich: There really aren’t bones sticking out of his fingers, right? It's just-Kyle: No![All laugh]Kyle: [Seriously] There could be.Spurrier: No, no.Kyle: He could have really played his fingers to the bone.Goodrich: I was gonna say, you never- this is a fantasy world that-Kyle: Oh yeah, I mean.. If you’re undead it’d be easy-Goodrich: Right-Kyle: At a certain point. But yeah, but he just says-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Well I really think you could- I'm- I'm gonna go get some sleep.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright-Kyle: (as Fibblewix): You know?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah-Kyle (as Fibblewix): I would love to jam with you three again but my finger bones..they- they’re done.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, well uh, hey you know what? That's okay, good on you practicing though that’s key to getting better at your craft, okay?Kyle: He tiredly smiles at you and he’s just like-Kyle (as Fibblewix): I appreciate that, Raz’ul.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, but go get some sleep, for real. You look terrible.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Fibblewix): T..thanks? Alright, well best of luck to you!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, where are these kids? Where-Kyle (as Fibblewix): Mind the screams.Goodrich: What?Kyle: And he walks off.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye, Fingerbones!Kyle: Erin like, sticks her head out of the door, she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Hey! Come on in here.Goodrich: Uh..Ali (as Yashee): Let’s go.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle: Alright so, you walk in and you see a tired man slouched over a desk. He appears to be asleep and Erin goes to like, put her hand on his shoulder and right before she does you hear the screams of two people come from the door to your left, and the man bolts up from his chair and runs into the room yelling-Kyle (as Father): [Yelling] I’m here, boys, I'm here!Kyle: What do you do?Goodrich: Okay, we need a young priest and an old priest.[All laugh]Goodrich: Is what I say to you!Spurrier: Well I could just sneak on over there and poke my head in there real quick.Kyle: Yeah, if you wanna do that.Spurrier: I don’t wanna bother them, so-Ali: Did Erin go in there to see what’s going on or is she-Kyle: No, Erin is standing there looking kind of confused and just-Spurrier: Okay, well I'm just gonna head on over there really quick.Kyle: Okay, gimmie that stealth.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is a nineteen plus nine.Kyle: Okay [chuckles] you sneak on over there-Goodrich: You like bamf in there like Nightcrawler![Players laugh]Spurrier: I’m like crawling on the ceiling and such.[Laughter continues]Goodrich: Let’s keep with that Exorcist theme! You’re crawling on the ceiling and your head cranes all the way around!Spurrier: [Imitates a creaking sound]Goodrich: [Does the same]Kyle: That’s Eddie really working it out.[Players agree]Kyle: But you enter the room, you stick your head in there and you see twin teens lying on like a shared bed and their father is just comforting them. Like-Kyle (as Father): I’m here, I'm here.Kyle: You know? And he kind of looks up and around, and then looks back down.Spurrier; Okay, well I crawl back down the wall to you guys and uh-[Soft chuckling]Spurrier (as Randy): I think we can probably head in there if we uh, are ginger about it.Goodrich: No pun intended.Spurrier: Yeah-[All laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] Ginger boy.Spurrier (as Randy): So yeah let’s uh, ease our way in there-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Erin you wanna come with-Spurrier (as Randy): Take it slow-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, yeah I'll follow behind ya’ll, see what you do.Kyle: You follow in and you see what I just explained to Randy, and the father looks up and he finally sees somebody standing there and he says-Kyle (as Father): Uh, where did Fibblewix go?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Look doc, he needs some rest. He said he was up all night trying to fix what ever going on in here, wasn’t getting nowhere so.Spurrier (as Randy): He’s worked himself to the finger bones.Goodrich: [Laughing] Fingerbones, yeah.Kyle: And he kind of just rubs his head and then Erin chimes in and she says-Kyle (as Erin): Duke, these are bards from Strumlotts. I think they can play a song or do something to help with your boys sleeping, right?Kyle: And she nudges Randy.Kyle (as Erin): Right? Ya’ll can help right?Spurrier (as Randy): [Suddenly] Yeah, yeah! We would be happy to.Kyle: After you say that you hear one of the boys-Kyle (as Boy): It’s not- it's not the sleeping, it’s the nightmares.Kyle: And the dad says-Kyle (as Duke): Hoo, just calm down, it’ll be alright.Goodrich: Hoo?Kyle (as Duke): That’s his middle name, his first name is Mott but he likes to go by Hoo.Spurrier: They’re the Pell brothers.[All chuckle]Goodrich: Okay, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Hoo, um, you having nightmares?Kyle (as Hoo): Well, both me and my brother Trip are both having nightmares and it all kind of started the night that meteor came down.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah? Uh, well where were you when the meteor hit? What were you doing?Kyle (as Hoo): We were out in the Glow Field, where we were.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): ‘Kaay-Kyle (as Hoo): We were out there with the Dantell sisters. Kinda snuck out, took some sandatees and made our way over there- you know, fun little night time thing. But we saw the meteor coming in and we didn’t think anything of it but, you know-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You didn’t think anything of a giant flaming ball crashing to earth!?Kyle (as Hoo): Well, at first it wasn’t heading towards us and then it like-Goodrich: Oooh..Kyle (as Hoo): It’s like somebody whacked it and it just curved heading right in our direction.Goodrich: Hmm..Kyle (as Hoo): And you know, we didn’t have time to react and Jenny's been gone, Mary lost her leg and fortunately me and my brother are alive but these nightmares have been goin’ on every night I- you're here for the nightmares I'm sorry.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I gotta tell ya, I had quite a nacht-mare myself the other night. Did you guys- I figure it was just a scary goofy dream but-Kyle (as Hoo): Did you see the crazy meatballs?Ali: [Gasps]Goodrich: Oh..Ali (as Yashee): [Softly] What?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No..Kyle (as Hoo): Did you see Jenny?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jenny? Uhhh..Kyle (as Hoo): Yeah, the missing Dantell girl.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Crazy meatballs, let’s circle back to that. What are crazy meatballs?Kyle (as Hoo): Oh, well, every time the way it starts off is- Jenny is standing there, we’re out in the Glow Fields still, and Jenny’s standing there and she’s just like, “Hey come on! Come on!” We follow her and all the sudden she turns and starts walking and then she like, falls apart, like her body turns into a bunch of little like, pink mounds of ground meat and-Ali (as Yashee): Is this where the meatballs come in?Kyle (as Hoo): Yeah, these meat balls- the meatballs come in here-Ali (as Yashee): Okay-Kyle (as Hoo): And then they fall apart and then they start coming at us. Next thing you know they overcome us and start dragging us towards the edge of this cliff that isn’t out there! We get over to the cliff and we’re just hanging on, the only thing underneath us is this giant circular maw.Kyle: Which if you need a vision imagine the Sarlacc Pit.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle (as Hoo): But there’s this giant circular maw and we start screaming and we typically wake up right before we fall in.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh yeah, my- I didn’t see any meatballs, didn’t see Jenny I don’t think. My was like, I was back at Mt. Tain, and I saw an old dwarf I know and it’s kind of spooky and it woke me up and I felt really sa-ad but-Kyle: Mkay-Goodrich: I turn to Yashee and Randy-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We kind of talked about it, you had some bad dreams too right?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, mine was pretty weird.Spurrier (as Randy): I-Ali (as Yashee): Nothing like that though. No meatballs, I wish I had dreams about meatballs.[All laugh]Kyle (as Hoo): Did you see each other in your dreams? Cause me and my brother, we’re sharing a dream right now.Goodrich: (as Raz’ul): Whoa!Kyle (as Hoo): I mean- and I’m not being metaphorical and like hope or anything-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right- [chuckles]Kyle (as Hoo): Like, we’re literally sharing this nightmare.Goodrich: Are we in it? Wait, are we in his dream? Wait- hang on-Kyle: Are you dreaming right now!?Spurrier: And I smack you!Goodrich: Oh god![All laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Are you dreaming!?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, thank you.Ali (as Yashee): Get it together down there, bud.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, I mean I didn’t see you guys in my dream.[Players agree]Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, I was gonna say, seems a little more personal.Ali (as Yashee): Have you guys been down to the Glow Field since the meteor day?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, what do you guys do there? Like, what is this Glow Field?Kyle (as Hoo): It’s this field of stones and during the day they’re almost like onyx, I think that’s the right rock, I don’t know. You might know better than me, but yeah no, we just go out to the Glow Fields cause it's kind of cool. I mean, at night those black rocks turn into this kind of nice blue emanating light.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ooh, cool!Goodrich: I make another mental note.Kyle (as Hoo): Well it’s just-Goodrich: And I will assure you that the mental notes are stacking![All laugh]Goodrich: Well, I turn to the dad and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What can we do to help?Goodrich: [Chuckles]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What was Fingerbones trying to do here?Kyle (as Father): Well, I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He wasn’t like a psychiatrist or anything, he said he was playing so.Kyle (as Father): Nah, Fingerbones was trying to you know, play some you know, lullabies we have around here. It’s not the getting to sleep problem, it’s the nightmare itself so- I mean-Ali (as Yashee): We need to reach the subconscious.Goodrich: Can we do that- can we write a song to get into their mindscape?Ali: Yeah-Kyle: You can certainly try.Goodrich: Ohhh..Kyle: You look over, your passive perception- you notice a top is spinning in the corner.[Players gasp]Goodrich: Uh, I wanna take out Usumptin real quick and see if it’s glowing, if that’s cool.Kyle: You pull it out, you put your hands on it- what are you thinking about?Goodrich: [Confused] What am I thinking about?Kyle: Yeah, as you grab your instrument, I mean what’s- what’s going through your mind as you’re grabbing your instrument?Goodrich: You know- I wonder what the heck Fingerbones tried so I don’t try the same thing? Cause I wanna help this kid- [chuckles] these kids out?Kyle: Mkay-Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle: So, you’re thinking that as you grab your instrument and there’s like, a slight glow. I mean, it’s not nearly as bright as it’s been but you know there’s like a small reaction.Goodrich: Do I notice I have to think something to get it to glow more?Kyle: No- I mean, you as a player know your minds in a certain place-Goodrich: Right-Kyle: But, it’s not-Goodrich: To Raz’ul it’s like, “oh it’s a little bit glowy.”Kyle: Yeah, you may not be putting the connection together yet.Goodrich: Gotcha, I guess I turn to you guys and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey check it out, there's a little tiny bit of glow on the horizon here-Ali (as Yashee): [Surprised] Oh!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You guys got the same?Ali: I'm gonna check out my mallets.Spurrier: Yeah, check out the organ.Kyle: Okay, what are you two thinking when you grab your instruments?Spurrier: I’m thinking we need to knock these kids out so we can get inside their minds.Goodrich: Aw jeez, you guys are so ready- [laughs]Kyle: [Amused] Alright, as you’re thinking that as you grab your instrument and your instrument is glowing a little bit brighter than Raz’ul’s is.Spurrier: Ha ha!Goodrich: [Quickly] Uh, I'm thinking the same thing! But I'm gonna go in MORE than Randy does!Spurrier: [Softly] Aw, damnit.Kyle: It starts to glow a little bit more. Yashee?[Goodrich yells]Ali: I’m still kind of on the meatballs thing?Kyle: [Laughing] Okay!Goodrich: They explode with light! [laughs] Light just fills the room!Ali: I’m just kind of like, okay so why haven’t I had meatballs in my dreams? And-[All laugh]Gooodrich: I want to go to there-Ali: Yeah.Kyle: [Laughing] Your instrument’s not really glowing-Ali: But I’m thinking about the kids dreams too and- and like-Kyle: Okay-Ali: And like the scene they put the meatballs in-Kyle: Okay-Ali: That’s kind of what I'm replaying in my mind.Kyle: Okay! So, you start of thinking about meatballs-Ali: Mhm-Kyle: And as your mind wanders towards the kids in their dream it starts to like, flitter a little bit. The light kind of flickers on just a little bit.Ali (as Yashee): Oh! Well, mines kinda there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Turn them off and on again, I don’t know how this works! [chuckles]Ali: Tap it on the ground a couple times- Kyle: It’s like, berk, bonk- cuts out a little bit, you know, half way there. But yeah, Randy your instrument is definitely glowing the brightest.Spurrier: Alright, well-Kyle: Winner!Spurrier: Winner! Yes! Well uh, I don’t know what they’re trying to tell us but we’re here to do something so we might as well do it if we got the means. So I turn to the twins and um, because I want to insure this works I'm going to cast sleep as a second level spell.Goodrich: Should we like, ask the dad’s permission first-Spurrier: Nope![All laugh]Spurrier: It’s Randy, I'm going for it. Alright so I turn to the twins-Goodrich: And I say, [slowly] waaait!Spurrier: Nope! So yeah, it’s a second level spell so instead I'm gonna sing uh-Kyle: Real quick, before you get into that- you hear a little voice in the back of your head that says-Kyle (as Eddie): [Groans] Hey- hey there, Randy! So uh, I know you’re gonna put these kids to sleep but if they’re having weird visions and seeing weird things [amused] maybe we could just make them blind?Spurrier (as Randy) Wha- [chuckles] you’re helpful as always.Kyle (as Eddie): Yeah!Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, no?Kyle (as Eddie): No?Spurrier (as Randy): I should say not.Kyle (as Eddie): Come on use a little bit- use a little bit more magics in that and let’s see if we can make them blind.Kyle: Go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] God- alright, [Goodrich groans] that’s a three plus nothing-[Kyle bursts out laughing]Goodrich: Oh my gosh![Players chuckling]Kyle: Alright, so instead of casting what you were going to cast you will be casting blindness on one of them.Goodrich: Oh boy.Kyle (as Eddie): We’ll blind Hoo, he seems to be talkative, he’s the one who described everything so you know, he’s probably seen it in vivid detail in the phantasmagorical place of his mind.Spurrier: And I guess at this point I don’t have anything to say so I just- Randy lifts up his shirt and-[Players chuckle]Spurrier (as Randy): [Distorted] Yooou’re super blind!Kyle: [Amused] Alright! You see Randy lift up his shirt aand Eddie Izzard Wizard magical stuff comes out, and the kid Hoo just says-Kyle (as Hoo): [Panicked] Wha- what did you do!? I can’t see anything!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Scolding] Randy! Rude!Spurrier (as Randy) [Softly] Aaand..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Honestly, wha-Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That’s sixteen plus nine for stealth![Players laugh]Kyle: Okay, so you kind of cast the spell and then you realize for a second what you’ve done-Goodrich: Jump under the bed!Kyle: Yup! You slide under the bed, and it’s one of those things where- yes you roll stealthily, you’re definitely not in anyone's vision, but everyone knows where you are![Players laugh]Kyle: So, Erin and the father kind of lift up the bed skirt and are like-Kyle (as Erin): What are you doing? What was that!?Spurrier (as Randy): [Slowly] I am..keeping the visions out..they can’t see the bad meat.[Goodrich sighs]Kyle (as Erin): Okay, um-Spurrier (as Randy): I’m passing the baton! Raz’ul, let’s help!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know sleep! What are you doing!? [Laughs]Kyle (as Father): I mean if you were trying to put them to sleep that would work well but what happened?Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe I'll give it a second go. I'm just gonna play from under here if that’s okay.Kyle: Yeah- you hear in the back of your mind you hear- you just hear-Kyle (as Eddie): [Echoing chuckle] Yes, that was good-Spurrier: Oh god, so I'm gonna give this another go.Goodrich: This is why we can’t have nice things like, responsible halflings.[All chuckle]Spurrier: So yes, I am gonna do this as a second level spell so I have a very good chance of putting them both to sleep.Kyle: Mhm.Spurrier: So, yeah!Spurrier (as Randy): [Singing, soft piano plays] I’ll sing you to sleep, these twins go to sleep. You're tired, and you want to go to bed.Kyle: Alright, go ahead and roll the hit dice for that.Spurrier: I’m gonna need everyone's help cause that’s gonna be seventy-eight over all?[All mumbling in shock]Spurrier: If this doesn’t put them to sleep, oh boy.Ali: [Softly] I got two.Goodrich: So, we can use the chord dice, we’re gonna use the chord dice. They have numbers on them in case we need to use them as eight-sided dice. So, you know-Spurrier: Versatile.Goodrich: If the songs start to just suck after this roll it’s because we- [rolling dice]Kyle: Used up the magic.Spurrier: One, eight, two, five, six, five, five.Kyle: A-sleep.Spurrier: A-sleep!Kyle: Yup.Spurrier: Don’t even need to ask.Goodrich: Nope!Kyle: They’re just zonked out and I think that spell lasts about a minute, right?Spurrier: Uuum-Goodrich: But in the dream scape it’ll be like, two hours!Kyle: Yeah no, dreams can last forever- wait, that sounds really dark and menacing, never mind![Players chuckle]Spurrier (as Randy): Minus the blindness I've done my part, it’s on to you guys.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aw jeez.Kyle: The father says-Kyle (as Father): At least he’s asleep now..Spurrier (as Randy): He won’t be blind in like oh, a minute or so- it's fine.Kyle: I think you can cancel the spell effects whenever you feel like it so-Spurrier (as Randy): When he wakes up, he shouldn’t be blind. [Pauses] It should be fine.Kyle: He will not be blind; you know that magically inside of you.Spurrier: Yes! Deep inside of me.Goodrich: Jeez-Spurrier: And I laugh right back at Eddie.[Kyle and Spurrier chuckling at each other]Goodrich: Ali and I are gonna go get a sandwich while you two just battle- Eddie, Randy battle Royale.[All laugh]Kyle: Okay-Spurrier: Well we got some glows going.Kyle: Erin looks at you three and goes-Kyle (as Erin): Alright, alright, so ya’ll got ‘em to sleep so what are you gonna do now?Spurrier (as Randy): We should probably act, this the spell doesn’t last super long.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know how to do this guys, I-Goodrich: I pull up the bedskirt and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You’re the one with the instrument that’s glowing the most-Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s get in there!Goodrich: So, do we both crawl under the bed? I'm gonna crawl under there.Ali: I’ll just stick my head just right under.Kyle: [Amused] Okay. So, you three are pretty much under the bed. Yashee, just your head is under the bed and you hear Duke and Erin say-Kyle (as Duke and Erin): What are you doing!?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): This is how it’s done-Spurrier (as Randy): We’re getting ready-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let the professionals work please.Kyle (as Erin): Alright, we’ll leave you to it.Kyle: You hear them walk out of the room.Spurrier: Awesome.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, so uh.. That song you sung was really great but was that Eddie again?Spurrier (as Randy): For what?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): For you casting blindness- did you-Spurrier (as Randy): Uh..Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, you wouldn’t want to like, blind some kids.Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, not usually. But yeah, for these people no, so yes that was Eddie.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Sighs] Look-Spurrier (as Randy): I tried, I tried to fight back-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): When this is over, we should really talk about that again.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah but, time is of the essence-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Time is- I know, I know. Alright, let’s do this.[Electronic music plays]Goodrich: So Kyle, like, what’s going on here in terms of what we’re trying to achieve? Like, are we trying to write a song to get into their- are we writing an inception song!?

The Fields start to glow, and that’s how you know your nightmare has begun. When Jenny starts to call, try’n to get you boys to fall, turn your tails and run. Oh, you dream boys.  Oh, you dream boys. Goodrich and Spurrier (singing): And If she turns to meat-Ali (singing): That could be a tasty treat. Goodrich and Spurrier (singing): Yeah but Yashee let’s make a plan.  All(singing): If the boys are safe and sound, and the meat’s still on the ground, we’ll do all that we can.  For you dream boys, for you dream boys, for you dream boys, for you dream boys.[Music fades out]Kyle: So, you three start playing and the magical essence of your instruments starts to flow out of them. Raz’ul you’re still under the bed, Randy you’re still under the bed, Yashee-Goodrich: Minus his hands-Kyle: Yeah, minus your hands, Yashee you’re kind of..not really.Ali: [Amused] I’m mostly not under the bed.Kyle: Mostly not under the bed, that’s right.Goodrich: The way that I have this pictured is that our three heads are just all touching, like [singing] dreaaam boys![All laugh]Goodrich: You know?Kyle: Yes- no, that’s perfect.Goodrich: So, it could float upwards into the bed!Spurrier: Into their minds.Kyle: And that it does. It floats upwards into their mind beds and you start to hear a voice and it says-Kyle (as Echoing voice): Come- come on, Hoo! Come on, Trip! Follow me!Kyle: Your music’s resonating with the twins and they’re like-Kyle (as Hoo): [Echoing] I don’t- I don’t know if we should.Goodrich: Are we there too? Like, what's our deal?Kyle: You’re not seeing anything; you’re just hearing this in your head.Spurrier: Oh, okay!Goodrich: Gotcha.Kyle: And then you hear the voice say-Kyle (as Echoing voice): Who’s here with you? And how are- [angry] how are they here!?[Players gasp a bit in shock]Kyle: And all the sudden you just hear static and everything cuts. You finish your song and everything but you’re not hearing any more than that. What are you gonna do after that?Ali: Uh, let's check on the boys.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Yeah, let’s check out those dream boys, yeah.Kyle: You crawl out from under the bed and see the boys sleeping on the bed just fine-Ali: Still sleeping?Kyle: Still sleeping.Ali: They look peaceful?Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: They’re not screaming?Kyle: They’re not screaming, they’re sleeping and they uh, they look really really peaceful.Ali: Alright well, we should not wake them up.Spurrier: Yeah, let's let them be.Ali: This is that good sleep that they need.Goodrich: Yes, agreed.Kyle: Mkay, you hear the door creak a little bit and you see the dad and Erin stumble in-Goodrich: And I say- shhh!Ali: And I’ll do it- shhh![All shushing quietly]Kyle: And he like, gestures you-Kyle (as Father): [Whispering] Come on out.Goodrich: Oh yeah, we gotta come out-Ali: I tip toe, beep, beep, beep-Kyle: So, you walk out. Randy you slowly close that door and just- [soft click]Spurrier: Yeah-Kyle: Yeah, the dad’s just standing there and he’s like-Kyle (as Father): Did it go well?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, good news, bad news time. Yes. Bad news, there’s probably some sort of entity that’s entering your children's dreamscape and causing them to freak out, turn people into meat.Kyle: He looks really concerned.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Good news! We wrote a pretty cool song! And I think it’s one we’ll probably work in on rotation-Spurrier (as Randy): And it might have scared him away-[Players agree]Ali (as Yashee): They’re sleeping and they’re not screaming.Kyle (as Father): That’s- that’s exactly what I need. Maybe now I can get some sleep.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah!Kyle (as Father): I don’t know if you know but trying to sleep with other people screaming around is..not very restful.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Chuckles] Yeah well, trying to do magic and stuff when you got a crazy little wizard living inside someone that just blinds people on impulse is uh-Kyle (as Father): I wouldn’t-[Goodrich laughs]Kyle (as Father): I definitely wouldn’t know anything about that.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s a metaphor.Goodrich: [Laughing] It’s a metaphor!Kyle: Erin give you a very like- turns her head, “whaaaat?”Spurrier (as Randy): A metaphor, It's a metaphor.[Players agreeing quickly]Spurrier (as Randy): It’s a dwarven metaphor.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): True, it means..I gotchu.Kyle (as Father): Okay, well-Kyle: And he turns to Erin and he’s like-Kyle (as Father): Erin, thank you for bringing these bards here. Uh, what- I didn’t catch your names.Ali (as Yashee): Well, I'm Yashee.Spurrier (as Randy): And I’m Randy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And I’m Raz’ul.Kyle (as Father): Excellent, well pleasure to meet you. Uh, if you’re going to be in Basom- if you’re going to stay here for a little while- you've done me and my family a service, I'd be more than happy to have you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool!Goodrich: And I do what we always do, hand him our card, Chaos Sauce, blah blah blah.Kyle: He takes the card.Goodrich: Custom lullabies for your kids, I mean- anything you need really. Hit us up.Kyle: He goes over, puts it in his rolodex-Goodrich: Good.Spurrier: Phew!Kyle: And Erin’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Alright, let’s go ahead and head on out.[Players agree excitedly]Kyle: So, you step outside and Erin turns to you three. She's just like-Kyle (as Big Shot): I knew I had a good feeling about you. You were very encouraging with me, and I'm just- I'm more than elated to see you help out the Pell twins cause they’ve been having a rough go of it since that meteor landed. Which-Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle (as Erin): Speaking of which, is the rest of the expedition waiting for us or are we meeting them?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we’re meeting them at the oasis.Kyle (as Erin): Oh okay, well- how- we should probably get going, I guess.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Tally-ho!Kyle: So, you begin to make your way back to the oasis with Erin in tow and everything. And you see the rest of the group waiting there and as you walk up with Erin you see Boom Queen just taking a drink out of a cup and just spews it all over Whimpy-[Players laugh]Kyle: Upon seeing Erin walking with you three. And John has a very pleasantly surprised look on his face, but without skipping a beat, you walking up and he says-Kyle (as John): Alright, let’s get out to the sandatees and head on out to the site.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, question? What are sandatees? I've heard that a few times, I'm not a hundred percent sure what they are.Kyle (as John): You’ll see them in a second, they’ll be mounts for us, they’ll help us get across the sand a little easier. They look like they’re not dexterous but they work well in sand.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Goodrich: I put my hand down.[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Thank you.Kyle (as John): There are no bad questions. Alright, let’s go!Kyle: Alright so, you head further sound and eventually reach the edge of town. There's a ranch, it has a fence set up and there are twelve posts set up, and you can see that ten out of the twelve have these really big looking sand cow looking things. Kinda look like- what we would this as a manatee..but on sand!Goodrich: [Laughs] Okay?Kyle: Yeah!Ali: Sandatee-Goodrich: [With realization] Oooh!Spurrier: Yes!Goodrich: I got it![Overlapping conversation]Kyle: Alright, so you know what’s going on with the sandatee now.Goodrich: Yup, yup I got it.Kyle: Anyway, people are putting their bags on them and loading up all the cargo-Goodrich: [Laughing] they’re putting saddles on-Kyle: You know, the saddle bags and what not for their sandatees. John lets you know, he’s just like-Kyle (as John): Go ahead and pack up everything, hop on and head out it should be a few hours barring any- you know, adverse weather.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, Yashee you might need to help Randy and I up on our sandatees.Ali: Oh. [Giggles] They don’t have a little stool or something-Goodrich: [Sadly] Just help us up, please?Ali: Alright, alright.Ali (as Yashee): Here you go guys.Ali: Um, does everyone have their own?Goodrich: Or should we just ride with Yashee?Kyle: Yeah, everyone has their own.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: There is one for everyone if you wanted. You could do whatever you want though.Goodrich: Well are there like smaller ones? How easy are these animals to control?Ali: Maybe you and Randy could ride together on one.Goodrich: Okay, do you wanna ride on one with me?Ali: Yeah, so I’ll pick you up and stick you over and say-Ali (as Yashee): You guys can probably-Goodrich: Is there like a dromedary sandatee so that- [laughs] there’s two humps on it?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: [Mumbling] Or is that Bactrian? I don’t remember.Spurrier: I’m gonna stand on the front of it and be the mast head.[Players laugh and agree]Spurrier: Be ready to go, pointing into the wind.Goodrich: Yes!Kyle: Okay, before you do that though, Randy- as you’re getting set up..you hear a little voice in your head again.Spurrier: [Sighs]Goodrich: Not again, two in one session.Kyle: He’s like-Kyle (as Eddie): Hey Randy, you should just uh, loosen Connor’s saddle bags. Go over there and just give it a little loosen; it’ll be funny cause it could just fall off and he’d lose his stuff.Spurrier (as Randy): [Sarcastically] So convenient.Kyle (as Eddie): So? Whatdya think? It's no harming anybody.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, what’s in them?Kyle (as Eddie): I dunno, but he won’t have it. It'll be pretty funny though, right?Spurrier (as Randy): [Struggling] Oh..wha..Kyle (as Eddie): [Cheerfully] Come on, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): [Struggling] No..no-Kyle (as Eddie): [Cheerfully] Come on, Randy!Spurrier (as Randy): No, no, no-Kyle: Go ahead and give me that wisdom save throw!Spurrier: I don’t add anything, I don’t even have to look- [rolls dice] It’s always on these rolls! Two.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Oh no.Spurrier: It’s totally legit, these are always my worst rolls-Kyle: They’re hard to do-Goodrich: It’s not really Eddie, it’s Kyle that makes you roll.Kyle & Spurrier: That’s true.Kyle: All I need you to do is give me a slight of hand check.Spurrier: Okay, this I’ll get a twenty on.[Other players chuckle, dice rolls]Kyle: I know what you’re good at.Spurrier: It’s a seven plus nine.Kyle: Okay so, you start sneaking over there to do Eddie’s little deed and uh, Connor notices you and says-Kyle (as Connor): Hey! What are you doing over there little guy!?Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, checking your supplies, making sure we’re all stocked and ready to go!Kyle: Roll me a deception check!Spurrier: [Softly] ‘Kay.Goodrich: Why are you picking on Spurrier so much!?[All laugh]Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is a seventeen plus six. Goodrich: Phew.Kyle: Okay, and he looks at you and he kind of like, squints and eyes you up and down a little bit and says-Kyle (as Connor): Thanks, I guess.Spurrier (as Randy): You got everything you need? Snacks?Kyle (as Connor): [Slowly] Yeah. Oh-Kyle: And he walks over to John and he says-Kyle (as Connor): John, do we have snacks ready?Spurrier: And I just mosey away.Kyle: Okay!Spurrier: Back to my sanda-nista.[All laugh]Goodrich: Do we have the deluxe ones? This is the LX!Spurrier: LX2000.Kyle: That’s right.Spurrier: Yes.Goodrich: Sandatee Turbo.Spurrier: Oh man.Kyle: [With English accent] You can lease one for two thirty-nine a month. [Normal] Alright so, you get all packed up, you get all ready to go, you’re able to get in a little bit of mischief but eventually you make your way off into the southern dessert.Goodrich: Well while we’re traveling can I talk to Randy? Is that cool for me to do?Kyle: Absolutely.Goodrich: Okay, I just wanted to ask Randy-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, how’s Eddie doing? Has he been causing any more problems? Been flaring up ever since your little- the little crook on your back- has your Eddie been-Spurrier: I mean-Kyle: You have some preparation E?[All laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): I uh, made that kid blind so-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I'm thinking if it’s cool with you maybe whenever we stop we talk to Splash about it? Just because we were going to this morning and then we got all-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, that’s fine, just probably not while we’re flopping across the desert.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeaah, yeaah [Laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): [Laughing] Just wait.Goodrich: Is that how these things move, Kyle? They flop?Kyle: Yeah, they flop really well though!Goodrich: Yeah, right, right, right. Okay.Kyle: So, alright that’s you two having a little chat uh, Yashee you doing anything?Ali: Um, yeah so I guess while all that’s been going on I've been kind of riding off to the side with my sandatee.Kyle: Mhm.Ali: And I’ve been kind of talking to it, trying to get to know it a little bit-[Others laugh]Ali: Rubbing it’s neck a lot, like talking to it about what we’ve been up to so-Goodrich: Have you given it a name? Do you want me to talk to it!?Ali: Well, so I was going to um, cast animal friendships.Goodrich: Aww!Spurrier: Nice!Ali: To make sure my sandatee knows that like, I care about her.Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: Okay yeah- aww, that’s so cute, yes!Ali: Yeah! Just so you know we can have like a nice ride together.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely.Ali: We’ll leave like, a little closer.[Players chuckle]Kyle: That’s adorable, yes, I love it.Ali: Okay! So, I’ll start um, tapping out some beats on my leg while like, riding my sandatee.Goodrich: You’re like, beating your sandatee with your mallets?Ali: Yeah, well I didn’t wanna do that so I'll hit myself you know? I’ve got some strong knees.Goodrich: Right, yeah yeah.[Low drum beat begins]Ali (singing): Animal friendship is rare; do you know what I'm sayin’? Animal friendship is rare. It's rare to me, can’t you see? It’s rare to me and my sandatee.[Music stops]Kyle: Okay so you perform your song and your sandatee’s going along just fine and you start to play and it looks back at you, and just gives you like these big like, open eyes like, I love you so much![All laugh]Kyle: I can’t even- normally there’s a roll involved with this but you know, these are trained beasts so uh-Ali: Right, well my song was out of love anyway.Kyle: Absolutely, and it felt that love very hardcore. It's kind of adjusted it’s gate to where it’s not jostling you around as much-Ali: Aw!Kyle: It’s making sure it’s flippers don’t fling sand back on you too much, it’s actually starting to take a little bit of a swerve as it feels like it’s sort of dancing across the sand now cause it’s so happy!Ali: I go- “Oh, Sandy!” Cause I named it Sandy-[All laugh]Kyle: Yes!Ali: I do have to ask actually, what color is my sandatee?Kyle: Most of them- most of them are gray.Ali: Gray- oh I was hoping she was going to be a pink lady-[All laugh]Kyle: She’s pink from blushing.Ali: My little pink lady, Sandy!Kyle: Yeah!Ali: Oh, Sandy!Goodrich: Did we name our sandatee?Spurrier: I mean, we can.Kyle: No, you’re too busy talking to each other-[Players laugh]Goodrich: Okay, fine-Kyle: Do you wanna try to name your sandatee real quick?Goodrich: No.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: Do you?Spurrier: Randatee the sandatee.[All laugh]Ali: There you go.Goodrich: Randatee? Have you just named it that yourself and didn’t tell me?Spurrier: Yeah!Goodrich: You whisper to it- oh yeah cause you’re right up in the front.Spurrier: I’m in the front so I lean down to it’s ear and go-Spurrier (as Randy): [Whispering] You’re Randatee now.[All laugh]Kyle: It looks back at you, it like rolls it’s head back like- “whaaaat?”Goodrich: Meanwhile I’m just getting sand sprayed on me.Kyle: Yeah! Oh, speaking of sand sprayed on you-Goodrich: [Laughs] Oh no!Kyle: After all this has gone down you’ve actually notice that there is a sandstorm heading in your direction. You see everybody else in the party, they start to you know, kinda pull up a scarf, adjust themselves to prepare for it.Goodrich: Yeah, I just pull down my goggles, spray paint my mouth silver and go- [Yelling] Yes! I’m going to ride eternal![All laugh]Kyle: Alright, anybody else?Spurrier: Oh man.Ali: Um, I don’t think I have anything that I can pull over my-Spurrier: Since I'm not- cause you’re kind of driving right? Cause I'm talking to Randatee.Goodrich: I just said what I was doing.Spurrier: I know-Goodrich: I rip off all my clothes-Spurrier: Did you-Goodrich: And I’m going to ride eternal-Spurrier: Definitely driving. Good.[Kyle laughs]Kyle: He took over, pushed him to the side-Spurrier: In that cause I’m just going to tie Joby to my face.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Over all my holes and openings.Ali: I’m just gonna like, crouch onto Sandy like, really lay on her and put my arms around her neck.Kyle: Okay.Ali: But not like, too tight. Don’t want to hurt her.Kyle: Gotcha, so yeah, you all prepare yourselves and brace yourselves as best as some can. It takes a good while to get through this sandstorm and it’s starting to get later in the day. It’s definitely slowed your progress but the sandatees are still going through it strong. I'm gonna say you’ve taken proper precautions to not suffer any negative effects of this sandstorm.Goodrich: I have like, ungodly charisma points. [Chuckles] So that’s what protects me.Kyle: That’s right, so you get through the sandstorm just fine. Everything's great and it’s getting towards dusk as the day rolls on. And you can start to see the glowing admitting from the south, and you’re probably just one hill away from being where you need to be. And sure enough, you cress that final dune and you look down and the desert gives way to a patch of more rocky surface compared to the sand that you’ve been traveling over. But you’ve reached this point in the Stri desert and you can see the glow stones that are littered about. In the center of this area in a much larger boulder that’s just beaming bright in comparison to the other ones but on the far side of this area you notice there’s two people that are, you know, they’re the two people that went ahead of you. And you can see they’re standing in the middle of almost half set up kind of camp, and there is a ridge of dirt that is behind that camp. You can see it goes in a good circle; you see a circle around but you can’t quite see inside of it because of the height of the ridge. So, as you make an approach to the small camp that’s set up you can see that it’s Layla and Jermaine. Layla waves, begins to walk towards as Jermaine continues to set things up. She looks at John specifically and, you can all hear her, she’s saying it pretty loudly, she’s like-Kyle (as Layla): We seem to have a real problem. Go ahead and ride over, let’s take a look at this and I’ll explain it.Goodrich: Is she on a sandatee?Kyle: No she’s walking, but you can all ride your sandatees over and everything-Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So yeah, everybody makes their way up to the ridge and looks over and of course, this is the crater where the meteor landed. And Layla immediately says-Kyle (as Layla): So, I imagine you can see the problem?Ali: It’s a bunch of meatballs.Kyle: It’s a bunch of meatballs![All laugh]Kyle: How’d you know!?Ali: I just- I knew it was coming back!Kyle: [Laughs] No, at the center of this crater is a hole and it just goes down, and down, and down into dark.Goodrich: [Concerned] Oh.Kyle: She turns back, she says-Kyle (as Layla): This must have penetrated the crust of- of our planet and I don’t know how far down it is, and I don’t think meteors typically do that.Spurrier (as Randy): Right..Kyle: And uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh uh..Kyle: And John turns to everyone and is just like-Kyle (as John): Alright, we’ve gotten here, let’s just go ahead and finish setting up camp. Rest. We’re gonna check this out tomorrow, see what we can do.Kyle: And I think we might end it there for now.Goodrich: Alright.Ali: Hmm.[Soft music plays and fades out]-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone @peachdoodles – Twitter"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-15-the-ss-chaos-sauce,Ep. 15 – The S.S. Chaos Sauce,"Ep. 15 – The S.S. Chaos Sauce[Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed, thanks for joining us again! Let’s recap episode fourteen real quick for ya. So, our bards went and helped Erin with the Pell brothers get over their little nightmare problems that they’re having. In the process we had a little bit of Eddie mischief, but eventually you bards were able to help out the dream boys and incept some tactics to fight this nightmare. However, in the process Jenny, the figure in the dream, realized it was not just these dream boys in the dream-[Players chuckling]Kyle: And that’s when it ended. So uh-Goodrich: Some dream bards too, Kyle.Kyle: Yeah, a little dream bards, dream boys. But you were successful in the end and you- you know, you left the boys sleeping soundly. So, you left the Pell house and made your way back to meet up with the rest of the group at the Oasis. Ya’ll went and packed up your sandatees with a nearly fun foible with Eddie. Then you headed out towards the impact site towards the glow fields.Goodrich: I mean, you gotta have fun too, Kyle-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: We get it-Kyle: Yeah-[Overlapping conversation]Kyle: You know I gotta have my fun times.[All chuckle]Kyle: So, on the way, Randy and Raz’ul discussed his uh, “Eddie flareups” as Raz’ul put it. That was all while Yashee was getting more acquainted with her sandatee, Sandy. So, you faired through a sandstorm alright and eventually arrived at the Glow Field; and this is where you met back up with Layla and the assistant Jermaine. And Layla let the group know it’s not quite what everyone expected, and we ended last episode with John telling everyone to get the camp set up and that it was going to be further inspected in the morning. So, let’s go ahead and pick up there.Goodrich: Alrighty!Kyle: So, everybody has split off to do their specific jobs in preparing the camp and I'm assuming you three set up your tent or tents during this time? Unless you’re going to do something else?Goodrich: Can we make like, a little igloo situation where we connect them and make a little-Spurrier: I was about to say, we can have little like, tunnels- yeah.[Players excitedly agree]Ali: As long as I can fit through it, I’m fine. [Laughs] I’m like, army crawling through like, “come on guys!”Kyle: [Imitating Yashee] You made this difficult.[Ali laughs]Kyle: As you’re setting up your equipment you three start getting this eerie feeling that you’re being watched by something? It’s as if someone's right behind you.Goodrich: I turn around! [Yells]Kyle: Okay, you look around-[All laugh]Kyle: And you notice that some of the others are looking the same way. They're looking over their shoulders suddenly from time to time. And as you’re looking at the others you turn back to your gear and Jermaine is standing there holding a stack of books, and he looks at you three and he says-Kyle (as Jermaine): [With a cockney-English accent] Hey uh, you’re those bards from Strumlotts, eh?[Goodrich and Spurrier confirm together]Kyle (as Jermaine): Okay so I- ya'll played anywhere? Anywhere I might know?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Questioning] The Punch Bowl? Back in-Spurrier (as Randy): Lakeridge?Kyle (as Jermaine): Ah, okay I've been through their once. Saw it on my way into Sundance when I was first travelin’ in from my squiring. Cool, cool-Kyle: And as he’s saying this, his arms start to shift a bit and his grasp on the books kind of falters and he starts losing balance of the books.Goodrich: I go- I run over to help him-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa there, fella!Kyle: Alright, give me a dex check real quick.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] It’s an eleven, plus one for jack of all trades, twelve.Kyle: Excellent. So yeah, you get over there and it’s pretty easy to help him balance the books. But you know, as you’re doing so like, you catch a couple of them-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Grunting] I got it!Kyle: You see he has a pretty big bandage on his like, forearm.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: He catches the books and he’s like-Kyle (as Jermaine): Oh, thanks- thanks for the help there, man-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah-Kyle (as Jermaine): I appreciate that-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Grunting] Yeah, just lemme get that-Goodrich: Yashee- can I ask Yashee to put this on the stack of books?Kyle: It’s a pretty tall stack.Ali: Sure!Goodrich: Okay-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Here, can you put this back up there?Ali (as Yashee): M’yeah, I guess.Goodrich (as Raz’lu): Thanks.Ali: I’ll just drop it all- boop.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Jermaine): I appreciate that ya’ll. Most people don’t help me with my books but that’s- that’s okay. Um-[Players laugh]Kyle (as Jermaine): Thanks for the help!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No prob!Kyle (as Jermaine): Cool-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, what's your deal man? Like, what do you do around here? [Chuckles][Players burst into laughter]Kyle (as Jermaine): Oh, I'm actually- I fetch books for Layla and Japhine(?) in this adventure at least.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay.Kyle (as Jermaine): If they need to reference something and go back to it, I go and grab them the book- which, uh, speaking of which I should probably get going. I’ve probably left them waitin’ too long.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Before you go.Kyle (as Jermaine): Yeah?Spurrier (as Randy): What’s up with your arm, if you don’t mind me asking?Kyle (as Jermaine): [Quickly] Oh! That um, it’s uh, it’s an injury from dropping my books.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh!Kyle (as Jermaine): Uh- yeah! The corner of one came down and really got me good on there.Spurrier (as Randy): [Suspicious] That’s a pretty impressive book dropping.Spurrier: I’m gonna roll an insight check.Ali: Like a really good papercut.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is a fourteen plus three.Kyle: You can tell he’s not being truthful.Spurrier (as Randy): Jermaine, right?Kyle (as Jermaine): Yeah?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah? Could you just chill for one second before you take your books back?Kyle (as Jermaine): Well actually- I think I hear Japhine and Layla calling me now. I- I gotta go, I’ll talk to ya’ll later.Spurrier: And I pull up my shirt and uh, Eddie comes out and I'm gonna cast mage hand and grab him by the uh, ankle.Kyle: [Laughing] Okay.Spurrier: And I say-Spurrier (as Randy): [Distorted] Mage Hand!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What are you doing!?Spurrier: So, then Eddie comes out and he’s gonna grab him by the ankle.Kyle: Okay, so I'm gonna say- I'm gonna roll against your spell save DC for this. Just his dexterity check just to see if he gets it. [Rolls dice] And uh yeah, Eddie goes out to try to grab his ankle but- man, Jermaine’s pretty quick and he slips right through his grasp.Spurrier (as Randy): Guys, let’s go!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): W-what?Spurrier (as Randy): He’s a lying fool!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Lying about what, dude? Chill.Spurrier (as Randy): His arm, his bandage.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, I mean, that’s okay. Maybe he got hurt doing something stupid or he’s covering up a tattoo he’s having removed or something, I dunno.Spurrier (as Randy): He’s a fidgety little feller. [Determined] We’re gonna get him.Ali (as Yashee): We’re all entitled to our secrets man, I mean-[Overlapping conversation and laughter]Spurrier (as Randy): I’m gonna go after him. You can help me or not. This guy is not. On. The. Level.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, I'm pretty pooped man. If you want to run after him that’s cool-Spurrier: At this point he’s getting away, so I'm running away from you guys-[All laugh]Kyle: Okay so, Randy, you follow Jermaine and you leads you back to where Jaffney and Layla are. And these two are sitting at a table pouring over scrolls and tomes. And they seem to be almost in sync as they swap text then exclaim to each other like, “Oh!” as they swap these things.Goodrich: They finish each other's..Kyle: Sandwiches?[All laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] Yes!Kyle: So yeah, they’re passing these books back and forth and Jaffney looks up as Jermaine approaches and says-Kyle (as Jaffney): [Elegent voice] Oh Jermaine, good. I need you to bring me Astronomical Anomalies of Alkin please. Kyle: And Jermaine’s like-Kyle (as Jermaine): Yeah, not a problem.Kyle: And starts getting the book.Spurrier: Alright, let’s see here. I guess I'm just gonna hide and just wait and see if anything happens.Kyle: Mkay, you gonna browse the scene?Spurrier: [Rolls dice] Okay, that is a five plus nine.Kyle: Mkay, where- where are you hiding? You gonna- how are you gonna hide?Spurrier: It’s nighttime right?Kyle: Yeah, it’s dusk- there’s all these glow stones around so it’s luminated.Spurrier: What’s around? Like, are they at their tent?Kyle: Yeah, there’s a tent nearby. You know, you could hide behind a barrel.Spurrier: Yeah- Oh! Barrel, yes, classic.[All laugh]Kyle: So-Goodrich: Wait, are you hiding behind the barrel or in it?Spurrier: In it.Goodrich: Walk it across if you need to.Spurrier: Yeah!Kyle: Yeah you know, you can Metal Gear that.Spurrier: Yeah, exactly.Kyle: Yup, so I'm gonna say you’re hiding in this barrel and you’ve got your head poked up just a little bit so you can see and hear-Goodrich: Is there a knot hole he can just look through?Kyle: No there’s “knot.”Goodrich: Aww.Spurrier: Darn.Goodrich: Sorry.Kyle: You can try. So, you’re hiding in the barrel and you have your head poked up a little bit and Jaffney just looks right over to you and says-Kyle (as Jaffney): You’re the littlest bard that’s with us, right?[Goodrich laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): I am.Kyle (as Jaffney): What are you doing in that barrel?Spurrier (as Randy): ..Looking.[Goodrich chuckles]Kyle (as Jaffney): For what?Spurrier (as Randy): Um..Goodrich: Yourself.Spurrier (as Randy): Solace, yeah.[Players trying not to laugh]Kyle (as Jaffney): Solace?Spurrier (as Randy): Yes, I needed to get away. Needed to rest up a little. This was uh..isolated.Kyle (as Jaffney): Oh-Spurrier (as Randy): Sorry if it looked like I was spying. I was just kind of taking in the surroundings, I've never been this far out in the desert.Kyle (as Jaffney): That’s okay. Uh, you’ve never been out in the Strei before?Spurrier (as Randy): Mm-mm.Kyle (as Jaffney): Okay well uh, you don’t- you’re being kind of weird.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s part of the course.Kyle (as Jaffney): Uh, alright Randy.Kyle: And Jermaine brings back a book and hands it to her, and she takes it from him and says-Kyle (as Jaffney): Thank you, Jermaine.Kyle: Waves her hand over it and opens it and she just starts reading and she’s like-Kyle (as Jaffney): Enjoy your barrel, I guess?Spurrier (as Randy): Thanks!Spurrier: [Defeated] Alright well, I'm gonna go back and just pass along-Spurrier (as Randy): Okay-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, what’s up dude?Spurrier (as Randy): I found out a whole lot of nothing, but there’s something weird about this Jermaine guy!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, okay-Spurrier (as Randy): We just need to uh-Ali (as Yashee): Keep our eyes open-Spurrier (as Randy): Keep an eye on him!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He seemed like a good dude to me but you know-Spurrier (as Randy): Also, there’s a nice barrel if you guys need some time to yourself.[Kyle bursts out laughing]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay! Just letting you know.Ali (as Yashee): I’ll think about it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe, I dunno.Kyle: Alright, so you finish setting up your little corner of the camp and around the same time as this you notice everybody’s broken off into three different groups. You’ve got Boom Queen, Whimpy and Big Shot- they're hanging around the fire-Goodrich: You mean, Erin.Kyle: I mean it’s- it’s one of those names that started off as like, “yeah you’re a big shot.” And then all the sudden it became a double meaning-Goodrich: Oooh!Spurrier: Well, well.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Clever turnups.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: One-point o’s back, great.[All chuckling]Kyle: So yeah, Boom Queen, Whimpy and Big Shot are all hanging around the fire chowing down, sounding quite jovial. John, Connor and Symbol [softly] dressed up as Luey, [normal] are all hanging around a table outside of a tent and they’re looking over something on the table-Goodrich: Did you just say John Connor and Symbol?Ali: He did.Kyle: Yeah, I did.[Players chuckling]Goodrich: Perfect.Kyle: I know- I know what I'm doing.Spurrier: Okay!Kyle: Believe you, me- I know what I'm doing.Spurrier: [Softly] I’m gonna write that down, John Connor’s here.[Soft laughter]Kyle: So- and of course Layla and Jaffney are still sitting at their table reading through scrolls and whatnot. Jermaine getting them a book here and there. So but, you three are standing around looking at these groups. What do?Goodrich: Well, I wanna talk to Symbol about Eddie, especially after that little exchange; and I turn to Randy and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, you think maybe now would be a good time to talk to Splash about Eddie? Especially after we helped the dude with his books and then- did you let Eddie come out and try to trip him or was that-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, no, that was me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay-Spurrier (as Randy): I gave that guy a good looking over and somethings..off. Right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well-Spurrier (as Randy): Something’s a little weird about that guy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well the line as to whether or not it’s you-Spurrier (as Randy): Well I've told you guys so far now when it’s been him ever since-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I- I-Spurrier (as Randy): Old fingerless- non-Fingerbones all went down.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well regardless, the line for me- I don’t know about you Yashee, but the line for me is starting to get a little blurry with whether or not it’s you- in the moment, right? You know what I'm sayin’-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Like, whenever Eddie pops out- is this Randy controlling Eddie? Is this Eddie controlling Eddie? It’s just kind of getting a little hard to-Ali (as Yashee): Hard to know-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Discern.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, I mean yeah-Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s go chat it up, let’s see if we can get him away from the pack.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes, how do we want to do that?Ali (as Yashee): I’m gonna throw-Spurrier (as Randy): We could just go ask him-Ali (as Yashee): I’m gonna throw a spoon at him.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali: I’m gonna find like a nice uh, I don’t know, one that I think it’s aim will be true.[All chuckling]Kyle: [Amused] Okay.Ali: Pull out a nice skinny one- [Whoosh] right over there, just not too hard.Kyle: Yeah, yeah, no, I feel ya.[Ali laughs]Kyle: Roll me a dexterity check.[Players chuckling]Ali: Uh, okay.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: [Rolls dice] It’s a twenty.[Players laugh]Kyle: Oh my gosh.Ali: Nineteen plus one.Kyle: So, you throw this spoon and it lands right on the table [metal clanks on surface]Goodrich: [Laughing] Right next to a plate!Kyle: Yeah! Right next to where ever these three are looking at on this table. And they all kind of look up and they look in the direction the spoon came from.Goodrich: And we’re just waving-Ali: Just waving, yeah.Kyle: Yeah, and John kind of looks at Connor and then looks at Symbol dressed up as Luey; gestures his head in your direction.Ali: I’m gonna say-Ali (as Yashee): Hey Luey, can you bring me my spoon? It got away from me somehow.[Others burst into laughter]Ali (as Yashee): Do you mind bringing that over here?Kyle: Symbol, as Luey, grabs it and says-Kyle (as Symbol): [New York accent] Yeah, you must have been up to some real spoonin’ over there to lose it this far.Ali (as Yashee): Just- yeah, I dunno. [Laughs] I was really getting into it.Kyle: You see him turn and say, “I’ll be right back.” and heads over and comes up to you three; looks behind him for a second, looks over his shoulder and says-Kyle (as Symbol): [Without accent] Okay, so uh, real quick, your assignments due.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Kyle: He holds out his hand.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What assignment? What are you talking about? We're on an assignment here with you, prof.Spurrier (as Randy): Yees.[Ali laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We didn’t get- what are you talking about? We’re here with you.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, no-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I thought we were kind of on a break from school.Kyle (as Symbol): No, I gave you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Mumbling]Kyle (as Symbol): I gave you a scroll to get signed.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [With realization] Ooh!Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, yeah yeah yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we- Randy you got that, right?Spurrier (as Randy): Yup! Yup, yup, yup, yup, let’s make sure it looks good. Just lemme skim through this again..reading it well..[Players chuckling]Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, looks good! There you go- [grunts]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wow, get everything you need out of that, bud?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah! I was just skimming it again to make sure it was all- that it was all signed and dotted and T’s and I’s.Goodrich: Wait, does Randy know what T’s and I’s are?[Ali’s bursts into laughter]Spurrier: He’s heard the saying.Goodrich: [Laughing] Okay.Spurrier: He doesn’t know what it means but.Goodrich: It’s something you say around the context of reading.Spurrier: Yeah!Goodrich: Got it.Kyle: You know, minding your P’s and Q’s.Goodrich: Right, yeah.Ali: I was hoping he would have handed you like, the wrong scroll.[All laugh]Ali: Like after all that checking he did it’s like, “Dude, this is like your math homework.”[Laughter continues]Spurrier: Just Randy’s drawings.Kyle: So, Symbol inspects the scrolls; looks at it, looks at you three and goes-Kyle: (as Symbol): Okay..Kyle: Pulls out a book and opens it up, begins muttering as he’s writing he says-Kyle (as Symbol): [Mumbling] Assignment three? Yeah..[Players laughing]Kyle: He takes a beat, looks and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay..Kyle: Looks at you three again.Goodrich: We’re all grinning at him like- ehhhh, did a good job?Kyle (as Symbol): Your song, major or minor?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Major.Spurrier (as Randy): Major- no, minor!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, crap! Yeah!Spurrier (as Randy): It was minor!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It was minor, it was minor!Kyle (as Symbol): Minor?Spurrier (as Randy): With Fingerbones.Ali (as Yashee): Fingerbones-Spurrier (as Randy): We had to cater to the feeling of the bar; everyone was sad so we made it minor.Kyle (as Symbol): Oh perfect, excellent, okay.Goodrich: Nice!Kyle: And he snaps his book closed and tucks it away.Spurrier: Yes!Goodrich: Nailed it!Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, strict teacher time done. How did your uh, ride through the desert treat you? How was your sandatee?Spurrier (as Randy): It was good.Ali (as Yashee): Mine was very pleasant, I made a friend.Kyle (as Symbol): You made a friend? That's good.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I got to ride historic on the Basom road. That was pretty brutal.Kyle (as Symbol): I saw you back there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, it was awesome!Spurrier (as Randy): I pretended like I was part of a ship.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Also, you remember back when we were on the way here? We kind of talked about Eddie?Goodrich: I kinda- I put my arm around Randy, kinda bring him in closer.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Talked about Eddie a little bit and we maybe were going to keep an eye on things? Well, it’s been kind of acting a little weird- Eddie that is, not Randy-Spurrier (as Randy): Well-[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Potato, pot-a-to. Um so, do you know- we've got this-Goodrich: And I start turning you around.Spurrier: Oh! [Laughs]Kyle (as Symbol): Oh yeah, you said something about a back-Ali: I pull up his shirt, pull it right up.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, we’ve got this happening also now. Do you know what this means?Kyle: You lift up Randy’s shirt- I imagine- Randy, you let this happen?Spurrier: Oh, yeah! It’s fine![All laugh]Kyle: Okay-Spurrier: My shirt comes up at least a couple times an episode.Kyle: So yeah- it wouldn’t be Bombarded if it didn’t. Okay so, you lift up Randy’s shirt and Symbol immediately busts out a journal and just starts copying down the image and drawing what he sees. And as he’s looking over he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): That one right there.Kyle: And he points to a specific rune and he says-Kyle (as Symbol): This one uh, this one is a clerical rune and it’s used by worshipers of Modulus, the God of Transformation.Goodrich: [Chuckles] Okay.Spurrier: Oh!Kyle (as Symbol): And-Goodrich: Not the gods of modulation?Kyle: No.Goodrich: [Laughs] Okay!Kyle: Transformation.Goodrich: I see, I’m smelling what you’re stepping in, it’s cool.Kyle: Picking up what I'm putting down?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And Randy, whenever he says this you remember something of your time with the Nowhere Man. You remember a man named Doctor The Patient and he would talk about Modulus from time to time. You know, the many glories of Modulus and what Modulus provides as far as being able to transform the world, and also just minor things. It's very- it's very much in the realm of uh, transmutational magic.Spurrier: Okay, do I get much out of this- like, was this something he talked to me about often-Kyle: No-Spurrier: Was it just something that kind of came up?Kyle: It was just- it was a characteristic of his to talk about this god and he seemed very forward about it. So, yeah!Goodrich: It’s like learning about atonal music. You hear about it but you know, never really screw around with it.[Kyle laughs]Goodrich: Unless you’re Kyle!Kyle: Yeah, that’s true.[Overlapping conversation]Spurrier (as Randy): Wait, Splash what was that name again?Kyle (as Symbol): Uh, Modulus.Spurrier (as Randy): [Softly] Modulus.. [Normal] Okay, I don’t know if this matters really but, one of the Nowhere Man, Doctor the..Patient- yeah, he would talk about this guy a lot. He was super emphatic about how delightful he is.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay..Spurrier (as Randy): So, not sure if that’s helpful but um, kind of weird. I haven’t thought about that in I don’t even know how long.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Also, there’s this crack.Goodrich: And I point to the crack.Spurrier (as Randy): You can stick your finger in it.Kyle (as Symbol): I-Ali (as Yashee): We all did![Players chuckle]Kyle: He tries, and uh, Yashee and Raz’ul, as you point out the crack you notice that it’s a little bit bigger than it was last time. Goodrich: Oh boy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It was smaller, uh-Ali (as Yashee): We could only stick one finger in it at a time.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, and also, it’s kinda hard on the inside? We don’t know what’s going on, man. I don’t- I- did just-Kyle (as Symbol): Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you know what’s going on and Eddie seems to be acting a little bit crazier than usual? I don’t know if it’s the proximity to these glowy stones or what the deal is.Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I wouldn’t know myself but if you know somebody who followed Modulus I mean, perhaps they would be able to shed some light on this.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But they’re a Nowhere Man…the last Nowhere Man we met tried to kills us.Spurrier (as Randy): I was gonna say, seeking them out might be a little..Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, it’s a real bummer you seem to be at ends with them.Spurrier (as Randy): [Chuckles] Just a little, yeah. I mean, you guys are pretty privy to this at this point so I guess I can probably say- this might be kind of obvious. Eddie’s the reason why the Nowhere Men and I are at ends- or the Nowhere Man I should say, it’s plural as well.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Why do they want Eddie? He seems to just be causing problems.Spurrier (as Randy): Right, right, well- [sighs] Alright, since it’s just all of us and we’re out in the middle of nowhere, and it’s nighttime, I'm just gonna put the basics out there. So, I mean, you guys know I was in league with them, with the Nowhere Man, I was-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wait so, are you a Nowhere Man?Spurrier (as Randy): I was working on it.[Players react in shock and also confirmation]Spurrier (as Randy): I never quite made it to that level, but I have a lot of training and such from them. And Eddie was something they had, Eddie’s essentially a gem- I presume there’s something in the gem. And so, one day I was by it and you guys know how he’s kind of calling out to me now, he called out to me then, and since I've never been around this is just instantly happened. Uh, I just took it and he was telling me to eat him-[All laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): And I did! And it was that and afterwards I kind of realized what happened and I was like, “ooh,” and I realized the severity of it. I didn’t leave them until a little bit later but it wasn’t too long after that.Goodrich: So, what you’re saying is you never learned how to read?[All laugh]Spurrier: Exactly!Goodrich: Just kidding, no!Ali: There was a sign right next to him that’s like, “Don’t eat me.”[Laughter continues]Spurrier: There was Randy’s downfall.Kyle: You had to be there to know.Goodrich: Yeah!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, that sucks!Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, well, I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): For you- so, you’re saying you weren’t in control of yourself you just kinda-Spurrier (as Randy): Well, right-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Reached out and grabbed out and grabbed it.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, it was basically an overwhelming power and force and I was like “Oh, eat me? Okay!”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He was like, [singing] Randy, reach out and touch me! And you ate him.Spurrier (as Randy): And I did!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, uh-Kyle (as Symbol): You ate a gem!?Spurrier (as Randy): [Pauses] Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, is it still in your tummy? Is it like swallowing gum where it stays in your tummy for seven years? Or will this gem just naturally pass?[Ali starts laughing]Spurrier (as Randy): I-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Should we start checking your droppings?Spurrier (as Randy): Not yet![All laughing]Kyle: Squeeze it out of him!Goodrich: Yeah!Spurrier: I mean, you’re certainly free to try.[Laughter continues]Spurrier (as Randy): It’s been- [pauses] over twenty years since this happened and-Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s still there? I mean, that’s why I can cast those other spells. I mean, you guys have seen it plenty of times now, I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe that’s why you couldn’t handle that spicy food.[All chuckle]Goodrich: I don’t know, is there like fantasy ipecac we could give him and see if he barfs it up?[Someone snickers]Spurrier: I mean, I'll say-Goodrich: We gotta get that out of you!Spurrier (as Randy): In my adventures I've certainly thrown up a time or two. I don’t think that’s going to be a solution- I don’t think either end is going to be a means.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): In its natural biological halfling functions.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Splash? You got any-Kyle (as Symbol): [Mumbles] Symbol.Spurrier (as Randy): I’ve laid it all out there, I’ve- I’ve- I don’t know what else to say at this point.Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, well thanks.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah- I mean, I know I've- again, as you have seen how dangerous these guys are. That’s why I was keeping all this secret. I mean, now that you’re privy to it- not that you’re guilty by association, but might as well be.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Kind of.Kyle (as Symbol): Kind- yeah, I say kind of. We took two of their fingers technically.Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, at this point especially but even just being associated with me-Ali (as Yashee): I’ll give them back if they want ‘em-[All laugh]Ali (as Yashee): I mean I've got ‘em zip locked; keepin’ ‘em fresh.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, maybe that doctor guy can do something about it.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, exactly!Kyle (as Symbol): I don’t know, I guess if you come across one of the Nowhere Man you might want to think about how you approach the next situation.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah [sighs] yeah, I guess if you guys can just check my back maybe once a day from this point, we can keep an eye on the crack.[Players agree]Spurrier (as Randy): Cause again, I don’t feel anything.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we’ll just keep an eye on it.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, I don’t really know what else there is to do. I mean, Splash do you know of any remedies?Kyle (as Symbol): It’s Symbol, but no I can’t really think of anything. Again, it seems like an amuse bouche of different runes and sigils.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee) I wonder if uh, Jermaine has any books on the topic of uh..Modulus?Spurrier (as Randy): Modulus? Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): You could check-Ali (as Yashee): He has like a whole library in one bag, it’s great.Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe if you guys wanna go ask?[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, I guess. Yashee, let’s go check it out.Ali (as Yashee): Okay!Goodrich: Kyle, who’s all over by Jermaine?Kyle: It’s Jaffney and Layla.Goodrich: Okay.Spurrier: And as you guys are walking away I just call out-Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, remember! He’s sneaky!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Riiight.Spurrier (as Randy): He’s a liar!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Keep an eye out!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Got it, thanks! Bye!Spurrier (as Randy): Bye!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye Randy and Splash!Kyle (as Symbol): [Softly] It’s Symbol![All laugh]Goodrich: So, I turn to you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, can you walk and talk?Ali (as Yashee): [Laughs] I think I can manage that, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Chuckles] Okay-Goodrich: So, as we’re walking-Ali (as Yashee): [Softly] Right, left, right, left.Goodrich: right, left, right, left [chuckles] So, as we’re walking over, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, maybe I can transform into an animal and maybe go and sneak a book away from him instead of just [pauses] walking up in there.Ali (as Yashee): Sure! I’ll distract him [pauses] somehow.[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well okay, if you’re gonna distract him, Yashee then why don’t we kind of split around? Kinda go around both sides and you can try to distract him and I'll sneak up where the books are.Kyle: Mm, clever girl.Goodrich: Clever girl, exactly! Just like the velociraptors!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I'll transform while I'm over there on the other side of the ridge-Goodrich: I don’t know, what’s the setting like on the other side of their tent?Kyle: Oh, well yeah, from the way you’re looking at it- they're in the middle between two tents. They have a table set up; little bit of an overhang set up over them and Jermaine is basically standing behind the table that they’re sitting at standing next to a back pack that has books just piling out of it. Goodrich: Okay, so I turn to you Yashee and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You got it?Ali (as Yashee): [Hesitant] Y-yeah, yeah-Ali & Goodrich: Ready? Break! [Clap][All chuckle]Ali: I’ll head around.Goodrich: Okay, and I’m gonna roll for what animal I get. [Rolls dice]Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: So, fifty-two is a [laughing] black bear.Kyle: Great!Spurrier: Perfect!Kyle: Fits right in.Goodrich: Not super, so I guess uh, do I keep this roll or do I go for my second one? Ehhh-[Overlapping conversation about changing animals]Goodrich: I still have to transform I so I do I go- [Groaning and voice becomes deeper] and I'm a black bear.Kyle: Red cheeked black bear returns.Goodrich: [Deep voice] Yeah, I don’t think this is gonna work and I say-Goodrich: (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice slowly returns back to normal] Stupid Raz’ul, stupid raz’ul-Goodrich: And I’m hitting myself in the head as a black bear, I can’t get it right! So alright, I'm gonna roll again and this is what I go with. [Shakes dice and rolls it] It’s fifty-four, wow. Which is [laughs] a brown bear![All burst into laughter]Spurrier: Isn’t that even bigger?Goodrich: Yeah, a little bit.Goodrich: So, I go again-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Groaning and voice becomes deeper] And I’m a brown bear- brown bear!? Damnit, Raz’ul! Ah!Kyle: So, you transform into a black bear, and I imagine you sitting on your back with your legs out with your legs out in front of you. You know, you’re hitting yourself and you’re like, “come on, you can do this!”Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle: And then, you just go a little bit bigger and your fur turns brown![All laughing]Kyle: And you’re sitting there and you just look at your hands and you’re like-Goodrich: [Disappointed] Aw..Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Or I guess I'd be- [Deep voice, disappointed] Aw..Ali: Well, I have walked to the other side of them. Um, is just Jermaine kind of aware and looking? Or the other two have their nose in a book or?Kyle: Yeah, Jermaine is looking through some of the books that he has on the ground around him.Ali: I’m probably going to distract all three of them, right?Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Uh okay, so I'm gonna take out a couple spoons and just say uh-Ali (as Yashee): Hey guys! Nice to finally meet you and hang out a little bit. I thought you might want a little jam; you know, you can play along- do you have any spoons? Would you wanna- well, I'm just gonna play a little song for ya and if you wanna play along with me you’re welcome to it.Ali: So, I'm gonna start tapping I'm like-Ali (as Yashee): [Metal clinking together] Watch me! It's really fun!Kyle: Okay, roll me a performance check.Goodrich: I’m just watching [laughs] as a brown bear. I'm just peeking around the side of a rock.Ali: [Chuckling] Oh, It’s a two plus five.Kyle: [Rolls dice] Jaffney and Layla don’t seem really into it. They're like, stuck in their books but Jermaine is kind of looking, he’s like-Kyle (as Jermaine): Hey, well that’s- that’s interesting.Goodrich: So, I just barge in there as a brown bear! And uh, I can see that this isn’t going well so I just run through. A ’la Lost World with you know, having a little presentation and the triceratops bursts through-Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: So that’s me except for I’m a brown bear and I just go- [roars in a deep voice]Kyle: You just- okay! You run through- what are you trying to hit?Goodrich: Well I'm trying just to make a giant scene and hit the books so that they fly everywhere. You know, and as I run past Yashee, maybe I wink like-Ali: [Groans]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep voice] I got those books, go ahead![All laughing]Kyle: Yeah okay, so you run through there and you barrel through and books all fly up in the air.Goodrich: Probably a lot more than books fly.Kyle: Oh yeah, and-Goodrich: The entire-Kyle: Jermaine is knocked off balance and he falls into the back pack and the pile of books falls over. And Layla and Jaffney are just like- “What was that!? Oh my gosh!”Ali: I’m gonna take the opportunity and dash in. I even might go in hard like-Ali (as Yashee): Oh, let me help you with that!Ali: And I actually knock Jermaine a little bit farther away from the books-[All laugh]Kyle: Okay!Ali: In doing so I'm just gonna start gathering them and like try to look at as many covers as I can as fast as I can.Kyle: Roll me and investigation check.Ali: [Rolls dice] Uh, fifteen!Kyle: Fifteen? Okay so, you’re rifling through the books and you don’t find anything specific about Modulus but you do find a book about Algar’s Pantheon of Gods.Ali: Oh, okay! [Laughs] like, what size is the book? Will it fit into a pocket?Kyle: A pocket or something or-Ali: Wide pockets?Kyle: Yeah, give me a slight of hand, and do it at advantage since you knocked over Jermaine and Layla and-Ali: [Rolls dice] Fourteen!Kyle: And.. [Rolls dice] Yeah, so you’re able to sneak the book away. Ali: Cool! Well, I guess I’ll take it and head on out.Kyle: ‘Kay, you’re walking away and you kinda hear uh, you hear Jaffney say-Kyle (as Jaffney): What- what the heck was that?Kyle: And Layla responds-Kyle (as Layla): Oh, one of those bards is a druid.Goodrich: Wha-Kyle: And then you hear Jaffney just say-Kyle (as Jaffney): [Scoffs] Bards..[Players chuckle]Goodrich: So, she knows that I'm a druid?Kyle: Yeah! You know, she’s a high enough druid-Goodrich: Ooh, okay-Kyle: Where she can recognize her own type and where else is a bear in this desert gonna come from?Goodrich: Yeah, yeah good point.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Alright.Spurrier: Am I able to watch this whole thing?Kyle: Yeah, you see it happening!Spurrier: Oh, good! I'm so glad!Goodrich: But you didn’t see me fail at bear morphing, no.Spurrier: Oh no, no, I didn’t see-Ali: I’m just giggling and pointing from the other side. Ha ha!Spurrier: I did see that. Your shame.Goodrich: Are you just hanging out with Splash? Are you guys sharing uh-Spurrier: Yeah, I'm just sittin’ and watching.Kyle: Randy, as you’re sitting there watching this with Splash, Splash is just you know talking to you, and he’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Well your buddy’s are-Goodrich: [Laughing] Tearing the camp up!Kyle (as Symbol): Tearing the camp apart. You know, terrorizing the people. I think you should know I was talking with John over there and there seems to be some issues with what his team can do. Apparently if the meteor went deep enough under the surface it falls into different jurisdiction and that would be the Bureau of Underground Affairs and the U.P.P.S. John is going to have Jaffney run some tests tomorrow and while she does this you should investigate the area. I'm gonna be busy interviewing the people? You know like-Spurrier (as Randy): Sure.Kyle (as Symbol): Newspaper people should. But if you can investigate the area- and by you, I mean you and your troublesome trio that you have going on-Spurrier (as Randy): [Amused] They are putting on quite a show.Kyle (as Symbol): It’s very entertaining, I will admit-Spurrier (as Randy): As bards they’re doing fantastically.Goodrich: And in the background you hear- [Yelling in a deep distorted voice for the bear][Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol) But, let me ask you this while I also have you. Where’d you get your instrument?Spurrier (as Randy): [Pauses] Um..do you know of the Mons Organum?Kyle (as Symbol): I do, absolutely.Spurrier (as Randy): You do. Do you know about the halfling families who kept it for ages and ages?Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, the long line of the single family? Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah well, you’re looking at the last member of that line.Kyle (as Symbol): [Shocked] Oh..Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): And uh, well.. So, Nowhere Man training, all that you know, obviously for something as prestigious as that you need a final test to prove your worth.Kyle (as Symbol) Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): And uh, there was- well, there is- was, depending on how you look at it, a treasure way deep inside that mountainous organ and uh, getting it was my task.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay-Spurrier (as Randy): Because they knew I had access to it and kind of knew my way around it. I mean, I never spent a ton of time there. I wasn’t quite ready for it at the age that things happened.Kyle (as Symbol): Uh, right.Spurrier (as Randy): But I knew enough of it and uh, at that point it was a test not only of my skill but of betraying my family. Betraying my name and betraying the lineage that I came from, and when push came to shove family won out, and that’s when I split from them with both Eddie and the organ. Uh, you can see there’s double the reason why they’re after me.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): So, we’re just laying it all out on the table today!Kyle (as Symbol): Makes some sense, well, it’s good to hear that you didn’t turn on your family.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Um-Spurrier (as Randy): That was the- I mean, I was so disconnected from them cause I had left them when I was so young-Kyle (as Symbol): Right.Spurrier (as Randy): But uh, something clicked inside me when I was confronted with that choice.Kyle (as Symbol): Good to know.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, so-Kyle (as Symbol): I appreciate you confiding in me, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah of course, Splash.Goodrich: And at this point I run up and I'm like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Panting heavily in a deep voice then quickly goes back to normal] H-hey! Hey, uh, Yashee make it back? Where- where is-Ali: I come up; I'm skipping along.Spurrier: And I just stand up and I slowly- [Claps slowly][All laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Fan. Tastic! Encore!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You saw that huh? Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): That was wonderful.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup!Ali (as Yashee): Well look what came of it! Here you go.[Players excitedly congratulate Yashee]Ali (as Yashee): Uh, hopefully it will help. I don’t know, here Randy!Spurrier (as Randy): Oh! Thank you, uhh..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s it say?Spurrier: I’m flipping through-Spurrier (as Randy): All these pictures, I guess these are different gods. All these different illustrations and etchings.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Check the index, do you see anything in there about uh, what’s it called Splash?Kyle (as Symbol): Modulus.Goodrich & Spurrier: Modulus?Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, history was never really my subject- I mean, I would imagine- I mean, either of you guys-Kyle (as Symbol): Randy, we’re bards, we’re supposed to be cataloging history.[Players laugh loudly]Spurrier (as Randy): Well yeah, that’s what we came here to learn how to do!Kyle (as Symbol): Fair point.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah! So, Splash, I presume you have the most history.Kyle: Splash takes the book, he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): This is beginner god lore. I mean, Modulus is Altonia’s nephew; his father Tonis is the brother of Altonia.Goodrich: Jeez..Kyle (as Symbol): Tonis being the god of order, Modulus is the son being a little bit more chaotic. You know, transformations-Spurrier (as Randy): Sure!Kyle (as Symbol): So-Spurrier (as Randy): Sure, of course.Kyle (as Symbol): Um, but perhaps if you read through here, maybe match up sigils? Maybe you could find something that leads you in the right path.Goodrich: Okay, and I take it from Splash and I start going through it like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, let’s see here.Kyle (as Symbol): You three have fun with that, I'm gonna go bed down for the night.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey uh, if they say anything about a brown bear? You know..Kyle (as Symbol): What brown bear?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Heyyy, there he is!Kyle (as Symbol): Hey, I gotcha.Spurrier & Ali: Night, Splash!Goodrich: Night!Kyle (as Symbol): It’s Symbol.Ali: Let’s go into our tent and like-Spurrier: Yeah, we’ve had quite and evening, yeah.Goodrich: Yes.Ali: Maybe bring some moon stones in there with us-[Players yay]Ali: Put a blanket over us so people don’t have the glow- like flashlights at a sleep over.Goodrich: Plus, we did steal that book.[Players chuckle]Spurrier: Has Splashed walked away already?Kyle: Yeah-Spurrier: Okay, I'll just talk to him in the morning, it’s fine.Goodrich: Cool.Kyle: Alright, so you’re heading back to your tent; you’re gonna get ready to bed down and as you’re heading back, Raz’ul you hear somebody talk to you in dwarvish. Randy and Yashee, do you speak dwarvin at all?Spurrier: Nope!Ali: I do not, however, if it’s something that I might be wanting to listen in on I have comprehend language, so.Kyle: That is- that is your choice if you want to cast that. But, Raz’ul you hear Connor speak to you in dwarvish and say-Kyle (as Connor): [With heavy Scottish accent] M’lord I uh, [sighs] I’m afraid we should talk for a minute.Goodrich: I look behind me and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Huh?Goodrich: I point to myself.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You talkin’ to me? Uh-Kyle (as Connor): Yes, you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-Kyle (as Connor): You, M’lord. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we have a quick chat?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Nervous] Oh, I don’t know if now's the time.Spurrier: And you’re saying this in?Ali: Dwarvish.Spurrier: Dwarvish.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Kyle: Yeah, so you two can’t understand a word of what’s going on.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Ali: I’m not gonna cast it, seems like eh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know if now’s the time but..Kyle (as Connor): I don’t mean to press, my liege but I'm not one to not recognize my own royalty.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Defeated] Okay, this seem serious.Goodrich: Uh, and I switch back over to common and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, you guys can go get the tent set up and gather rocks up. This guy uh.Spurrier (as Randy): Everything cool?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah well, he [clears throat] he might have seen the brown bear and I'm just gonna make sure everything's cool, alright?Ali (as Yashee): You sure you don’t want me to stay with you?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhhhhh, no. No, that’s cool.Ali (as Yashee): I’ll tell this guy to scram if you want.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, he seems on the level but I'm just saying uh, you know just- [stammers] unless you guys wanna hear us talking our dwarven it's probably not a big deal.Ali (as Yashee): Ehh, it’s never been my favorite language.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Okay, that was uncalled for-[Overlapping conversation, laughter]Kyle: It sounds like gargling rocks.Ali: It’s impressive, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well you guys get that tent set up and I'll meet you guys in a little. I'm just gonna make sure this guy doesn’t go yakking.Ali (as Yashee): Let’s go find some nice moon stones to bring in.Spurrier (as Randy): Yes!Goodrich: And then I walk back over to Connor, switch back over to dwarvish and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey uh, yeah you look kinda familiar but I can’t- you said Rock Deep earlier or somethin’?Kyle (as Connor): Yeah, no, I- I know boy, I know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Connor): And I just wanna know are you finding what you’re supposed to by taking the ax?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I mean, I'm working on it. I mean, so far the juice has been worth the squeeze if you know what I mean?Goodrich: And I elbow him, cause that’s an old-Kyle (as Connor): [Chuckles]Goodrich: An old dwarf saying.Kyle (as Connor): I- yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, but Daz’ul’s not looking for me, is he? Or?Kyle (as Connor): No! No-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I kinda figured he wouldn’t even notice so-Kyle (as Connor): I might be speaking out of place, or out of turn-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah who are you, man? I mean Connor is all I've pretty much got so-Kyle (as Connor): Well- [sighs] It’s- she told us.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Softly] Oh.Kyle (as Connor): She told us. You know who she is right? The one which made that ax.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Realization] Oooh.Kyle (as Connor): She told us you’d come for it and again I'm- you might want to speak to your dad.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I don’t know..that guy..Kyle (as Connor): Cause there’s things I shouldn’t say.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, can you spill a little bit or?Kyle (as Connor): I am honor bound to my king and even though you may be his son-Goodrich: Can I do a persuasion check?Kyle: You can try!Goodrich: Alright! [Rolls dice] and it’s a two. [Chuckles] and I say, pleaaaaase?Kyle: He’s like-Kyle (as Connor): No.Goodrich: [Laughs] Okay.Kyle (as Connor): Again, I'm honor bound to your dad and uh, if anybody were to be able to speak the words to you that [sighs] it should be him.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Speak the words? What are you talking about?Kyle (as Connor): Ay, I shouldn’t have said that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Connor): I-I shouldn’t have said that.Goodrich: [chuckles, with accent] I should not have said that![All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, well listen, um-Kyle (as Connor): Lad, lad, you’ve got concern on your brow. I can see it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I mean you ain’t no snitch are ya? Who are you, man? Like, I mean you know who I am but I don’t really know who-Kyle (as Connor): Oh, I'm just a dwarf-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You from Oodalolli?Kyle (as Connor): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay well-Kyle (as Connor): It’s how I know of you, your family, my king.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah.. Well, are you going back there or you kind of traveling around with this crew?Kyle (as Connor): No, I consult now in Sundance.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh okay, cool. So, you’re like a- okay. Well listen, if any dwarfs come through.. I mean, maybe you don’t mention you ran into me here if that’s..Kyle (as Connor): If that’s what you want M’lord.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, if that’s cool with you man ‘cause I've made some really cool friends here which, I didn’t really have a lot of back in the mountain.Kyle (as Connor): I-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So- and I'm onto some really cool stuff with the ax and- I don’t- I don’t know, it’s been really great and I don’t- I'm not quite done.Kyle (as Connor): Well if uh, if that’s the goal intended for you having that ax-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well I mean, I'm looking into what it does. That's why I'm here, man is to figure out what’s going on so that you know, we can kinda use it for good even if it’s just sittin’ in the- I mean, I don’t really wanna get into everything so, let’s just leave it there and you know, I'm doing good stuff with it. I think that everything's going well, I've met two great people that’ve- I mean, that have been really good for me?Kyle (as Connor): Great!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s awesome! So, I just don’t want to uh, mess anything up so.Kyle (as Connor): That’s fair, M’lord.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool.Kyle (as Connor): You don’t have to worry about me, we’re kin.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, Awesome.Goodrich: Do we have like a dwarf handshake that we do?Kyle: Yeah, totally!Goodrich: Okay, we do it! And It's perfect.Kyle: Slap, dab, and take a nap!Goodrich: Here, I'm gonna roll for performance. [Rolls dice] Oh, ten! Uh, plus five, fifteen.Kyle: He very awkwardly manages his way through it and you can tell he’s not like, he’s just faking his way through it. He did bad, you did good.Goodrich: He’s a little bit older and I'm some of that young blood so-Kyle: Right, right, right yeah-Goodrich: He’s got- yeah so, I'm a little bit more in tune with it-Kyle: Ah! There you go![Players chuckle]Kyle: Ay!Goodrich: Ay! So, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright man, cool. Well, good talking with you but you know, we’re gonna go and you know- bards and whatnot, gotta practice and such. I'm in school now so I gotta study and whatnot-Kyle (as Connor): Ay, M’lord I'll leave you to it.Kyle: And he does like a very audacious salute.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah maybe tone that down a little.Kyle (as Connor): Oh, yeah-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah-Kyle (as Connor): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, no, you’re good.Kyle: And he heads off.Goodrich: Sweet, and I head back to the tent. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, I think we’re good uh, how’d you guys do while I was gone? Setting stuff up and whatnot.Spurrier: Uh let’s uh-[Players laugh]Ali: I have handfuls of moon stones.Goodrich: [Laughs] Aw.Kyle: Just being shoved in there?Ali: Yeah.Spurrier: Hanging them up around, making little chandeliers and such.Kyle: So again, the setup is three tent domiciles with two connecting to a center one?Goodrich: Nah I'm ditching that, let’s just all go in one tent, we all gotta read this book.Ali: Yeah, we just combined all three into one.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: I should use my drift globe, so I'm gonna have my drift globe kind of be the center piece of this. I'm gonna make the hue be of a fire, I'm gonna make it look like a camp fire and say-Spurrier (as Randy): Can one of you guys read this? It’s like a little camp fire story, learn about Modulus.Goodrich: Do you curl up in the corner like-Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: We kinda get it that you’ve been read to a lot so-Spurrier: Yeah![Players chuckling]Goodrich: Maybe you’re still kind of there-Ali: You take out Joby.Spurrier: I take out Joby.Goodrich: [Sigh] Okay.Kyle: Get all cuddled up?Goodrich & Spurrier: Yeah!Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Randy, why don’t you come over here and we’ll sit by Yashee?Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, alright, Yashee can read us a story.[Kyle laughs]Goodrich: You did get the book, this is kinda your pay off.Ali: Yup, yup!Kyle: Yeah!Ali: I read that chapter.Kyle: Okay, so you’re reading through the chapter over Modulus and-Ali: I’m making sure to turn the book and show them pictures-[All laugh]Ali: Showing them stuff, pointing it out.Ali (as Yashee): See that right there? That’s- yeah-Goodrich (as Randy): See that, Randy?[Both Goodrich and Spurrier, “ooh” in interest]Kyle: So yeah uh, and as Yashee reads through this you learn about Modulus and how Modulus is the god of transformation, and really helps with the school of transmutational magic. Another thing that you notice is there are a couple sigils that are very commonly used by worshipers of Modulus and one of them lines up with Randy’s tattoo.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Stop! Right there! Yashee, what’s that? What’s it say about that?Ali: Oh, and I-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It looks like Randy’s ink?Ali: Okay so, lets lift up his shirt-Spurrier: I lift up my shirt-Ali: Put ‘em side by side.Goodrich: Why don’t we do this? Why don’t- Randy, why don’t you lay on your tummy-Spurrier: Okay-Goodrich: And then Yashee and I can put the book right next to-[Kyle laughs loudly]Goodrich: The tattoo on your back.Spurrier: Then we’ll have the drift globe float up and turn white and it’ll be like, sort of like a doctor scene. Alright, we got this-Goodrich: Perfect.Spurrier (as Randy): Up, globe.Ali: We do that.Kyle: Alright, so the drift globe is floating above as Randy lies on his tummy. You two are matching up the books- Yashee and Raz’ul. And you match up the marking and you see the sigil that’s used in Randy’s tattoo is actually one that’s really close to the crack and has begun to kind of be affected by this crack. You notice that this sigil is referencing an impediment of magic. It’s almost like a uh, an anti-magical sigil to almost cancel out magical effects.Goodrich: And that's what's cracking?Kyle: Yeah, that’s what the crack is near at.Goodrich: [Worried] Oh boy.Spurrier: [Worried] Oh. Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Looks like you’re leaking magic, buddy.Spurrier (as Randy): Or leaking anti-magic.Goodrich: It’s gonna be twelve gold plus parts and labor to fix this up-[All laugh]Spurrier: Your insurance doesn’t cover this.Goodrich: Yeah, totally [chuckles]Spurrier: [Sighs] Oh boy.Goodrich: Is there anything on how to seal it back up? Cause I think that’s why-Kyle: There’s nothing in there pertaining to that. Yashee, you’re not seeing anything Ra’zul asks. You flip through- again, this seems like a general reference guide for just the Pantheon of Algar.Ali: Welp.Kyle: But you do have another book now! That’s pretty cool, right!?Goodrich: [Sighs] Yeah, I guess.Spurrier: We can learn and have story time every night. Learn all sorts of-Kyle: I have a lot of writing to do-Ali: One new god a night.[All chuckle, come back to this]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, we need to figure out a way to seal that up if there’s not a way to get Eddie out. That’s what I- that's where I-Spurrier: You said it’s a clerical symbol?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): We need to find a cleric, I guess.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, if we come across any apothecaries along the way- err, traveling.Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe Splash knows a cleric.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Knows where we can find one, at least.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, true-Spurrier (as Randy): We should- we'll talk to him again in the morning.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Chuckles] that’s all we do.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah- oh, speaking of Splash, he did say we need to uh, investigate tomorrow? That’s pretty much our job. I meant to ask him if he meant investigate on the surface or in that massive hole, but I forgot so.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m starting to see a correlation here between this crack on you, a giant hole, investigating [sighs]Spurrier (as Randy): It’s a lot of stuff going on.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oy vey.Spurrier (as Raz’ul): Also, just really quick-Spurrier: I won’t go through the whole thing again but I decide to tell you guys the whole story that I told Splash.Goodrich: Uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Just uh, we’re laying things out on the table today and that was uh- yeah, if Splash is gonna know you guys better damn well know-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, thanks for telling us.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, you guys are already guilty by association anyways. Might as well be filled in a little bit more.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Just finish tying that knot.Spurrier: [Chuckles] Exactly.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): So, sorry for making you guilty by association too but, you know-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s alright, yeah.Ali (as Yashee): If I'm getting in trouble, I'd rather it be with you guys.Spurrier: Aw.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Might as well.Spurrier (as Randy): You guys already did some awesome mischief today so.Goodirch (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we got in some funky junk today but eh, part for the course I suppose.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Listen, it’d probably a good idea to rest up cause I-Spurrier (as Randy): Exactly what I was gonna say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Transformed a little bit and I'm all tired from riding around all day.Kyle: Did you wanna go to sleep?[Players agree]Ali: Put on our jam-jams and hit the hay-Goodrich: Yeah-Spurrier (as Randy): Through the tunnel!Spurrier: And Randy dives through his tunnel, does an acrobatics- [rolls dice] that is a sixteen plus nine.Kyle: Y-yeah describe it.Goodrich: We don’t even know! We’re like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What the hell? Where did Randy go? [Players Laughs]Spurrier: Yeah! I take a running leap uh, I run and jump off of Raz’ul and dive straight first and I manage to do a spin, so I do a cork screw as I go through it and at least get a three hundred sixty, maybe close to seven-twenty.Goodrich: Do you wave to us as you go? Byee!Spurrier: Yeah, I look back. I wave with my feet.[All laugh]Goodrich: I get up and stretch and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I'm just gonna walk to mine so, night Yashee!Ali (as Yashee): Night!Ali: And I just lay down right there.Kyle: Mkay.Ali: I assume this one is my tent. [Chuckles]Kyle: Yeah.Ali: It’s the biggest.Goodrich: Yeah, exactly.Kyle: You lay down and uh, there’s a little tinkling on your ira glass and you hear a familiar voice, and it sounds like Tabitha.Kyle (as Tabitha): [Soft voice, concerned] Yashee, are you okay?Ali (as Yashee): [Yawns] Oh god, so tired- okay.Ali: I pick it up-Ali (as Yashee): [Confused] Hello?Kyle (as Tabitha): Yashee, it’s Tabitha!Ali (as Yashee): Oh, hi! I’m not usually the one to communicate through these things, I'm a little new at it.Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, I just got one too so I'm trying to figure it out. I- I think it’s-Ali (as Yashee): They’re pretty cool, right?Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, it’s pretty awesome! They're just kinda-Ali (as Yashee): Who knew?Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, right? Pretty awesome- um, so how’s the desert?Ali (as Yashee): It’s- eh, it’s been rough.Kyle (as Tabitha): Are you three okay?Ali (as Yashee): It’s alright though, we’ve been doing good. You know, we’re getting by.Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay, I had heard something from- [sighs] well, I just heard something- I just wanted to make sure you were okay and you weren’t-Ali (as Yashee): Wait, what did you hear?Kyle (as Tabitha): Weeeeell... [mumbling] somebody said voids, um, dark places.Ali (as Yashee): Who? Wait, its-Kyle (as Tabitha): It’s hard to explain-Ali (as Yashee): Come- come on, Tabitha. You gotta spill to me, let’s do this.Kyle (as Tabitha): You remember in the- in- when we were sparring?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah?Kyle (as Tabitha): Remember how I got weird?Ali (as Yashee): It got a little weird.Kyle (as Tabitha): That’s uh, that’s somebody helping me and um, apparently, they let me know that they got to chat with you and your friends.Ali (as Yashee): [Surprised] Oooh! That dude’s helping you?Kyle (as Tabitha): I mean he’s- yeah.Ali (as Yashee): He’s really creepy.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, he is a little bit but uh, I was just- I was just concerned. I wanted to, you know, make sure you were okay after hearing.Ali (as Yashee): Oh yeah, I mean he let us out of the void and then we had some fun!Kyle (as Tabitha): Oh!Ali (as Yashee): We had like a little race.Kyle (as Tabitha): [Sighs in relief] Okay..okay.Kyle: And she sounds really- she's like-Kyle (as Tabitha): I’ll be interested to hear that story, I just wanted to make sure you were alright.Ali (as Yashee): I’ll tell you all about it when we get back. It has been-Kyle (as Tabitha): I mean-Ali (as Yashee): Pretty fun.Kyle (as Tabitha): I think you three-Ali (as Yashee): I mean, the last day has been rough but before that it was like, great.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah? Well, that’s good! I'm glad to hear that! I just think you three might be the only ones who have seen that. I-Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Yelling] Keep it down in there, Yashee! We’re trying to sleep!Ali (as Yashee): Sorry![Players laughing]Kyle (as Tabitha): I know it’s late, I just wanted to make sure that you were okay and, you know..Ali (as Yashee): Well I- thanks for checking in on me, it’s really nice of you!Kyle (as Tabitha): That’s no problem, you know, um, deserts pretty nice? S’dry?Ali (as Yashee): No, it’s the desert.[All laughing]Goodrich: That’s terrible!Kyle (as Tabitha): Um, okay well, some people find beauty in it, I dunno.[All chuckling]Kyle (as Tabitha): I’ve never been myself but- okay, okay, I'm sorry- I just- I had to double check. I’ll let you go, I know it’s late, Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): It’s alright- hey, we’ll grab breakfast or something when I'm back, you know?Kyle (as Tabitha): I’d enjoy that.Ali (as Yashee): Give you the break down.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, hopefully I'm around and we’re not out on assignment when you get back.Ali (as Yashee): Okay! Well, night Tabitha.Kyle (as Tabitha): Night, Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): (Mumbles)Kyle: Alright, and now we can all go to sleep![Lullaby plays, boys singing something, unsure]Ali: Oh no, we’re gonna have weird dreams again.Kyle: Yup!Ali: Thanks, man.Goodrich: Is it a dreamless sleep, kyle? For the love of-Ali: Modulus-[All laughs]Kyle: Modulus, for the love of Modulus [laughs] Alright so, you get an uneasy night of sleep but still you’re rested, it’s a long rest. But, you’re woken in the morning by Symbol and he slaps the outside of your tents and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Come on, Jermaine went missing overnight and John wants everyone up so-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Groans]Kyle (as Symbol): Let’s get going.Kyle: And you wake up and you still have that uneasy feeling where it’s like, somebody’s watching you.Ali: Like, we feel like that in the tent?Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: [Gasps in surprise] great, no the suspense is terrible. I hope it’ll last.[All laugh]Goodrich: Just kidding, Kyle!Kyle: I dunno, we’ll see what happens.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: So, you three leave your tents?Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Yeah?Ali: Greet the morning.Spurrier: Greet the morning.Goodrich: I might go to the bathroom real quick I guess but-Ali: We don’t talk about that.[All laugh]Goodrich: I don’t go in the tent!Spurrier: I was about to say-Goodrich: I go outside- nevermind!Kyle: Find the sand.Ali: Right in the corner. [Imitating Raz’ul] Don’t mind me.Kyle: Paw your feet over your mess, your waste to hide your disgrace.Goodrich: Yeah- I go out as a cat and I go in the sand.[All laugh]Kyle: Well I mean, you have to roll for that if you wanna do it.Goodrich: [Disappointed] Oh.Spurrier: Do you have cat on your-Goodrich: Yeah, I do actually!Ali: Oh.Goodrich: [Laughing] I’m not gonna roll for it though![All laughing]Kyle: I’m not gonna waste my one of two.Goodrich: Yeah, so I get out of the tent, yeah.Kyle: Okay, so you head outside and you notice that everyone is gathered at the ridge of the crater. You walk up the ridge and you get to the top, and you can see that John and Jaffney are facing the rest of the group from the bottom and John looks just absolutely livid. He’s kind of almost fuming in a way, and he says-Kyle (as John): [Annoyed] Okay, we’re all here so of course as with most of this assignment.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jermaine’s- I don’t see Jermaine anywhere.Kyle (as John): Yes, that’s one reason-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as John): That this assignment keeps proving its difficulties for me-Kyle: And uh-Goodrich: I put my hand back down.Kyle (as John): [Harshly] Thank you.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as John): [Annoyed] Jermaine has decided to go ahead and do some spelunking without us. For what reason, I do not know. This is before we know if we even have permission to descend into this godsforsaken hole. Jaffney, if you do not mind, please just do the test.Kyle: And at this point, Jaffney kind of just like, nods and walks over to the hole and begins to make hand gestures and produces a large yarn ball. The ball is really fuzzy and it seems to quiver as she holds it in her hands. She leans in and whispers to it really quietly, and it makes a small cooing sound then jumps out of her hand and begins to unravel and roll down the hole out of sight.Goodrich: Man, it’s a good thing I didn’t transform into a cat or I'd-[All laughing loudly]Kyle: [Chuckling] Yes, um, so at this point Jaffney says-Kyle (as Jaffney): Well, John this is gonna take a moment.Kyle: And he nods and you notice Symbol starts going around and talking to Layla and Connor and talking to a few over the other people. Tries to talk to John for a moment- it looks like he’s interviewing them as Luey Hewis. So-Goodrich: I wanna call out to him and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Luey, Luey! Uh, come over here, we wanna give you a bardic take on things!Kyle: Okay, he comes over and he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): [With a New York accent] Yeah so uh, what is going on? Is there anything in your investigation that you found so far?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Is this going in like, a real paper, Splash?Goodrich: I whisper to him.Kyle (as Symbol): [Whispering, with Symbol’s voice] I have to do this for the real Luey, otherwise he might lose his job.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, you’ll like, publish stuff that we say to you?Kyle (as Symbol): Yes.[Ali chuckles]Goodrich: Oh, guys..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are we on record?Kyle (as Symbol): [ New York accent] Yeah, you’re on the record! What’dya got to say?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay! We’re Chaos Sauce, uh, if you have parties, if you have events and stuff, we’re available! We are a trio, we play music, uh it’s real good!Kyle (as Symbol): That’s not relevant to anything going on here!Ali (as Yashee): Our teacher’s uh, Symbol but he likes to go by Splash, that’s his name now.[Players laughing]Kyle (as Symbol): I don’t think that’s right at all!Ali (as Yashee): And that’s a direct quote, you can quote me on that!Kyle (as Symbol): Alright, direct quote.Kyle: And he’s mimicking writing in his page obviously.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes, this is all good stuff. Have you found anything in your investigation of the area?Spurrier: And I whisper to you-Spurrier (as Randy): [Whispering] Really quick, when you said investigate just like- above the ground? On the ground? Down in the ground? Like what do you-Kyle (as Symbol): [In Symbol’s voice] Just, not down the hole, just in the area.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, okay!Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, I wouldn’t go down in that hole, it’ll really piss off john.Spurrier (as Randy): Well here, just to put us back on track- Uh, yes! This is Randy Greentrees-[Players laugh)Spurrier (as Randy): That’s G-R-E-E-N-T-R-E-E-S-Ali: You don’t know how to spell that![All laugh]Kyle: That’s true!Spurrier (as Randy): That’s pronounce- greeeeen treeess-Kyle (as Symbol): [New York accent] Yes, like green trees.Spurrier (as Randy): That’s correct, yes, thank you. I wanted to second the motion by Yashee. He does go by Splash now, we do need that in two sets of prints; make it official, the judicators will need to see that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And I third it-Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, a third! Thank you, and the motion is passed, meeting adjourned. It has been nice chatting with you-Ali: I knock a mallet a rock.[Players laugh]Ali: We’re done here.Spurrier (as Randy): Have a lovely day, lovely chatting with you.Ali (as Yashee): Were we gonna talk to him about the book and what we-Spurrier (as Randy): Oh right-Ali (as Yashee): Discovered?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, also, do you know any clerics?Kyle (as Symbol): [With Symbol’s voice] I mean, there’s Dogum back in town but-Spurrier (as Randy): Any other clerics?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No clerics, clerics for-Spurrier (as Randy): Are these people clerics for Modular- Modulus?Kyle (as Symbol): Modulus, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Know any clerics for Modulus?Kyle (as Symbol): I’d have to look through my contacts but I can’t I-Spurrier (as Randy): Apparently, it’s a cleric rune and that’s what’s causing all the problems, that’s where the crack is.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And Randy’s all out of his lotion so we need to get that prescription filled.[Spurrier laughs]Kyle (as Symbol): Okay well, the faster we get through here the quicker we might be able to take care of that.[Players agreeing]Kyle (as Symbol): We’re in the middle of nowhere right now.Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s go investigate.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Symbol): Alright.Kyle: Roll me a group investigation!Spurrier: [Makes a fan-fare noise]Goodrich: Is Splash rolling too?Kyle: Nope, he is going back to interview the stuff- [Softly] and his names Symbol.Ali: I got a five.Kyle: Five?Spurrier: Eighteen plus one.Kyle: Cool.Goodrich: Seventeen plus one.Kyle: Alright, Yashee you’re kind of going around the area and kind of just checking out the ridge and whatnot. Uh, so you find sand.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Way to go, Yashee.Ali: Cool! Well, I'll go head and sit down and I dunno, maybe see if I can build a little sand castle or something.[All laugh]Kyle: [Amused] Okay-Goodrich: Yes, you’re doing that.Kyle: Uh, Randy, Raz’ul? You two begin investigating the area around the hole and you notice that there is a obvious path where somebody slid down into the hole. And you can only surmise that this is what Jermaine did.Spurrier: Ah.Kyle: You notice there’s a grain or a corkscrewing kind of uh-Spurrier: Pattern?Kyle: Pattern, yeah.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Pattern inside this tunnel.Spurrier: Ooh.Kyle: And it goes all the way around it, and-Goodrich: Looks like a sick water slide.Kyle: Yeah, in a way! In fact, it looks liquidy in a way too-Goodrich: Ooh!Kyle: It looks like there’s a viscus slime that coats the walls.Spurrier: Just on that pattern as it goes down?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle: So- there's nothing dripping, it’s just there and kind of glistens in the sun a little bit. Looks really odd. And at this point, you can just turn back and Jaffney’s been holding onto the tail end of this yarn ball that went down there. And, it actually starts circling back up- you can see it coming back up the tunnel and it hops into her hand, and she puts her ear to it real close and she says-Kyle (as Jaffney): Ah it’s not- not good, John. We don’t have clearance; this is different jurisdiction.Kyle: John starts fuming and he’s holding a parchment and looks it over, and he throws it onto the ground and stomps it and he’s just like-Kyle (as John): [Sighs, angry] Fine, pack it up! Pack it up, we’re getting out of here then!Kyle: At this point Erin walks over and goes-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah John uh, you can go ahead and pack up. Me and mine- we're going down there. We're here to get down to business and um, you three bards? You’re with us, right?[Players eagerly agree]Kyle (as Erin): We’re going down there- if you- if you and your bureaucratic restrictions can’t seem to find your way down there that’s your problem. You can go ahead and get.Kyle: And John replies.Kyle (as John): Oh- oh okay, you think it’s so easy?Kyle: And she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I’ve been underground a lot more than you probably have in your life and uh, I feel comfortable getting on down there.Kyle: John says-Kyle (as John): Well, what are you gonna do without our equipment? If we take everything back how are you gonna get down there? [Scoffs] Yeah, you have bards, but what- are they gonna be able to like, play their way to the bottom of the hole? They gonna play a song to get down there? Kyle: And Erin looks at you three and she goes-Kyle (as Erin): Can you?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee knows feather fall.Ali (as Yashee): We might need a little more power than that-Goodrich: So anyways-Ali (as Yashee): To carry all of us-Goodrich: Here’s feather fall.Ali: I’ll just play feather fall.Kyle (as Erin): I mean-Ali: I count everybody-Ali (as Yashee): I can’t get everyone down there guys-Kyle: Okay well, feather falls not an option. You can’t get enough-Ali (as Yashee): But maybe if we work together-Goodrich: (as Raz’lul): Maybe if we-Ali (as Yashee): It could be like a super feather fall.Goodrich: [Chuckles] Oh god, mother of all feather falls.Spurrier: Let’s do it.Goodrich: I’m down.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Erin): Oh crap, this gonna be great! Ya’ll ready for this? John, you go ahead and pack on up I'm ready to see a show happen!Kyle: And uh, let’s go ahead-Goodrich: Yay!Kyle: And roll some chord dice.Goodrich: Hurray![Electronic music plays]Kyle: Alright, before we roll chord dice, minor or major?Spurrier: Um..Ali: Gosh..Spurrier: I mean, it’s a creepy place but we’re trying to give them a positive experience getting down the hole.Ali: Yeah, we want us to get down there safely.Spurrier: Yeah, seems like major would be-Goodrich: And Ring of Fire is in major, you know? It’s all about going down, down, down slowly though.[Players agree, laughter]Spurrier: That’s a good justification as any.Ali: Major.Spurrier: Major it is!Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: Let’s do it![Multiple dice rolling]Kyle: I always get the wild.Goodrich: You do, Kyle. Here you go.Kyle: [Unintelligible, rolls dice]Goodrich: So, we’ve got E-minor, D-minor, A-minor and G, so-Ali: And then our C, right?[All agreeing]Goodrich: Plenty to work with there.Kyle: What’s uh- what's going on with them drums, Ali?Ali: Let’s find out!Goodrich: Drum roll!Ali: Let’s do this. [Coin hits a surface] Okay, second bank- [rolls dice] Okay twenty-two, I can- I can do that. So, rock twenty-nine.Goodrich: Alright!Ali: [Rolls dice] And the kit is-Kyle: [Surprised] You rolled a twenty-nine!?Ali: What? [chuckles] and I rolled a twenty-nine again, uh, oh, it’s hip-hop three. We just-Kyle: More hip-hop.Spurrier: More hip-hop, rock and roll-Ali: I don’t think this is the same one either, I think I had hip-hop two in the last one.Spurrier: Yeah, or something like that.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So, rock and hop!Ali: We’ll see!Kyle: Cool, alright get to it.[Music transitions]Kyle: Heey there, hi there, ho there!

Uh, [chuckles] let’s hear what this sounds like real quick.[Fast upbeat drum begins to play]This isn’t so bad, I think I can do this.Kyle (Rapping): Looking for comedy, and don’t know where to stop? I know a fresh show, called the Legion of Renob. It’s dark, and it’s gritty and it’s filthy as hell. No one in the mid-west does pseudo D and D so well. With Clark, Andrew, Wilson, Chris and Bobby- it's more than a game, it’s not just a hobby. So, hop right on board, just get in on this mess. We’ve got days of good content and dozens of guests. If you want humor, that’s more than the bomb, find us right here at Legion of Renob dot com.[Music stops]Kyle: Thanks for that one Legion of Renob, again that’s www.legionofrenob.com, Legion of Renob, R-E-N-O-B. Alright, let’s get back to the show and hear what those bards have come up with! [Imitates music transition] That’s how it goes? Huh?[Music transitions]Ali (as Yashee): Well- well maybe we will play our way to the bottom! Guy’s follow my lead![Fast upbeat drum begins, piano and guitar soon follow]All (singing): So, we need to get down to the bottom of the hole,  We can do the S.S. Chaos sauce  Do a magical dance then you’re in control,  When we do the S.S. Chaos     Flap your wings like a bird in flight  Then turn around to the left to the right  Now Clap your hands up above your head  And keep it up or we’ll be dead.    We got all this stuff lying round the camp.  We can make the S.S. Chaos Sauce  It’ll make a floor where we can dance and vamp,  Set sail on the S.S. Chaos Sauce     Flap your wings like a bird in flight  Then turn around to the left to the right  Now clap your hands up above your head  And keep it up or we’ll be dead     Set sail on the S.S. Chaos Sauce[Music ends][Music continues softly in the background throughout]Kyle: Okay, so you grab your instruments and begin playing with the intent to craft a way to get down this hole and your instruments just beam with magic as soon as you start performing. You give your instructions through your song of how people are supposed to dance by flapping their wings, turning left, turning right. The only people that are dancing with you are the mining trio. They take a second to buy in but then they’re like-Goodrich: Yeah-Kyle: Okay, yeah we can buy into this.Goodrich: Once the groove hits they’re like, “Okay!”Kyle: Yeah-Goodrich: Okay!Kyle: You can see Erin kind of like, you know, nudging the other two on like- Kyle (as Erin): [Mumble] Listen- you know, come on.Goodrich: I imagine Symbol just throws right up on his shoes cause this is probably his worst nightmare realized.[All laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] As a professional musician he’s like- [makes a retching sound]Kyle: Nah, he’s- he’s looking and he kind of looks like, a little bemused? You know?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Yeah he’s just like-[Kyle and Goodrich hum in uncertainty]Kyle: See what happens here. But uh, as you’re playing- they're dancing, they’re flapping their wings. They're turning left, they’re turning right! They’re clapping their hands! And you know, they’re making sure no ones dead, but as this is going on materials from the campsite start floating over the edge of the crater and begin coming in. Metal poles that were holding up the tents, different pieces of material from the tables, chairs, the actual tent itself-Goodrich: Like sort of Misone style with-Kyle: Yes-Goodrich: When all the pots and pans start floating around-Kyle: Yeah! Or you could imagine it more like Beetlejuice when everything starts dancing around!Goodrich: Totally! Yeah.Kyle: Yeah, I'm on the line.Goodrich: Yup, yup, yup.Kyle: So, you’re rocking your body in time and um-[Players laugh]Kyle: All these things start to form together and coalesce and make like, a dance floor and it’s making little pops in different areas that’s catching the light, and it’s kind of simulating a little bit of dance light show.Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: The three miners dance their way over to it and test it out.Goodrich: They dip their toe in?Kyle: Just a little bit.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And its floating right near the edge of the hole and the step on it, and they’re able to continue dancing on it.Spurrier: Yees!Kyle: And it’s going, and John looks at you three and he says-Kyle (as John): [Aggressively] Fine! Fine, if you six wanna go down there, the rest can’t! They're official bureau members and this..reporter, he doesn’t have clearance. So, if you wanna go kill yourselves go right ahead! That’s fine!Goodrich: [Sadly] No Luey?Ali: Yeah uh-Ali (as Yashee): Hey Luey! Hey, c’mere real quick!Kyle: And Luey looks at you three and is like-Kyle (as Symbol): [New York accent] I’m sorry I uh, I have to listen to the man who’s giving me clearance to be out here otherwise I could lose my press pass.Ali: Then at this point we’re on a floating, dancing floor? Right? So, I reach my hand out and I'm like-Ali (as Yashee): Do you trust me?[All chuckle]Kyle (as Symbol): [New York accent] Yashee, from what Symbol has told me about you, yes I trust you. But I gotta keep my job. I do trust you however to get the scoop.Kyle: And he winks.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, okay.Ali: [Softly] I wink back.Spurrier: Alright, well it’s vamping- Randy keeps vamping with one hand and pulls out his Joby, smashes it against the side and yells-Spurrier (as Randy): I christen this The S.S. Chaos Sauce![All laugh]Goodrich: And off we go!Spurrier: On its maiden voyage!Kyle: Alright and with that you begin to descend into the hole. What lies ahead of you? You're not sure. But it gets darker, and darker and those with dark vision, you can see the slide path that Jermaine left behind is going all the way down. What’s down there? I think we’ll have to find out next time.-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-16-dark-places-strange-faces,"Ep. 16 – Dark Places, Strange Faces","Ep. 16 – Dark Places, Strange FacesGoodrich: Check-ity, check, check, everybody talk into your microphones-[All making silly noises overlapping each other]Goodrich: Okay, that’s probably what dissonant whispers actually sounds like.[All laugh][Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed. Let's recap last episode real quick. So, our bards started off setting up camp. They got to meet Jermaine; Randy really didn’t trust Jermaine too much, I don’t know why but-[Players snickering]Kyle: The other two didn’t really seem to care that Randy didn’t trust Jermaine.Goodrich: You’re probably the only person who knows why.Kyle: Oh yeah that’s right, I forgot!Goodrich: Oh, right!Kyle: But after that you were able to get Symbol to the side and talk to him a little bit about the tattoo on Randy’s back. He informed you that it was related to Modulus the god of transformation. And from there, Randy you were reminded that there was a person in the Nowhere Man that went by Dr. The Patient who spoke a lot about Modulus. So, after finding out this information you decided well, maybe the two people who are looking through the big pile of books with Jermaine- perhaps they have a book that we can find. And you devised a very, very odd plan to get a hold of this book but you managed to do it successfully.Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: And you found out that symbol that’s on your back- where the crack is, you found out that that’s actually related to an anti-magical sealing. So, after all that happened and went down- we had a little bit of insight into Randy’s backstory. Connor had a conversation with Raz’ul, we got a little bit there and we ended the night with Tabitha giving a little phone call to Yashee.Ali: Yeah!Kyle: The next morning you three were woken up by Symbol and it had turned out that Jermaine went missing. You were actually also finding out if the people from the bureau could actually descend down into the hole. Apparently, it turns out they were out of their jurisdiction because it had gone too deep. But that being said the three miners- Erin, Trish and Alphonse, they were determined to go down there and of course Erin looked at you three bards and said, “You are going with us, right?” and of course being bards of your word, you kept it.[Players chuckle]Kyle: So, you performed a song to schlep together- I don’t even know how to describe it. A dance floor of sorts-Goodrich: Totally.Spurrier: Yes.Kyle: And dance and sung your way down the hole and that is where we are picking up.Goodrich: We’re twerking-Kyle: Going down the hole.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Twerking our way down the hole.Kyle: [To the tune of “whistle while you work”] Whistle while you twerk [whistling to tune] Okay so, you’ve been dancing and playing your way down this hole on your floating, magical tent garbage thing for about forty-five minutes or so-[Players laugh]Goodrich: [Shocked] Forty-five minutes!?Kyle: Yeah, just about!Goodrich: Are we taking breaks to get water, hopefully?Spurrier: We can take turns vamping.Goodrich: Okay, good.Kyle: Good call.Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: Good call, Randy.Goodrich: I’ll sit this eight out and grab a drink [chuckles]Kyle: So, the only light that’s currently going on is what’s being emitted from your instruments. Which is enough to light up the area you’re dancing on but nothing substantial. However, Raz’ul and Yashee you have dark vision so, you can see things that are around you which is just the hole you’re going down right now-Spurrier: Can I have my drift globe out, and have it like in disco mode?[Players laugh]Spurrier: Light the way down?Kyle: Yeah, yeah we’ll say you did that at the last minute like, “oh wait! This would be way better!” on one of your breaks.Spurrier: Yeah, there we go!Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: And you did say that the little grain in the wall?Spurrier: Corkscrew?Goodrich: Corkscrew, we can see that still, right?Kyle: Yeah there’s a slight bioluminescence to it.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: Yeah, it’s about thirty feet down you notice it’s the end of the hole.Goodrich: Oh!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, it’s the end of the hole!Ali (as Yashee): Does it look safe down there? What are we landing on?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s wrap this up, get to the final four and uh-[Excited overlapping conversation]Kyle: Okay, Yashee you look down and you can see there’s really nothing in the way. There's some ruble around the area, around the landing area, but other than that there’s not much and so, you float down to the bottom and you wrap up the song, and the garbage tent dance floor just you know, slowly floats to the ground and then you’re just standing on the ground on top of your stuff.Goodrich: Nailed it.Kyle: The other three hop off, the three miners, Whimpy goes to strike up a torch but then he’s like, “well looks like your drift globe-” and then puts it away.[Players chuckle]Kyle: So, it’s a medium sized cavern with- there's a path that goes to the left or the right from where you stand. The way to your left goes deeper underground while the right is only at a slight incline and you hear a droplet of water every so often, and you notice there’s a pool of water nearby that has a stalactite hanging above it. And around the area you know, there’s stalactites and stalagmites around and a few of those are joined into columns, but yeah that’s pretty much what you see in this area. Spurrier (as Randy): Well, which way?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well I mean, I think Boom Queen, Whimpy, Erin, you guys wanna lead the way? We don’t really know where we are.Kyle: Erin kind of looks around, she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Um, Whimpy if you don’t mind just you know, making sure everything looks structurally sound around this area? I don’t want it caving in on us while we’re down here. We have to have our exit of course.Ali (as Yashee): Caving in?Kyle (as Erin): Yeah well, hopefully not.Ali (as Yashee): [Scared] Oh.Kyle (as Erin): Oh?Ali (as Yashee): [Scared] Hey guys, I didn’t think about this.Kyle (as Erin): Y-yeah?Ali (as Yashee): I didn’t think this through very well.[Soft chuckling]Kyle (as Erin): Why? What’s wrong, Yashee?Ali (as Yashee): I just- I don’t really like small, dark places where I can’t get out of. So-[All laughing]Kyle (as Erin) Well, you should have said something a long time ago!Ali (as Yashee): I kind of just pictured this, you know, really big open area underground, not-Kyle (as Erin): Well there are areas like that, we might find one, who knows? This is just the first room that we’ve come across so-Ali (as Yashee): [Relieved] Oh okay, phew.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well let’s just get to it so we can get Yashee out of here.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah!Ali: I’m just gonna stay real close to Randy and-Goodrich: And the drift globe?Ali: [Chuckles] Yeah.Spurrier: Yeah, I turn it to a very warming, comforting hue.Goodrich: Yeah, you can just hold it next to your little cheek.[All chuckle]Kyle: You three give me perception checks real quick.[Dice hitting the table]Kyle: See if you notice anything else.Spurrier: That is a twelve plus three.Ali: Fifteen.Kyle: Fifteen, fifteen, Raz’ul?Goodrich: That is a seven plus five, twelve! [singing] one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten-Spurrier & Goodrich: [Singing] Eleven, twelve.[Goodrich humming tune]Kyle: Twelve, alright. So Yashee and Randy, you hear a trickling of water coming from the passage to the right and it’s at this point Trish points it out as well, says-Kyle (as BoomQueen): Yeah, I think I hear a stream coming from that direction, which, flowing water might be the best source to go to first.Spurrier (as Randy): Given things drying up I mean, yeah that seems-Kyle: [Laughs] Yeah-Spurrier (as Randy): Seems reasonable.Goodrich: We’ve solved the mystery!Kyle (as BoomQueen): Yeah, I mean it sounds like it makes sense.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup!Kyle: So, ya’ll wanna go to the path to the right?[Players agree]Kyle: Okay, I need you to let me know what order do you want people to walk in?Goodrich: Uhhh..Kyle: Cause the path to the right narrows and it looks like it would only be a single file sort of situation.Goodrich: Well-Ali (as Yashee): Maybe some of the experts should go first? I mean, you’d be able to see anything coming-Spurrier (as Randy): Maybe also be in the back too?Ali (as Yashee): Well yeah.Kyle: Whimpy shrugs his shoulders and is like-Kyle (as Whimpy): [Mumbling] Alright..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What? Is that okay, Whimpy?Kyle (as Whimpy): [Mumbling, barely audible] Eh, that’s fine.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I- do you wanna go first? What do you wanna do Whimpy?Kyle (as Whimpy): [Mumbling, barely audible] I don’t care, I can go first.Goodrich: Can I roll, I guess an insight check? See if he’s okay?Kyle: Yeah, see if he’s cool with going first?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Nineteen plus five, twenty, twenty, twenty-four.Kyle: I mean, despite the nonchalant demeanor you can tell he’s being serious like, he’s okay.Goodrich: Okay, sweet-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, if you wanna go first-Kyle (as Whimpy): [Mumbling, barely audible] Yeah, I'll go first.[Players chuckle]Kyle: Alright, who wants to go second?Spurrier: I’ll go second.Ali: Alright well them I'm gonna go immediately third then.Goodrich: And I’ll go right behind Yashee.Kyle: Alright- [Quickly] Whimpy, Randy, Yashee, Raz’ul- [normal] Let’s say, Erin and Trish.Spurrier: Perfect.Goodrich: Make a big ol’ Yashee sandwich.Ali: Mm..Goodrich: Now I don’t want you getting all started on sandwiches, Yashee but-[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Don’t worry, we’re gonna make it.Ali: Not gonna be out of here for awhile, I can get very hungry.Kyle: I can imagine Yashee actually getting confused like- [Imitating Yashee] We’re in the desert, maybe sand witches?[Players laugh]Kyle: Witches of sand?Ali: That’s what I was trying to do with the sand castles earlier was build like a sand witch castle.Kyle: Yeah? [laughs]Ali: Try to-Kyle: It’s really white sand, you could make a white castle.Ali: [Defeated] Oh, god.Kyle: Okay, you begin to make you way towards the right passage and as you near the entrance, Randy and Yashee give me perception checks.[Dice rolling]Ali: That’s uh, one plus one.Kyle: [Pained] Ooh, yeah..Spurrier: It is an eighteen plus three.Kyle: Okay, Yashee you looked up and you got, you know, water dripped in your eye. You're wiping it out-Goodrich: Or Yashee just has her eyes shut like, “It’s gonna be okay, it’s gonna be okay.”[Ali laughs]Kyle: Alright, you got a twenty-one you said, Randy? Randy, so you’re walking and you notice this about the same time as Whimpy does. There is a really large stalagmite that is near the passageway and there is an eyelid that pops open.Spurrier: [Surprised] Oh!Kyle: Tentacles erupt from it and start flailing about and begin flying in your direction. They move past you towards other people. One of them grabs up Whimpy and wraps him up completely, another one is grasping you Randy.Spurrier: Great.Kyle: And let’s see who else is gonna get grasped here. Let me just- let me just roll to figure this out.[Players chuckle]Kyle: [Rolls dice] First ones gonna be Erin and Raz’ul, and then the last one missed. So, overall you notice this large stalagmite with a big eye. All the sudden its mouth opens up and starts to pull Whimpy towards its mouth like it’s gonna take a big ol’ bite. Let’s roll some initiative.Goodrich: Oh, boy! Wasting no time.Spurrier: ‘Kay.[Multiple dice rolling]Kyle: Raz’ul, what’d you get?Goodrich: I got a two! Plus, nothing.Kyle: Well that’s nothing, alright. Randy?Spurrier: I got a nine plus three.Kyle: Nine plus three.Ali: I got a natural twenty.[Everyone “whoooa”’s]Goodrich: Spurrier’s gotta upload- it's not ready-Ali: Darn-[Angelic chorus of “Oh yeaaah!’ plays]Goodrich: There it is!Spurrier: Yeah well, it’s still special.[All chuckle]Kyle: Alright so, Trish and Yashee are free.Goodrich: You got this.Kyle: We are gonna start initiative with Yashee at the top.Ali: Alright so I think seeing you know, Randy get grappled is throwing me- I'm having a moment.Kyle: Okay-[Other player laugh]Ali: So, I'm gonna use a reckless attack which is a barbarian trait, the first attack of my turn I get advantage using melee, using strength, advantage on it.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Can my foot count as a melee weapon?Kyle: yes.Ali: Okay so, I’m just gonna try to do like a leap in front of Randy and like, stomp down on this tentacle so hopefully it lets go or-Kyle: Okay-Ali: You know, gets a nice little smash going-Kyle: Go ahead and roll your attack.Kyle: Stomp the yard.Ali: [Rolls dice] it’s an eleven plus three.Kyle: Eleven plus three? Unfortunately, the tentacle is wiggling around quite a bit. It looks very dexterous and very hard to hit and you’re sitting there trying to stomp on it and it just keeps moving back and forth. You're not able to get a good stomp in.Ali: [Softly] Okay.Kyle: You look like you’re trying to play, you know, wack-a-mole with your feet.[Players chuckle]Kyle: That takes us to this thing that you’re fighting and it is going to take a bite at Whimpy. [Rolls dice] And it does, it takes a nice big bite out of his shoulder. There's a good bit of bleeding going on and Whimpy’s just like- [screams] screaming; this is the most you’ve heard from Whimpy-[Players laugh]Kyle: So far so uh, you know you’re getting a bit of insight into what he sounds like.Goodrich: Into what it sounds like when he’s getting his shoulder chomped.[All laugh]Kyle: Yeaaah. That is going to be one of the four attacks it can make for its turn it is actually going to try and grapple Yashee- [rolls dice] with one of its tendrils. Yashee, that does grapple you.Ali: Cooool.Kyle: And Trish is grappled as well.Goodrich: So, we’re all grappled except for Erin?Kyle: Everyone is grappled except for Erin.Goodrich: Oh boy, it’s a good thing she sobered up.[Players laugh]Kyle: And-Goodrich: We’d be so screwed.Kyle: Yashee, as it grapples you it also pulls you closer towards its mouth-Ali: Oh!Kyle: Like Whimpy-Ali: Hey just to ask, are my arms grappled too or is it like, grappled under my arms-Kyle: It’s around your waste. I'll say everyone is grappled around their waist or in a way where your arms are useable.Ali: Okay-Kyle: I’m not gonna be rude.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: But that ends that monsters turn and we go to Randy.Spurrier: Okay so, since I'm grappled, if I was gonna try to escape that strength check?Kyle: Yeah, you would have to make a strength check.Spurrier: Okay cool, and then you said our arms are free. So, if I was to sneak attack how would that-Kyle: You actually wouldn’t have sneak attack because you’re at disadvantage for being restrained.Spurrier: Okay so- but spells though would be fine?Kyle: It doesn’t say…nothing about spells so yeah, you’re good on spells.Spurrier: Okay! Well I think to myself-Spurrier (as Randy): Hey, you in there! You annoying little gem you.Kyle (as Eddie): Yes? What?Spurrier: Oh boy.Spurrier (as Randy): Your life is at risk for this too because you currently need a vessel and if I die well, you know what happens to you. So, let’s make this one count okay?Kyle (as Eddie): You think I don’t already know that, Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): I’m just checking in; you’ve been testy lately![unsure]Spurrier (as Randy): Mhm.Spurrier: Alright so, I don’t lift up my shirt like-Spurrier (as Randy): You’re just gonna have to wriggle your way out if that’s cool-[All laugh]Kyle (as Eddie): I think we can make that work, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Appreciate it.Kyle (as Eddie): Team work makes the dream work, man.Spurrier: And I say-Spurrier (as Randy) [Distorted] Chromatic orb!Kyle: Okay, and you’re-Spurrier: I’ll cast it at a third level and make it all fiery.Kyle: Ooh, okay!Goodrich: It just comes out of your mouth.[Players laugh]Spurrier: Yeah-Goodrich: Like, chromatic or- [gags]Kyle: Yeah actually, Eddie comes out of your mouth and he’s just pushing the ball.[Goodrich laughs]Kyle: Just right out of your mouth.Goodrich: Yashee and I are just like, what the heeeeck!?Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is a seven plus three.Kyle: That does not- that does not quite hit.Spurrier: Hm.Kyle: That actually ends up flying off, you get wriggled around in the tentacle and as the ball escapes your mouth you actually end up being turned sideways to where your mouth is facing the roof and it shoots off into the roof.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, you cast from your tummy, remember?Spurrier (as Randy): Trying over here![Players laugh]Kyle: Yup.Ali (as Yashee): You didn’t practice that one!Kyle: Okay so, I'm going to do all the miners at once. I'm gonna put Whimpy up first and Whimpy grabs the tentacle around his waist and you just see him like, hulk out like Master Roshi style, super buff; and he grabs it and he just rips the tentacle right in half.Goodrich: Whoaa!Kyle: Like, pulls it off the body of this thing. You hear it screech and shreak. Whimpy's just standing there with this part of the tentacle and he’s swinging it around is head like- [Yelling] Yeah![Players laugh]Kyle: And I'm gonna say that’s the end of his turn. And Trish reaches behind her and you see her pull out this weird bag and it’s like, black and there's a little bit of dust floating out of it. And she takes a small stone, drops it in there, shakes it up and throws it right at the monster. It goes sailing past it but it ends up hitting the back wall and there’s just a small explosion of force. That’s gonna be her turn, and then Erin doesn’t do the same display that Whimpy did but she’s able to grab the tentacle and you know, works it around her body to where it’s off and she ends up dropping to the ground and she makes a bolt for the passageway. And she’s just like-Kyle (as Erin): Come on, ya’ll! We gotta get going this ain’t- [laughs] No![Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re working on it!Kyle: And we’re going to go to Raz’ul.Goodrich: Okay well, I'm going to try transforming into hopefully something super small to escape or something big and I'll bite-Kyle: We’ll see, yeah.Goodrich: So..Kyle: La-ti-do.Goodrich: [Chuckles and rolls dice] Oh good, twenty-three which is a goat![All chuckle]Goodrich: So-Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: I actually-Ali: A little bigger than you or?Goodrich: That doesn’t really help.[All laughing]Goodrich: It’s about the same size.Kyle: You turn into a goat!Goodrich: And I-Ali: Does the change and feel like freak the tentacle out a little bit enough to slip you out?Goodrich: No, I'm just gonna try again.Kyle: This was a [baa’ing] baaaaad choice.[All laugh]Goodrich: I’m gonna say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oopsies! Sorry guys uh, little misfire there. Kinda freaking out-Goodrich: [Rolls dice] it’s an eighty-three, which is a giant badger.[All laugh]Kyle: A giant badger! I think we’re about to dip into some other IP if we’re not careful.Goodrich: [Laughs] Yeah! So, I transform and say- Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I got it this time! [Yells and voice becomes deep and distorted] and I’m a giant badger.Kyle: What is the actual size of a giant badger?Spurrier: I’m very curious about that too.Kyle: I’m gonna have to-Goodrich: It’s a medium creature so-Kyle: Gosh dang, well since you Raz’ul are a medium creature and a giant badger is a medium creature you are still restrained.Goodrich: Yeaaaah.Kyle: And that’ll pretty much wrap up your turn since you used your bonus action to transform then your action to transform again and we are gonna go to the top of initiative with Yashee.Ali: Okay well-Kyle: What do?Ali: I want to grab my diminution potion. Kyle: [Amused] Okay, yes you have access to that.Ali: What are the effects of that again?Kyle: So, you received the reduce side of the enlarge/reduce spell so you’re pretty much moved to the next size down-Ali: Okay, okay-Kyle: And I think you have disadvantage on strength checks? Stuff like that, but your weapons shrink down with you so those are gonna be the same size and everything.Ali: Perfect.Kyle: But you pull out this potion and it’s a red liquid inside but like the red conforms down to a small tiny ball then expands back out filling up the clear liquid in the bottle.Ali: Okay, I'll pop that top and-[All laugh]Ali: Knock it back.Goodrich: Like, that’s weird! Glug, glug, glug.Ali: It just happens to be in my shirt pocket so I just kinda.Kyle: Yeah, you reach in and you start to shrink down. And this thing kind of starts to kinda tighten around you but i’m gonna say you slip right through as you’re shrinking down. And uh, I'll call that a- whatever, that's just drinking a potion.Ali: Okay, so I'm looking around and getting pretty upset. I don’t like- I don’t like getting grappled, I don’t like being held down and- cause I was like pushing to try and get out but it wasn’t letting, and I see my friends getting all grappled and everyone- no It's not happening. So, I'm gonna rage-Goodrich: And we’re in a cave.Ali: Yeah-Kyle: Well she’s smaller now so that might actually be better for you as far as the claustrophobia goes. Ali: It feel great for a second but I'm still-[All laugh]Ali: I think- I think the emotions are ramping up and so-Kyle: Right.Ali: Any certainty that I gained from being a little smaller is kind of taking a back seat.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: Alright to you’re going into a rage-Ali: I’m gonna go ahead and rage on top of my-Kyle: Sweet.Ali: Tiny Yashee Rage.Kyle: Alright, that’s like a bonus action for you so-Ali: Cool! Alright so-Goodrich: Tiny raging Yashee.Spurrier: Amazing.Ali: So, what I'm wanting to do is to kind of get to this eye and stab it. I take out a javelin and I wanna stab that right into it.Kyle: Mkay.Ali: How far am I from the eye?Kyle: It’s really not that far, you are right- you as a group are entering a passageway so it’s pretty much right there next to you so you almost don’t really even have to move at all.Goodrich: It just snatched us up.Ali: Yeah, alright I'm gonna use reckless attack again and that gives me advantage on melee using strength and then since I'm raging, I get a bonus roll to the damage on that.Kyle: Okay.Ali: [Mumbling, rolls dice]Goodrich: [Singing] Hidin’ in your caverns, snatchin’ your party up![All laugh]Ali: That’s a nine for the first one, rolling at advantage- [rolls dice] Alright so that’s an eleven plus three for the strength bonus and three for the proficiency bonus.Kyle: Okay yeah, that’s gonna hit.Ali: Sweet!Kyle: You go in and it’s not quite the hit you want, but you’re aiming for its eye but it’s mouth opens up like, “Hey are you gonna feed me something?”[Players chuckle]Kyle: And you end up stabbing into its mouth or so. Go ahead and roll that damage, which for a javelin is one d6 plus your strength.Ali: And then I get a plus two bonus.Kyle: Yeah, for that rage damage.Ali: So that is- ah! A six, plus three, plus two so eleven.Kyle: Eleven? Alright. So, you stab it in the top if it’s mouth and it rears back and you see it’s whole body kind of like, bend and you see it hit a little bit of the light from the drift globe and you can see there’s a large gash on the top of it that you didn’t notice before, and there’s like some weird green ooze coming out of it; and most of its body looks like it’s a little cracked and weird. So, anything else in your turn Yashee? You still have some movement left.Ali: Yeah, I think I'll just try to maybe try to get past it to be on the same side as Erin.Kyle: So, you run past it into the passage way and that’ll wrap up your turn. We’re gonna go to my monster. Who’s still wrapped up?Spurrier: Me.Goodrich: Me.Kyle: Randy, Raz’ul and Trish are still wrapped up by this thing and you three notice that there is a small nub where one of its tentacles was starts to kind of like, bubble and gurgle and flop and you see something sprout out and another tentacle comes back out.Goodrich: Oh jeez!Kyle: And replaces one that went missing.[Players groan]Kyle: And it’s trying to wiggle around and it actually moves its way into the passageway towards Yashee and Erin, but it comes up like just out of reach of where you are. It's the new one so it’s still kind of growing.Spurrier: Right.Kyle: But it keeps stretching and you know, you back away just a little bit before it touches you but keeps going.Ali (as Yashee): [Distorted voice] Haha! Yeah that’s right, what's up![All laugh]Goodrich: But it’s like you’re really small so like- [Distorted but higher pitch] “hahaha, what’s up!”Kyle: I was wondering about that earlier. It is also going to reel in Raz’ul, little badger, lookin’ at you-Goodrich: I'm a medium sized badger!Kyle: [Whimsical] What are you? To him you’re little.Goodrich: [Laughs] Okay.Kyle: And it’s gonna take a ch-ch-ch-chomp at ya.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: It brings you in and it’s going like, head first like it’s trying to chomp on you. It’s kinda feeling you out like, arg, doesn’t like the fur at first but you know, gives a couple good noms in to you.Goodrich: Gosh, it doesn’t feel like the dwarf I captured at first.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: What’s going on here?Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: Stop rolling!Kyle: Well you know it’s- eleven damage.Goodrich: Okay, well and I forgot to roll so I'm just gonna take thirteen so, woo, yay!Kyle: That’s fine!Spurrier: Just hanging on there.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Alright, we’re gonna move to Randy.Spurrier: Okay well, since Eddie didn’t do a very good job, I'm just gonna pull out my two daggers and just scream and start stabbing it repeatedly.Kyle: Okay, you’ll get your offhand attack and your main hand attack. So, both are gonna be at disadvantage.Spurrier: ‘Kay.Kyle: So, roll those for me.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] Goodrich: You’re just like Drax, like [yells][Kyle laughs]Spurrier: That is a seventeen and a five.Kyle: Oh.Spurrier: So, one of them is not going to hit. So, let’s see if I can get one in the game. Those are both tens so-Kyle: Okay but how much is your-Spurrier: A ten plus six.Kyle: That’s gonna hit.Spurrier: [Surprised] Oh!Kyle: That hits the tentacle.Spurrier: Phew, alright!Kyle: Go ahead and do your damage with one of your daggers.Spurrier: That is a one d4 plus three. [Rolls dice] And that is- that is a four.Kyle: Awesome so, seven? Yeah, your dagger just goes right through. Slices through the tentacle. It releases you and you drop; you have movement left.Spurrier: Yes, so I am gonna go over to where the others are.Kyle: Okay, you’re running?Spurrier: Yes, going and going.Kyle: There’s no shame.Spurrier: Randy has no shame so it’s fine.Kyle: That takes us to my miners and Whimpy was up first last time so he’s gonna be up first this time. He's gonna run over and grab the tentacle that’s holding Trish, and he’s just gonna grab it and he’s gonna- [growls] and totally just rips another one right out of there. He's just hulking and holding it up and he starts dragging Trish, still wrapped up in the tentacle, towards the passageway.Goodrich: Oh my gosh.Kyle: He just like- [grunts] over his shoulder like, stomping off.Spurrier: Awesome.Goodrich: Wow.Kyle: And Trish is just like-Kyle (as Trish): Yeah, I guess this’ll work alright.[All laugh]Kyle: And Erin is still gesturing everyone. She's actually moving, seeing the tentacle that came towards her and Yashee and she’s still moving further like-Kyle (as Erin): We need to keep moving further away, it’s still stretching!Kyle: That’ll wrap up the miners turn, now I need to know what my big badger boy is gonna do.Goodrich: [Laughs] Well first I'll say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep, distorted] Uh, don’t worry about me guys! I got this!Goodrich: It’s okay though, because I have a multi-attack which means I can make two attacks, one with my bite and one with my claws.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: And uh, yeah, I guess I'm gonna do that.Kyle: Go ahead and make those at disadvantage because you are restrained.Goodrich: [Rolls dice, sighs] Four um and eighteen. Oh nuts, that’ll be my bite.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: And then [rolls dice] twelve and [rolls dice] nineteen. So, twelve plus three to hit so fifteen for my claws.Kyle: That will hit.Goodrich: Alright! So, as a badger I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep, distorted] Hello from the magic badger!Kyle: Oh, god! This is what I was talking about![All laugh]Goodrich: I had to, I had to! I'm sorry! I bite down on it but then I realize it’s so nasty.Kyle: Yeah, yeah, it’s really hard- your teeth- maybe they don’t have what it takes to pierce this natural armor-Goodrich: Yeah-Kyle: On this thing-Goodrich: So, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep, distorted, sounding grossed out and spitting] Gross!Goodrich: But as I'm saying that I'm clawing at it really hard with my claws.Kyle: That does- like I said, that does work so go ahead and roll that damage.Goodrich: Two d4 plus one [rolls dice] four and four! Hey![All cheer]Goodrich: A big fat nine!Kyle: So, you try to bite it and- [mimics gnawing] no, no, but then you start slashing with your hands and you dig right through this tentacle and it screams and the tentacle falls to the ground, you fall to the ground and land on your feet, it unravels around you and you’re free. You're more than welcome to use your movement at this time if you’d like.Goodrich: Yes! I would absolutely like to use that movement and G-T-F-O.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Run towards everyone else.Kyle: Alright, so you get your way out of there.Goodrich: Yeah, I guess as a badger I scurry- [mimics scurrying]Kyle: [Laughs] Yeah, you scurry on out of there and you get a little bit closer towards the rest of the group who uh, we’re gonna go back to the top of initiative, it’s Yashee. That tentacle is still kind of moving towards you a little bit.Ali: But we’re all on the side of like, running away-Kyle: Running away, yeah absolutely.Ali: Alright, since I'm raging I might as well just [chuckles] play around a little bit. So, I'm just gonna take the tentacle and almost like I'm ringing out a towel-[Others chuckle]Ali: Like, twist it, like I'm trying to pull it apart.Kyle: Alright yeah, go ahead and give me a strength check.Ali: I don’t have advantage cause I'm like, smaller and then I'm raging so it kind of cancels each other out.Kyle: Yes, correct.Ali: So that’s be five plus three.Kyle: It’s wiggling around and you’re not able to get your hands on it you can't get your mitts on there.Ali: I’m having the hardest time-Kyle: I know.Ali: With this tentacle today.[Both chuckle]Kyle: But yeah, you still have movement left in your turn.Ali: So, I'll turn back and yell-Ali (as Yashee): [Deep, distorted] Let’s just get out of here!Ali: And i’m gonna use dash as my bonus action to go catch up with the group.Kyle: Okay yeah, cause that’s part of your path, right?Ali: Yeah, my lynx totem spirit.Kyle: Sweet, yeah so you dash on further into the passage. You’re pretty much scrambling around Erin who responds-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah that’s what I was saying! We just need to get on outta here![Players laugh]Kyle: Okay, and at this point- the one tentacle that just freshly bursted out- it's this monster turn again, and you hear that same sound of another tentacle pushing its way out of its body and coming free. And now you see three tentacles that are trying to slither towards you deeper into the passage way. [Rolls dice] Lemme see-Goodrich: [Makes a soft popping sound] That’s the sound it makes. [pop]Kyle: All of these slithering tentacles are sliding towards you, trying to swipe at each of you. Randy, it tries to get a grasp at you but it misses-Spurrier: Nope.Kyle: Raz’ul, you feel something try to get around your furry little leg-Goodrich: My tail like- [yells]Kyle: Yeah, you scamper out of it just in time. And the third tentacle tries to reach out but it hasn’t grown enough to be able to reach any of you so, and yeah, that pretty much takes up its turn. It wasn’t able to make a grab on anybody which leads us to Randy.Spurrier: Alright, in that case I'm just gonna dash as well.Kyle: Mkay, so you dash further down the passage way, following up Yashee. You scurry around Erin as she’s standing there still beckoning people, and that takes us to the miners. Trish eventually gets up, she’s just like-Kyle (as Trish): Okay, okay Whimpy we get it, you ain’t gotta do that.[Players laugh]Kyle: She stands up and she throws back the tentacle and she winds up just looking at it and laughing as the other tentacles grab onto it and start pulling it back. Erin keeps moving forward and is like-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I think we might almost be clear! Raz’ul come on- is that Raz’ul!?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep, distorted, yelling] I’m coming!Goodrich: But I jump into the air as a badger, dashing- you know, dashing badger.Kyle: Okay so-Goodrich: Raz’ul Dashing’sonKyle: You’ve dashed your way to safety. The tentacles like, one of them kind of like, nah that’s just another one of our tentacles. And you see it reaches a final edge where it’s not able to pursue you any further.Goodrich: Maybe as a badger I ran around in a bunch of circles and tied them a in a little knot? Cartoon style?Kyle: You don’t wanna try that.Goodrich: [Laughing] Okay.[All laughing]Kyle: If you wanna try you can.Goodrich: No!Kyle: Are you sure you want to do that?Goodrich: That’s what Raz’ul imagines he did cause I’m feeling all frisky as a badger.Kyle: That’s the story he’ll lie and tell people he did.Goodrich: Oh my gosh, yes.[All laugh]Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: I round the corner, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep, distorted] Yeah I took care of it, I tied them up in a little bow!Kyle: Okay, alright so, you make your way further down this oddly smooth-Goodrich: Wait, wait, wait, whoa-ho, whoa there!Kyle: Yeah? You're done, battles over.Goodrich: So- and since we’re done, I'm going to transform out of a giant badger.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Deep groaning voice turns back to normal and laughs] That was crazy, guys!Kyle: Alright-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, so I've got this spell that I can use to maybe prevent that- that Goodrich my stupid-Kyle: Handler.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [laughs] Yeah, the extension of my psyche- he said I got this spell, you guys probably know it, pass without trace.Goodrich: And I’m gonna cast that real quick. Probably should have done that before we got into this mess, that one’s on me.Spurrier: Well-Goodrich: Here we go, poof! Disappear into the shadows.Kyle: Alright-Goodrich: [Gruff voice] I am the night.Ali: I’m gonna go ahead and do some deep breathing and try to get out of my rage.Kyle: Okay.Ali: The potion is still in effect, right?Kyle: Yes, but for how long we did not figure out so go ahead and roll me a d4 to see how many hours this will last.Ali: [Rolls dice] Oh it’s a two!Kyle: Two! Alright, so we got two hours of tiny Yashee.[Players laugh]Ali: Sweet.Goodrich: Hurray!Ali: Am I still taller than these guys?Kyle: You’re taller than- you're taller than Randy but shorter than Raz’ul.Goodrich: [Excited] Oh!Kyle: You like, split the difference.Spurrier: Weird, nice.Ali: This’ll be fun.Goodrich: Split right in the middle.Spurrier: This’ll be awesome.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So, I guess when I transform out I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa! What happened to you?Ali (as Yashee): [Higher voice throughout] I drank the diminution potion guys![All laugh]Ali (as Yashee): I’m little like you are now!Goodrich: Yay!Ali (as Yashee): This is so cool! I'm always having to duck and stuff and it’s like, the world was made for me!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you feel better now? Maybe like the cave isn’t closing in on you as much?Ali (as Yashee): Oh yeah, this corridor is very spacious.[All chuckling]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Good. High five! Cause we can now!Ali: [Imitates a sound as if hands clapping together]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Kyle: Great success. Alright, since you cast pass without a trace are you trying to move stealthy from here on out?Goodrich: Yes-Spurrier: I assume we should all roll-Goodrich: Oh, my goodness-Spurrier: Roll for stealth-Kyle: Gimme those stealth checks.Spurrier: And that’s a plus ten to stealth and dex stuff right?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Goodrich: Cause yeah, it’s a level two.[Multiple dice rolling]Spurrier: That is an eighteen, plus nine, plus ten-[All chuckle]Spurrier: That is a thirty-seven.Kyle: Sure.Goodrich: He disappear into air.Ali: And I got a sixteen.[All chuckle]Kyle: Not bad![All laugh]Goodrich: Welp, I got a two-Kyle: Mhm.Goodrich: Thankfully plus ten, plus jack of all trades so that’s thirteen.Kyle: Alright, let me see how those miners do since they’re taking queue. [Rolling dice] okay..Goodrich: I let them all know.Kyle: Oh yeah.Goodrich: I got you guys.Kyle: Okay, so you stealthily make your way down the rest of this passageway. It's rather oddly smooth but you know, it makes for easy travel.Goodrich: A bunch of smooth criminals over here.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely. It winds its way-[Goodrich chuckling]Kyle: Good job. It winds its ways before opening into a much larger underground cavern. And when I say large, I mean [with emphasis] large.Goodrich: Awesome!Kyle: You only see about sixty feet provided by the drift globe’s glow and then it dips off into darkness but you notice there is that slight bioluminescence that is on the walls around you.Spurrier: Does it have the same pattern as it did before?Kyle: No, it looks a little bit more natural.Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: In characteristics.Ali: Are we near the walls? Like, is it close enough to touch?Kyle: Yeah, you could touch it.Ali: I take a sniff.[All chuckle]Kyle: Yeah, it smells wet and also you notice as you’re- as you’re smelling it, you breathe in and it’s really humid in this room. It's a lot more humid than the last room you were in. But off in the distance you hear a lapping against a shore line, there’s water just cresting against it. And then you hear the sound of running water that you heard earlier but it’s a little bit louder and it is further into the room, what are you gonna do?Spurrier: Uh-Ali: I’m sniffing the wall.[Players laugh]Goodrich: I say- [laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, you find anything?Ali (as Yashee): I’m seeing what it might be from, it doesn’t smell-Kyle: Smells mossy.Ali: Mm, okay well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Erin- [Laughs] I’ll let you sniff-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah? What’s going on, Raz’ul?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Does this look normal to you?Kyle (as Erin): I mean, sometimes caves have bioluminescence. Just depends on what’s going on down here. It's humid down here, we’re pretty deep so, I reckon we might be near some volcanic activity-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh boy.Kyle (as Erin): So, we might need to be careful where we tread but-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Is there anything else like, maybe being in a volcano that we should know before [chuckles] before we keep going? Like is there any more stalagmites that might kill us?Kyle (as Erin): [Chuckles] I don’t know, I've never seen anything like that before. I mean, there’s crazy critters that habit caves and stuff but I've never been this deep so I- god knows what we might find.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay.Kyle (as Erin): We just gotta be ready, I mean that last one just kinda got a jump on us, didn’t it?[Players chuckle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Not so much jump as try to eat.Spurrier: Well, I guess we head towards the water now that we’re all being sneaky.Kyle (as Erin): That sounds like a plan, we can sneak on over there.Kyle: So, you sneak on further.[Goodrich and Spurrier hum the Pink Panther theme]Kyle: Sneaking, so sluthey.Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle: Alright, but you get over there and you get a little bit further in. For some reason you notice there’s a well-worn path. Stalagmites, stalactites, there’s columns and you know, different cavernous displays that I didn’t take the time to research and actually know.[Players laugh]Kyle: But straws are apparently one of them.Goodrich: A giant beautiful cave underground.Kyle: It’s fantastic!Spurrier: That’s right.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely! You eventually get to a cross roads and this is where you actually come into contact with the stream of water, and you notice that it’s flowing from left to right. You look to your left and it dips off into darkness, to the right you can see the edge of what looks like a hut-Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: Of some sort.Goodrich: Marceline![All laugh]Goodrich: Just kidding!Ali: Does it look like anyone's in the hut? Is there any light coming from it or?Kyle: You can’t see anything, no.Goodrich: No vampire queen?Kyle: You don’t see anything other than the bioluminescence that is just natural to this cave. You don’t notice anything other than the hut and the stream and the sound of the water that’s lapping against the shoreline, it’s a little bit louder now.Goodrich: So, I turn to the miners and I say-Kyle: They’re looking around and they’re studying, taking in this opportunity. They're very enamored with this area you know like, taking pieces of rock with them that they find-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: And stuff like that-Goodrich: Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Basom-ites, check out- there's a hut over there, do you guys know anything about someone who may be living down here? Does Jermaine have a vacation house down here or something? [chuckles]Kyle (as Erin): Is Jermaine that one guy that uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, that dude that went missing-Kyle (as Erin): Oh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And we’re kind of looking for him, kind of looking for how this whole situation got started. Kinda looking for Jenny-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, so there’s a hut over there, he might be inside.Kyle (as Erin): Well, I mean if ya’ll wanna check it out, I mean that’s one person we could find that’s gone down this hole.Ali: Are there windows we could peek in?Goodrich: Yeah, let’s go up there and peek in the windows.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Do we need to do a fresh stealth or are we still stealthy?Kyle: Nah, we’ll hold onto the stealth checks.Goodrich: I mean, do I have to stealth check? Cause I didn’t roll very good.Kyle: You can try again.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: You can keep yours or roll again depending-Goodrich: I’m rolling again! I roll a six, so-Ali: Plus- is that the plus ten?Goodrich: Plus ten, plus one so I got seventeen.Ali: Mine was like..Kyle: You had a sixteen before.Ali: Sixteen. [Rolls dice] Okay, seventeen plus ten.Kyle: There you go, alright. So yeah, you’re moving a little bit more stealthily now that you’ve you know, figured out the lay of the land a little bit better. And you’re moving closer and you notice that it’s getting a little bit warmer as you get closer to where this shoreline sound is coming from.Goodrich: Mhm.Kyle: So you sneak your way up to this hut and you can actually see that it’s not just this hut that’s around the area, it’s more like a shanty town of sorts that’s just filling up this area to the shoreline and you can see where the edge of the land just dips off and there’s a little bit of water that’s cresting over it. But the creek that you had found actually goes off and falls off making a little water fall, you can’t really see that but you know it happens.Goodrich: Right, we can hear it.Kyle: So, you’re up to this hut, what do you wanna do now that you snuck your way up there?Goodrich: There’s light coming out of it?Kyle: No.Goodrich: No lights on?Kyle: There’s no light on.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: There’s no light other than the light from the drift globe.Goodrich: Ah, this was an ancient civilization. This was the first Basom.[All chuckle]Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: How many Basoms are there? Basom, Not-Basom, First Basom. Um, go inside the house?Spurrier: Yeah, I mean I guess so. There's lots of them.Goodrich: And are the Basom-ites with us? The miners?Kyle: Yeah, they’re just kind of wandering around looking around. Goodrich: So, I turn to them-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): This is all new to you guys, this seemingly underground civilization we found.Kyle: They’re all looking through a window and all just turn over the shoulder and nod.Goodrich: [Laughs] Okay.Goodrich: Welp, let’s go check it out, let’s go in the house.Kyle: Why not?Spurrier: We’re being all stealthy, might as well try.Kyle: You slip through the little flap that’s acting as a door.Goodrich: okay.Kyle: And you see inside it’s a basically little set up like, a cot, a small table, some old fish that’s been eaten, partially.Goodrich: How old's the fish, Kyle?Kyle: You wanna take a smell check?Goodrich: [Laughing] Yeah, can we do a-Kyle: No, you know it smells bad.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: It does not smell good, smells like somebody ate it a couple days ago, maybe.Goodrich: Oh, so it’s semi-fresh then. It's not like a fish bone skeleton that’s been-Kyle: Yeah, I mean the heads still connected to it like- you know they left it like the cartoon style with the fish and the head and the tail-Goodrich: But this is recently noshed by someone.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: I turn to all the miners-Spurrier (as Randy): Guys, when did the meteor hit? How long has it been?Kyle (as Erin): It’s been about a week.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, well, there probably were people here then and I'm guessing something from the meteor maybe came in here? All the stuff on the walls and- who knows who was here but they’ve probably been here awhile.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe all those jackal fellers that we saw were living down here and they escaped to the ruins.[Someone chuckles]Spurrier (as Randy): Well, someone was but something drove them off looks.Kyle: At this time, you hear a large splash come from the shore line- No! Not that splash!Goodrich: I was about to say-[All laugh]Goodrich: He took a big potion! Like, “I’m Splash!”Kyle: There’s a- [laughs] yeah, yeah he did. No, but you hear a large Splash and it sounds like something lands on the shoreline and you just hear this- [choking gasping]Goodrich: Uh oh.Spurrier: Let’s investigate!Goodrich: Let’s go!Ali: Let’s go check it out!Goodrich: Do we need to roll for investigation or can we just go look at it?Kyle: You can just go look at it if you want to.Spurrier: We’re looking at it then.Kyle: Alright, so you go, you look at it and you see like, you see this creature hunched over a little bit and it stands up-Goodrich: It’s Gollem-Kyle: And- [chuckles] yup![Players laugh]Kyle: And- that's what I'm trying to avoid here.Goodrich: [Laughing] Right!Kyle: You have caught me good sir! No, this creature like stands up and- let's see, [rolls dice, gasps] and it’s like looking around and you see it’s- it kind of looks like a fishy-looking head. Big fishy eyes and where it’s mouth would be you see these tentacles just hanging. The rest of it’s body had smooth skin and it’s wearing a tunic of sorts. But it has smooth skin and you see it like grabbing around it’s throat and like, reaching out and just looking around for anything and doesn’t say anything, but keeps- [choking and gasping]Goodrich: I run up- can I run up and push it in the water? Without- it sounds like a catfish person and they somehow got out of the water, I just wanna push them in real quick.Kyle: Okay!Goodrich: Dummy, you go in the water!Kyle: Run and give me a strength check.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] It’s a seventeen plus three, twenty.Kyle: You push it back in the water and it falls in there. And it’s floundering around and it reaches up towards the side and it sees you, cause you just attacked it-Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So it sees you and it’s reaching out towards you.Goodrich: [Panicked] Okay, I grab it’s hand, or whatever it is he’s holding out to me.Kyle: It’s like a little claw hand with like four fingers.Goodrich: Oh jeez, okay yeah I grab it and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, sorry there bud I thought maybe you needed water- fish sort of thing-Kyle: And it-Goodrich: I pull him out-Kyle: You pull him up and they’re grabbing your hand and looking at you with desperation as they clutch their throat.Goodrich: Okay, I do the Heimlich maneuver of course! That's what all little dwarves learn!Kyle: Okay you do the Heimlich maneuver? Go ahead and give me a strength check.Goodrich: [Sighs] Oh boy. [Rolls dice] Nope, four plus three, seven.Kyle: You get your hands around their body and it’s like, slippery and it’s hard to get a good grip.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hold still, jeez!Kyle: And then you see it like, lunging forward. Yashee and Randy, you just see Raz’ul push this person in, pull them out, start giving them the Heimlich maneuver, are you doing anything at this point?Spurrier: Um..Goodrich: And I’m over there still like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Grunting] Hold still I'm trying to- [grunts] come on now, I'm trying to help now-[Players chuckle]Ali: I’m gonna go over and try to help.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Maybe I’ll stand in front and you know like, grab your arms with my arms and we’ll-[All laugh loudly]Ali: Try to push together to Heimlich-Goodrich: We’ll put him in the middle of the sandwich and we can pop whatever-Ali: Exactly!Goodrich: In his throat straight up in the air!Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Just as a backup plan, Randy kind of gets the gist of what you’re trying to do and I- I'm just gonna do a running punch.[Ali laughs]Spurrier: I’m gonna punch him right in the gut.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, grab one arm-Spurrier (as Randy): Guys, check this out!Kyle: So, everybody give me a strength check at advantage.Goodrich: Okay-[Multiple dice rolling]Goodrich: I’ve rolled three fours in a row!Kyle: Err?Goodrich: Err, is right!Ali: Uh, sixteen plus three.Kyle: Sixteen plus three.Goodrich: Four plus three.Kyle: Alright.[Angelic chorus of “Oh yeah” plays]Kyle: Oh yeah![Players laugh]Kyle: Okay so, Raz’ul you’re still having a little bit of trouble, but Yashee comes up and kind of like, does like a front squeeze and realizes, you ain’t got this and moves around to-Goodrich: You just push me into the water like, get outta here!Kyle: Yeah. So Yashee, you give a nice push and at the same time Randy, you just run forward- Bam! Fist right into the stomach, and as you punch, the tentacles just fly out of this things mouth-[Goodrich groans in disgust]Kyle: And there is just a squid that lands on the ground. You hear it gasping for air like- [gasping and choking]Kyle (as Fish Man): [Higher pitched and nasally, speaks gibberish]Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier: Oh.Goodrich & Spurrier: Uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Yashee?Goodrich: This is the squid talking?Kyle: No, this is the fish man talking.Spurrier: Oh!Goodrich: There’s a squid on the ground that’s not talking.Kyle: Yeah, the squid is not talking.Spurrier: Both of you have means of communicating, he’s like a fish person, maybe-Ali: I have comprehend languages.Spurrier: You have talk with animals.Goodrich: So, is the squid making noise?Kyle: No, it’s just lying there on the ground. It looks like It has a bite mark in it.Goodrich: Okay, how about the fish person? What are they doing?Kyle: They’re standing there and they’re looking at you three and they kind of bow and you know, make a kindly gesture and they keep saying stuff you know, and they end it by saying-Kyle (as Fish Man): Ker umfashure umva nic?Goodrich (as Fish Man): Nope, didn’t get any of that.Ali: Um-Kyle: And it begins writing this on the ground, this phrase that it’s saying- ‘Ker umfashure umva nic?’Kyle: And Raz’ul do you speak elvish? Does anybody speak elvish?Goodrich: I speak elvish.Kyle: Okay- do you speak elvish?Spurrier: Uh-uh.Kyle: Okay, so Raz’ul you can tell it’s actually written in elvish script what this person is saying is says, ‘God behind the door’Goodrich (Raz’ul): God behind the door? Is that what you’re saying?Kyle: And it looks and it nods and it says- Kyle (as Fish Man) Err- one second-Kyle: I mean-[Players laugh]Kyle: It didn’t say that! It doesn’t say one second, it holds up a finger and it goes over and it gets into this clay and starts building what looks like a ziggurat and places it on the ground in front of you. They start chanting out certain words and phrases you still don’t understand; and then it just stomps on the ziggurat.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: And you see orange magical material start to weave out from under it’s foot. It shoots out and goes into it’s mouth, you see that figure reel back and then comes forward and is just like-Kyle (as Fish man): [Sniffs, nasally] Did it work?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh! There it is, yeah!Kyle (as Fish man): Hi! I-I’m Gil.[Players chuckle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Gil!Kyle (as Gil): Thanks for saving my life.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, sorry about the confusion earlier, I thought you were some sort of squid person and that you just like, beached yourself essentially-Kyle (as Gil): Oh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And had to go back in the water. My bad.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Gil): That’s okay, so I gotta know, are you believers or heretics?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa, that’s kind of a big questions, also one I don’t understand.[All chuckle]Kyle (as Gil): Well I mean, do you- the God behind the door, do you believe or are you like the surface person that came down recently?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, so I don’t know if this is-Kyle (as Gil): The first surface person.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Who’s that? Surface person?Kyle (as Gil): Oh, there was a girl that uh, it was a little bit after the big crash that shook everything up but the girl looked terrible. She came in and we took her in-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): ‘Kay.Kyle (as Gil): Gave her a place to stay while she healed, I guess. She never really healed though but the high priests really seem to take a liking to her and she claimed to be you know, the god behind the door returning. I couldn’t believe that, that’s just not how the stories go.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Spurrier (as Randy): Right, can you give us one second?Kyle (as Gil): Oh- oh yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Hang on. Guys?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-huh?Spurrier (as Randy): So-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, I've never heard of that before.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah but, Jenny, right? I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh-Ali (as Yashee): I mean, it could be.Spurrier (as Randy): The dream. Missing. Uh, the thing that talked in the dream? Possibly.[Ali and Goodrich approve softly]Spurrier: Should we just say yeah, we’re cool with this person so we can see what’s up?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah I mean, I don’t wanna disrespect their fishy ways but yeah let’s see what we can find out at least.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Good point, though.Spurrier: Um-Goodrich: Break!Spurrier: Back over to Gilly.Kyle (as Gil): Hi!Spurrier (as Randy): Hey.[Players laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Yes, three checkmarks.Kyle (as Gil): Oh okay, well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe a little bit more interested in what it is? Maybe you can let us know more about what you’re talking about?Kyle (as Gil): Well yeah, the girl, she started talking to the high priest and then convinced him you know, she’s the god behind door returned home and she was gonna be able to take him through the door in our holy place. And I-Kyle: He like, spits on the ground at this point-Kyle (as Gil): I can’t even believe they would take her to our holy place, an outsider and a heretic like that but I- I don’t know, but she took all my friends and family and they had just all believed her. I got a strong brain, I know how things work, I remember the teachings and I couldn’t believe somebody like that. So, I wound up coming back one time from fishing and everyone was gone. Ali (as Yashee): So, they went to the holy place?Kyle (as Gil): I mean, that’s what she said she was gonna do. Take them all to the holy place through the door.Ali (as Yashee): So, where’s that?Kyle: And he kind of looks at you a little bit, he says-Kyle (as Gil): Well, I mean, I'd just be as bad as them if told you or took you there but-Spurrier (as Randy): What if we could help get your friends and family back?Kyle: And he kind of tilts his head and is just like-Kyle (as Gil): Mm? Well I do miss them, it’s been pretty lonely down here these- I don’t know how long.[Players laugh]Kyle: There’s no concept of day or night down here.Goodrich: I was gonna say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): How do you tell time there?Kyle (as Gil): I count the speckles on the wall.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Gil): That way I can tell time is half past a speckle.Goodrich: I turn to you guys-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Mumbling] Strong brain, okay.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Gil): Well you know I am one of the ones training to be a priest, that how I at least know the spell to talk to you guys, thank god. You know I was thinking about maybe trying to use it but I'm surprised it worked on the first try. You know what, if I tell you what, if you’re gonna help me get my friends and family back I can take you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Kyle (as Gil): Actually we’re just gonna follow this creek right up to it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ah, good, it just keeps expanding and expanding what we’re doing- Goodrich: How are the three miners taking in all of this?Kyle: They’re a little like, caught besides themselves. They’re just sitting there like, mouths agape like, uh..huh?[Players laugh]Goodrich: How does this fish person look? I mean, does it just look like a humanoid?Kyle: Yeah, it looks like a humanoid wearing- it's silver bodied, their head looks like a fish that kind of comes up- it's not like straight up. You know, their heads scaly like a fish, they have big fish eyes, sharp teeth, but the rest of their body is very humanoid looking. They have like a four fingered clawed hand, and you know, clawed feet that are webbed and you know those look like smooth skin-Goodrich: Okay-Kyle: More like a-Goodrich: We can assume that-Kyle: A shark kind of skin.Goodrich: Okay, we can assume that this is an amphibious person.Kyle: Yes-Goodrich: They are, okay.Ali: Like a SpongeBob character.Goodrich: Right, I was gonna say, there were ripped fish at the Punch Bowl-Kyle: That’s true.Goodrich: So it could have been them.Kyle: Could have been.Goodrich: Yeah, okay, welp-Spurrier: Let’s go!Goodrich: Yeah so, lead the way I suppose.Kyle: Alright so, you follow Gil up the source of the water for a ways and it leads through a passage before opening up to a grotto. In front of you is a fairly large stone door that is adorn with intricate carvings on it. The door has a large stone border around it and on this border you notice there’s a stone on the right side of the door that has some markings on it. There's something different about it but you’re not quite sure what it is. On the ground next to where that stone is on the border there is a good-sized stone that sits there, and it has actually been turned into an altar of sorts with different gifts and things placed upon it. You notice there are other altars around what seems to be this primary altar. These are all filled with fish, shiny stones, and other smelly odd offerings; and you notice that the source of water is actually coming from under the door.Goodrich: [Surprised] Oh!Kyle: And Gil turns to you and says-Kyle (as Gil): This is our holy place, we put up offerings to appease the god behind the door. Our high priests, they do a ritual of sorts and just try to appease the god into opening the doors so that we can go to our promise land. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay. What's the ritual?Kyle (as Gil): Well, the ritual is typically- they take a fish offering and eat it in front of the door and then they dance around for a little bit and shout out the name- [gibberish] and that’s what we’ve been told will eventually bring the god to open it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But it has never worked?Ali (as Yashee): For fifty generations?Kyle (as Gil): No, I mean maybe we’re just not ready yet?Spurrier (as Randy): How important is the door staying intact? Like is it more important getting past the door? Does the door need to still be there once it’s open?Kyle (as Gil): Well I-Spurrier (as Randy): How about you personally?Kyle (as Gil): Um, I mean if it gets my family back from the person who tricked them- I don’t even know she got past the door. I mean, I know before they left she was looking really weird but I don’t-Ali (as Yashee): What do you mean weird? What does that mean?Kyle (as Gil): Well, it looked like she’d been healing but then she started to get a little bit taller and like, her skin was tearing, separating in places. I dunno, it seemed like she was feeling better but not looking better.Spurrier (as Randy): Dream boy in there. Bad dream boys.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, Gil excuse us for one more second.Kyle (as Gil): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): So, we just need to get past this door, right? Isn't this really what this boils down to?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I think so.Spurrier (as Randy): So, we can just try to play something that would take care of the door.Ali (as Yashee): I think that’s fun.Spurrier (as Randy): We can probably weave something together-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We could just open the door-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s not the door itself, it’s what’s past the door. So, let’s just get rid of the door.[Players agree quietly]Spurrier (as Randy): Phew, all right Gil we got this!Kyle (as Gil): Oh- okay-Spurrier (as Randy): 1, 2, 3, 4![All chuckle]Kyle: Alright-Goodrich: I declare a door war!Kyle: So it sounds like we’re gonna roll some chord dice?[Players agree]Kyle: Let’s do that.[Electronic music plays]Kyle: Alright, let’s go to roll these dice but first, major or minor?[Someone inhales deeply]Ali: I’m thinking minor on this one.Goodrich: I am too, actually.Spurrier: Yeah, it just feels like it should be.Ali: So we need to bust down these doors and see what comes of it?Kyle: It helps that you have three miners with you.All: Ooooh!Kyle: [Softly] Let’s roll some dice and forget that ever happened.[Multiple dice rolling]Kyle: Did I get a wild again?Goodrich: You got a wild again, Kyle!Spurrier: Wow!Kyle: What is up!Spurrier: We should take you to Vegas.Goodrich: Seriously. Alright, so we got two D-minors, B diminished and F.Spurrier: And A-minor.Goodrich: And A-minor.Kyle: Huzzah, let’s get those drums figured out.[Coin hits the table]Ali: Alright, that’s tails, user bank. [Rolls dice] and that’s forty so Rock-43.Spurrier: Oh boy.Kyle: Sweet.Ali: And our kit- [rolls dice] Twenty- Mm- Twenty-six? Which is hex kit.Kyle: Oh!Goodrich: Sounds Magical!Ali: I don’t know what that means.Kyle: Six-piece wood sides.Goodrich: Okay, let’s do it!Kyle: Alright, get to writing![Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone, it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle, just wanting to thank you again for joining us.

If we open the door?Kyle (as Gil): You can open the door, yeah-Ali (as Yashee): [Yells] Let’s break it down![Upbeat drum beat begins, joined by the rest of the band to quick rock tune]Ali (singing): Toppling, tumbling  This door is now crumbling  Our rock is a force  That starts up the rumbling  These sound waves are striking it  Right at it’s core  We’ll crank it up louder All (singing) And open this door! Rock apart the rocks (x8)  Ali (singing) Knock it to the ground  We’re bringing it down  No doorway is safe  When the sauce is unbound  So get yourself ready  'Cause our sound is a force   All (singing): These beats are blowing up, and we are the source.  Rock apart the rocks (x8)[Synth solo]Rock apart the rocks (x16)[Music ends]Kyle: Alright Yashee, you grab your mallets with the intent to knock down this door with your beats, and you other two join in. Your instruments start to glow as you’re summoning the magic from it, and waves of energy are just rushing out towards the door and battering against it almost like a battering ram. The small room you’re in starts shaking as small pizzas- small pizzas-[All laugh]Goodrich: Small pizzas!Kyle: Small pizzas fall to the ground!Ali (as Yashee): Yes![All laugh]Ali (as Yashee): Perfect!Kyle: But small pieces of rock begin to fall and whatnot. The entire room is shaking and just barraging the door with your magic, over and over, and you get to the end of your song and it seems to just not be able to knock down this door or open it in any way shape or form.Ali: But we yelled so loud at the end.Goodrich: We were pretty clear-Kyle: You put in the effort, I understand.Goodrich: [Laughing] We were pretty clear with what we wanted to do.Kyle: Gil- Gill just kind of looks at you three and is like-Kyle (as Gil): Um, that’s an interesting ritual you got there.Kyle: Trish kind of like, moves him to the side-Kyle (as Trish): Alright let’s- [laughs heartily] let’s do this the old fashioned way!Kyle: And starts pulling out sticks of dynamite and starts laying them out- takes awhile, and when she’s about halfway through you hear a rumbling beginning.Goodrich: Uh oh.Kyle: And you hear stones sliding-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh Yashee, we’re done with the song, Yashee you can stop playing.[All laugh]Ali: It has to work, it has to work!Kyle: And as you’re joking about this, you feel a large gust of cold air come from the opening door.[Players gasp in shock]Kyle: It slides open-Goodrich: It did work!Kyle: And out walk, what looks like, a large group of other Gils. So, they all walk out in a group and there’s a shadowed figure behind them, and you hear in your head-Kyle (as Shadow Figure): Hello Yashe’rak Bordun, Raz’ul Daz’ul son, Randy Greentrees, Erin Copeland, Trish Shereen, and Alphonse Corea, and Gil it’s even good to see you again.Kyle: You notice at this point, the person behind the entire group of Gil like-looking people is very, very tall. They finally step into the light. They're wearing slightly armored robes and a cape with a large popped collar around an oddly shaped purple head with big pitched black eyes and four long tentacles that slither around its chest independently.Ali: More tentacles![Other players groan]Kyle: Yup, more tentacles.Goodrich: What’s with you, Kyle?Kyle: I dunno, maybe I'm doing foreshadowing?[All laugh]Goodrich: Maybe I’m trying to tell a story, Goodrich and shut your mouth!? [laughs]Kyle: So, this alien-like creature look at you-Goodrich: And I look back and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Knock, knock.Kyle (as Shadow Figure): I heard, it’s very nice to..meet you and..son of a king, hm.Ali (as Yashee): [Softly] Is that like a swear?[All laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, close your ears.Kyle (as Shadow Figure): I know your culture, if you’re anything like the surface dwellers from when we were first here there might be problems still yet for this planet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhhh, nah we’re just trying to get inside, help Gil out.[Players agreeing]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So uh, Gill you got this right bud? [Laughs] We’re gonna go keep looking for Jenny- just kidding!Kyle (as Shadow Figure): Oh!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m just messing with you Gil, we’re here for you.Kyle (as Shadow Figure): You’re looking for Jenny?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, hey- speaking of which-Kyle (as Shadow Figure): Look no further. For, I was Jenny.Spurrier (as Randy): And you are?Kyle (as Shadow Figure): Well, these people know me as the goddess behind the door. The name my own would call me would sound like- [slurping noises]All: Oh.Kyle (as Shadow Figure): But, if I were to say it in your tongue perhaps-Kyle: And you see this creature take an actual tentacle and slip it up under where its mouth would be, and it comes back out and you hear it actually talk in common.Kyle (as Shadow Figure): You can call me..Squid Vicious.[Players start laughing softly]Kyle: And we’re gonna go ahead and stop there![Players laugh loudly][Theme song plays]-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter"

Goodrich: [Singing] It’s episode seventeen!Goodrich & Kyle: [Singing] And you know what I mean!Goodrich: [Singing] And the way he looked was like a big’ol squid boy!Kyle: Yeah![All laugh][Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed. Thank you for joining us, let’s recap last episode real quick. So, last time the bards finally reached the bottom of the hole created by the meteorite and they found themselves in a small room of an underground cavin- cavern-Goodrich: Cavin!? [Laughs]Kyle: Cavern. When they ran into an old stalagmitey monster that impeded their path.Goodrich: Stagemitey, nice, yeah.Spurrier: Mmh!Kyle: You were able to make it past and run away which, listeners it’s very important to realize you can run away in D&D, and it might make the difference between life and death.Ali: We’re still new at this.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: You gotta learn.Goodrich: We did bravely run away.Ali: Yeah.Kyle: You bravely ran away.[Goodrich humming]Kyle: Just like somebody.[Snickering and humming]Kyle: So, at the end of the passage you found a larger cavernous area and this is where you met an odd little person who was choking on a squid. Luckily though through some teamwork you bards were able to get that squid out of there and save this strange person's life.Goodrich: Oh, Gil.Kyle: Yup, it was Gil! You found Gil, so-[Players chuckle]Kyle: And they let you know about how Jenny had come through and convince the rest of the tribe that she was able to get them past the door and that she was the god behind the door. So, Gil explained how the high priest used to do this ritual to try to entice the god to get them to open the door. Despite it having never worked it was something that they did and this door was supposed to lead them to paradise. He doesn’t know what Jenny did to get them passed the door but everyone else has been gone for quite some time. You as bards agreed to help Gil and-Goodrich: Do the only ritual that we know how to do!Kyle: That’s right! You tried to, you know, knock down the door with your bardic magic, but despite your best efforts, and I mean that, I really enjoyed the song.Goodrich: [Jokingly] Yeah sure, whatever.Kyle: Yeah okay, don’t believe me that’s fine-[Players laugh]Kyle: I’m just your trusting DM, right?Goodrich: You’re our farming DM like, “oh great job guys, hang on.”Kyle: Yeah let me get my parsnips, yeah no. I don’t play that parsnip game anymore, all hops and beer yo. [Quickly] Stardew Valley, get it.[Players laugh]Kyle: Anyway but, despite your best efforts you weren’t able to get the door open. Boom Queen started to do her thing but in the middle of setting up dynamite and whatnot the door actually began to open, and out walked a group of other Gils and a large alien looking creature that greeted you and the miners by name and introduced themselves as Squid Vicious. So-Goodrich: So, it's not Fishtus?Kyle: No, it’s not Fishtus.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Got it.Kyle: Not Fishtus, Squid Vicious.Goodrich: Yeah, I got you.Kyle: So-Goodrich: Real quick, before we start, Yashee is still tiny Yashee?Kyle: Yes, Yashee is still tiny Yashee.Goodrich: And as far as me- I cast pass without trace last time and it’s only been what? Five, ten minutes?Kyle: It’s been about ten minutes or so, say, you haven’t really- nothing's really broken your concentration.Goodrich: Okay yeah, I have concentration on it up to an hour.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So, great. We have to try to be hiding in order to-Kyle: Exactly.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: And right now you are not hidden, you are easily seen by this group of Gil looking like creatures and this alien looking creature. So, let’s just go ahead and start there.Goodrich: Phew! I thought you were gonna say, “so uh, let’s go ahead and start some initiative!”[All laugh]Kyle: Not quite.Goodrich: Not quite.Kyle: We’ll see what happens. So, you stand before this squid-faced creature with a gaggle of Gil’s in front of them and you know that feeling that you’ve had like somebody’s been looking over your shoulder?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Okay, that’s stronger than it ever has been so far.Goodrich: I look over my shoulder for posterity.Ali: Just once more.Kyle: No one is behind you, that is just us. Then you hear him switch over to speaking telepathically-Kyle (as Squid Vicious): Back here-Kyle: He points to his head.Kyle (as Squid Vicious): Sorry, that’s unnatural for me. Do you mind?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Mind? Uh, what?Kyle: And Squid coughs, and you see the forth tentacle resurface from underneath the other three, which they lift up from the cough and you can see a circular mouth.Goodrich: Like Zoidburgh?Kyle: A little bit, yeah![Players laugh]Kyle: [Imitating Zoidburgh] Why not? Come on everybody! You hear Squid’s voice continue in your head again.Kyle (as Squid Vicious): There, much better. Now, tell me what is it that brings you down he- oh! Right, it’s right there on the surface. You're looking for Jenny and trying to fix the source of water for the Oasis? In the desert town- the desert? There’s a desert up there? There shouldn’t be a desert up there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh? Yup, totally a desert.Kyle (as Squid Vicious): Interesting.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, hey.Goodrich: And I turn to the miners, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s always been a desert, right? I mean, you guys aren’t holding out on us right you? [chuckles]Kyle: Erin speaks up, she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): I mean, yeah! It's pretty much been a desert as long as we’ve been here.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup desert, one hundo percent desert up there.Spurrier (as Randy): Any reason it shouldn’t be a desert?Kyle (as Squid Vicious): Hm, well uh, when we were here this area was a jungle. To the north we had the ocean.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): And when was that?Kyle (as Squid Vicious): Many, many generations ago from when we first left this planet. We first left this planet when the blue moon was summoned by your ancestors. Something- what's that creeping in there? You've seen this happen. You found one of our Qualiths.Spurrier (as Randy): Qualith?Kyle (as Squid Vicious): It’s how we document certain aspects of our life. We use them for different purposes. It was a stone of sorts, or may have looked like stone.Goodrich & Spurrier: [Realization] Ooooh!Ali: The stone! The stone!Goodrich: The- [laughs] the stone! The stone! Says tiny Yashee. [Imitating Yashee] The stone! The stone!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you know anyone named Jirah? She had one of those.Kyle (as Squid): I do not know-Ali (as Yashee): She was from Not-Basom.Goodrich: Yeah she- [laughs]Kyle (as Squid): Okay?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): There’s another town a little bit further north from here, mostly ruins now, maybe, could have been jungle, I don’t know. But they had one of those stones and we all touched it and was lights out for us for a little awhile.Kyle (as Squid): That makes sense. That’s actually one of our surface colonies that we were able to shadow run. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, yup it’s full of jackals.Ali (as Ali): Whoops.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well really now it’s full of-Ali (as Yashee): A bunch of ruins.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, don’t worry about it. Anyways, yeah so we saw a couple of moons.Goodrich: I mean, the moon is up there right?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So the moons is still a real thing that is in the real sky? Not in some vision?Kyle: No, no yeah, it’s then- when you had the vision you realized that moons still around.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, the moon’s still around, it’s up there. Not a while lots changed other than Jenny’s gone and the meteor crashed down here and that is why we’re here.Kyle (as Squid): Yes, you think it’s a meteor, right. How quaint. Well perhaps- I guess a summoning of that blue moon was more detrimental to the planet than I thought.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean-Kyle (as Squid): I wonder how people even survived. It's- Mm..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I was never good at history.Goodrich: How tall is this dude?Kyle: They probably stand about seven foot or more.Goodrich: Aw, that was old Yashee height.[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Do you look at it and say, “aw I miss it.”Ali: Like, wow must be nice up there.Goodrich: [Chuckles] I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, Squidward? Err-[All laugh loudly]Goodrich: Squid Vicious?Kyle: Squid Vicious.Goodrich: Does he play-[All sigh like Squidward]Goodrich: Does he play a clarinet, Kyle?Kyle (as Squid): What’s a clarinet?Goodrich: Yeah, anyways-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Squid, hang on one sec.Goodrich: And I kind of look behind you, Randy, and I lift up your shirt-[Players laugh]Goodrich: I lift up the back of your shirt to see if your little glowy thing is activating more hard core than it is.Spurrier: I mean, I can’t see it-Kyle: You turn around-Goodrich: Looking at me, yeah-Kyle: You don’t see anything happen.Goodrich: Oh. And I put your shirt back down.Spurrier: Put your finger in it?Goodrich: Oh yeah, I do that too.Spurrier: Thank you.[All chuckle]Goodrich: Ugh, this has a feel.Ali: I mean if you’re gonna go back there.Goodrich: Yeah!Spurrier: When in Rome, yeah.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Squid): Interesting, I have to say I'm curious as to why you’re referencing the splashes on-Goodrich: Yup, yup-Kyle (as Squid): Symbols -Goodrich: Splash, he’s up there too.Kyle (as Squid): The symbol’s on Randy’s back.Goodrich: Symbol, also up there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, no that’s whenever we meet someone new [softly] it’s sort of a customary greeting we have. Lift up the shirt, poke the back, nice to meet you.Kyle (as Squid): Surface dwellers have changed after eons. Well, it’s a shame that not all of us made it considering there is a Qualith left here that documents that terrible event. But, I suppose it’s best we got out of there when we could.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah but you’re down here now.Kyle (as Squid): Yes, we have returned.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle (as Squid): We’ve come back to see if-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, you came in the asteroid, or meteor is what you’re saying.Kyle (as Squid): Sure, meteor, yeah. No, it’s not a ship we could have ridden in on.Goodrich: [Laughing] ‘Kay-Kyle (as Squid): It’s a ship.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, can we see it? Is that cool?Ali (as Yashee): It’s a rock-et ship?Kyle (as Squid): Maybe.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Rock-et-Ali (as Yashee): Rock..et ship.Kyle (as Squid): What’s a rocket ship?Ali (as Yashee): You know, like a meteor, rocky materials?Kyle (as Squid): Oh I see.Ali: I was making a joke [chuckles][All laugh, overlapping conversation]Kyle (as Squid): Sorry, humor is not quite my forefront.Goodrich: Forte, missed it again, Kyle.[Players laugh]Kyle: Oh, too bad I'm playing a character-Goodrich: [Laughing, jokingly] Too bad I'm trying to roleplay with you jerks in here!Kyle (as Squid): Tell me, I'm curious and I want to know if you happen to be- [slurping sounds] curious too.Kyle: And you see when he says curious their tentacles kind of quiver a little bit.[Someone shutters]Kyle (as Squid): I’m sure you’re wondering why your song may not have worked on the door. You may- you seemed pretty confident when you started off. Curious as to why?[Goodrich and Spurrier hesitantly say yes]Ali (as Yashee): I mean, we’re still learning.[Players laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): We did rock those rocks.Ali: Yeah.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Yes.Ali (as Yashee): Getting better all the time.Kyle (as Squid): Unfortunately, you see we do not rely on magic to complete our tasks, we rely on our minds. And when something is made of the mind, only the mind can open it. The mind is magic enough for us, and magically delicious too.[Players chuckle]Kyle: You see his tentacles quiver again a little bit.[Goodrich shutters]Kyle: And Squid looks at Yashee.Kyle (as Squid): You..I expected you to be..taller?Ali (as Yashee): I normally am.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, she’s kind of like the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the bards.Ali (as Yashee): Can we- give me a little bit of time, I'll be ready.Kyle (as Squid): Okay, well that’s-Ali (as Yashee): Then we can talk face to face up there.Kyle (as Squid): That’s fine, size doesn’t change what’s in the mind.Kyle: Yashee, go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw.Goodrich: Oh boy.[Dice rolls]Goodrich: Nailed it.Ali: That’s a fifteen.Kyle: It looks at you and goes-Kyle (as Squid): Hm, a thicker skull than I thought, that’s fine.Ali: I knock on my head a bit-[Players laugh]Goodrich: Dunk, dunk.[laughter]Kyle (as Squid): Well, okay then.Goodrich: [Imitating Yashee] I’m a barbarian-Ali (as Yashee): It’s just right, I think.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Squid): Randy, I'm curious how they fit so much inside of you. Your mind is a busy one.Ali (as Yashee): He’s bigger on the inside![Players chuckle]Kyle (as Squid): Oh, I can imagine.Kyle: Randy, give me a wisdom saving throw.Spurrier: Oh boy. [Rolls dice] That is a ten plus one.Kyle: Mkay. Randy, you hear in your head- I mean, everyone hears this, again, speaking telepathically.Kyle (as Squid): Randy, why haven’t you gone back home? What’s stopping you?Spurrier (as Randy): Um, well.. I don’t think I- well, I don’t know this but I feel like I wouldn’t be welcome?Kyle (as Squid): Hm.Spurrier (as Randy): Better to be out on the road then have to worry about facing..that.Kyle (as Squid): Mkay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, but he’s got us now! So you know, it’s all good.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah! Exactly!Kyle: Squid looks at Randy and says-Kyle (as Squid): I guess it’s whatever you gotta tell yourself to keep going, huh?Spurrier (as Randy): Y-yes.Kyle (as Squid): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Yes, yeah.Kyle (as Squid): Who is uh, who is this that’s joining us? Is that? Eddie, is it?Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, yeah that’s his shorthand. It's Eddie Izzard the Gizzard Wizard, if you want to be formally-Goodrich: [Laughing] Introduced.Spurrier: Yeah, exactly!Kyle (as Squid): That is a very interesting name to give it.Kyle: At this point, everyone hears Eddie begin to speak. Meaning like, Yashee and Raz’ul you can hear Eddie, and Eddie is talking to Randy specifically. You hear Eddie-Kyle (as Eddie): Hey buddy, I uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Screaming]Kyle (as Eddie): I uh, don’t like this guy-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s what Eddie sounds like!?Kyle (as Eddie): You need to do something here before I do or neither of us are gonna be able to do much of anything. Catch my drift?Ali (as Yashee): No wonder you keep giving in. That’s-[Players chuckle]Ali (as Yashee): I don’t like that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No way dude.Ali (as Yashee): Ugh, I do not like that.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, so Eddie- wait, oh. Why? Do you care to elaborate?Kyle (as Eddie): I just- I don’t- there’s something I don’t trust about this guy. I mean-Kyle: And you hear Squid say-Kyle (as Squid): Eddie, why don’t you say hello? Everyone is listening.Kyle (as Eddie): [Growing nervous] See, this is what I'm talking about man! This guy’s weird and I'm not talking I mean like, I'm weird man but he’s way-Ali (as Yashee): Pot calling the kettle over here, jeez![All laugh]Kyle: And Squid pops up-Kyle (as Squid): Eddie, I’m not going to hurt anyone yet but I do wonder if I can see where you’ve been.Kyle: Squid looks to be concentrating intently towards you, Randy. And Randy, you begin to hear Eddie scream. In fact, you all begin to hear Eddie scream. Randy, it feels like someone is-Goodrich: You wanna, you wanna give us a little-Ali: What you got there?Goodrich: Give us a little-Kyle (as Eddie): [Screaming in pain]Kyle: And it feels like someone is writhing around inside of you, Randy and it causes a mild discomfort in your tummy.[Players gasp]Ali: Oh no!Kyle: You begin to feel nauseous and on the verge of vomiting when you feel something inside you snap. Raz’ul and Yashee, you see Randy buckle over in pain-Goodrich: [Gasps]Kyle: And when he does you can the mark on the tattoo searing through his clothes. Energy from the mark is strongly emanating, lifting Randy’s hair slightly and it begins to overflow and starts to take form as Randy’s mage hand, making a finger gun. A ball of black and purple energy begins to form at the tip of the fingertip and from under Randy’s shirt you see that familiar creep of Eddie’s essence float around to Randy’s back and wrap around the thumb. You all hear Eddie screaming-Kyle (as Eddie): I’m telling you, kill this thing!Kyle: Eddie pulls the thumb back and releases it, causing the ball to fire off in a bolt of energy towards Squid. Just-Ali (as Yashee): Hit the deck![All laugh]Kyle: Everybody, get down!Goodrich: I also take my finger out of Randy’s back too just for-Kyle: Yeah, this is happening after that for sure.[All chuckle]Goodrich: I know, I'm just kidding.Ali: He had his finger in there this whole time like-Goodrich: I’m like, plugging a hole like- [panicked grunting]Kyle: So just before it reaches Squid one of the Gils jumps in front of Squid and is struck with the bolt and falls to the ground motionless. The energy that is pouring out of Randy begins to recede back into the mark and along with Eddie who returns to his navel base.[Players laugh]Goodrich: [Laughing] Forget you, man![All laugh]Kyle: Randy, you come to not knowing what just happened. You feel tired like you just run a bunch of obstacle courses, other than that you feel like you’re back to normal. And you hear Squid laugh surprisidly and is like-Kyle (as Squid): [Laughing] Whoa, that’s very different.Goodrich: I reach out and I pat you on the back-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You okay, buddy!? That was crazy, man!Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah I- [panting] woo..Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Pant like a puppy, pant like a puppy.[Goodrich and Spurrier panting]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Unless you wanna throw up, see if you can get that stone out, might be a good time.Spurrier (as Randy): That hasn’t worked before, it’s not gonna do it.Kyle (as Squid): I told him you weren’t ready yet, he needs to relax.Kyle: A moment later the Gil that was hit by the energy stands up sluggishly, disheveled and with a slacked jaw. It groans and then looks at Randy; groans again and then uses the lid they use to swim shuts over one eye and then the other and then it groans one more time and just stares at you blankly.Spurrier: Oh, well I'm just lying on the ground right now just trying to catch my breath.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He didn’t mean to do it! That was Eddie! I know, it's a lot to wrap your mind around but that’s uh- he hasn’t been feeling so great ever since getting down here.Kyle (as Squid): Well yes, I heard Randy’s- err- Eddie's-Goodrich: I’m talking to the fish that he just-Kyle: Oh, okay-Goodrich: Got fragged.Kyle: Oh, you’re talking to the dead fish?Spurrier: I was gonna say- it's dead.Goodrich: It’s dead!? Oh! I'm still talking to it like-Kyle: You’re still talking to it?Goodrich: Um, d-whoops!Kyle: It kind of like, shifts and looks at you and goes- [groans] and then looks back at Randy.Goodrich: Oh, so it’s a zombie fish now?Kyle: [Groans][Players laugh]Kyle: It walks over and it helps Randy up off the ground and like dusts off his shoulders and goes- [groans][All plays “oh!” surprised]Spurrier: The zombie fish? Well, thanks!Goodrich: Do you control the zombie fish?Spurrier: I’m about to find out!Ali: Tell it to do something or, you know.Spurrier: Let’s see here.Spurrier (as Randy): Zombie fish, go over and start petting the weird alien boy.Kyle: It tries to walk over and like, starts trying to pet the hand of the alien.Goodrich: [Softly] awesome.Kyle: And then Squid looks down and shakes his hand-Kyle (as Squid): Get- get off.Goodrich: Do another one, do another one!Spurrier: Oh, uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Zombie fish boy, uhh, mount the alien like a horse and ride it around![Players laugh]Kyle: It starts to try to climb on top of the alien and squid just pushes it off and like, throws it to the side.Kyle (as Squid): Are you trying to steal my servants?Goodrich: Aw, yeah!Spurrier (as Randy): Just- just admiring you.Kyle (as Squid): You were trying to steal my- no this is not how this happens. We can't have that, that’s our thing! I thought we were going to talk but I guess that won’t be happening.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, no, no! Wait, wait!Kyle (as Squid): Unless-Goodrich: Do my wisdom saving throw-Kyle (as Squid): Unless you kill the rest of them- oh, we are past- we are past pleasantries. Unless you kill the rest of them I don’t think we’ll be talking any further and I highly doubt your ability to break my domain over them. I don’t think it’s in the cards.Kyle: Squid lifts off the ground, levitating backwards into the shadow and out of sight and you hear him in your head say-Kyle (as Squid): Go fish.Goodrich: [Laughs] Oh, jeez!Kyle: The other Gils, they lower their spears and they look like they’re about to attack you. What are you going to do?Goodrich: Yup.Spurrier: Is there only one way out of here? Is it the way we came in or?Kyle: There’s the way you came in and the way that Squid went.Ali: Is this a running away situation that you were talking about?[All chuckle]Goodrich: Years of foreshadowing-Kyle: While you’re stewing over what your option is going to be and you are facing these other Gils that are pointing spears at you, the Gil you know steps forward and goes-Kyle (as Gil): Gil, you don’t want to do this. That’s a false prophet, false god.Kyle: And one of them chimes back-Kyle (as Gil #2): [Same voice] You know Gil-[Players laugh]Kyle (as Gil #2): I don’t believe you. The goddess behind the door has led us to the promise land. You can ask Gil-[Players chuckle]Kyle: And another Gil jumps in-Kyle (as Gil #3): [Same voice] Uh, Gil’s right, Gil.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Gil #3): If you had just joined us everything would be fine.Kyle: And Gil, that you know-Goodrich: Right.Kyle: Shakes their hand and looks at you three and is just like-Kyle (as Gil): Can we do anything to save them?Goodrich: Right so, pass without a trace is still cast so we’ve got that.Spurrier: True.Goodrich: Yes.Spurrier: They are all looking right at us.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Right, we could try to hide.Spurrier: That’s true.Goodrich: I mean, and then we would have to succeed on hiding right?Kyle: Yeah.Ali: And think about what we’re gonna do I mean, we’ve also gotta get out of here somehow.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Is the zombie fish still around?Kyle: Yeah, the zombie fish is still around.Spurrier: Is it still zombified?Kyle: Yeah, it’s near them and the other Gils are kind of looking at it like-Goodrich: Make him bite another Gil.Goodrich I say, to you, as Raz’ul-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Make him bite another Gil, dude.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, okay! Zombie Gil! [Silence] Zombie Gil?Kyle (as Zombie Gil) [Sudden groan]Spurrier (as Randy): There we are, good. Um, go and bite another Gil and see if that does anything cool.Kyle: It goes and tries to bite one of the other Gils that Gil was talking to. And it goes over and kind of slowly tries to bite onto its shoulder and one of the Gils is just like- “no”-[Players laugh]Kyle: And holds it off with a hand.Ali: Just bats him away.Spurrier: I turn to you guys-Spurrier (as Randy): Well, um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That might take awhile but- hey, how’d you do that other thing that almost made you puke?Spurrier (as Randy): That- I think when she was focusing on Eddie in his mind- hang on a second.Spurrier: And I think to myself.Spurrier (as Randy): Could you do that again?Kyle (as Eddie): [Exhausted] Not anytime soon.Spurrier (as Randy): Got it, okay.Kyle (as Eddie): We’ll get there.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright, sorry guys. Little Eddie’s all pooped.Kyle (as Eddie): But that- that one, that one, will be yours for a little while.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, Okay! Um, you guys got any thoughts?Ali: So these Gils, are they actively like coming towards us to attack or are they just kind of hanging out?Kyle: It looks like they’re more so blocking your path.Ali: And you said they have like, spears?Kyle: Yeah, they have spears pointed at you.Goodrich: They’re like the brave three hundred, sounds like, they’re failings.Kyle: Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): They don’t seem like really mad or anything or-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe we could talk to them.Ali (as Yashee): Or ready to pounce. I don’t know if we should just start attacking them if they’re not really trying to do anything to us.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): True.Kyle (as Gil): Yeah I mean, they are you know, my Gils.[Players chuckle]Spurrier: Am I able to round a corner from the way that we came? Is there like a- okay, is it just like a long passageway or-Kyle: No, it’s a long, straight passageway.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: Pretty much where we’re standing is, we’re at the entrance to this door and right inside the door are all the fish folk and then, where we can’t see, is Squid Vicious.Kyle: Yeah, well, that’s the direction Squid Vicious went.Goodrich: He’s in front of us.Kyle: You can’t see him.Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: I think Yashee, before I want to attack or anything, just wanna see if these people are actually going to try to start something. So, I'm gonna walk, I'm gonna take my maul out just to have it in front of me but in like a non-threatening way?Kyle: Yeah no, approaching somebody with a weapon is never non-threatening.[Players chuckle]Ali: Well I’ll hold it one hand so it makes it look more like a staff.Goodrich: Swing it over your shoulder.Spurrier: The royal Yashee scepter.Ali: I’ll put it on my back and the-[Overlapping conversation and laughter]Ali: No, I'll probably just put it in one hand you know, kind of waltz up to them just to see how they react.Kyle: Okay so you walk up, do you say anything as you’re walking up?Ali: Yeah um, I’ll say-Ali (as Yashee): Hey Gils, is there any way we can just go past you? We just wanna talk to your boss.Kyle: And the one at the front of this, they’re doing the flying V style Mighty Duck thing to block this passageway.Ali: Oh, okay.Kyle: And the front one like, juts it’s spear towards you threateningly like-Kyle (as Gil #2): No, no outsiders. Get back. Get back!Ali: Okay.Kyle (as Gil #2): You’re unworthy, you’re not allowed to pass. That includes you Gil.Goodrich: Is it turning to the side talking to his friend or is he talking to our Gil?Kyle: He’s talking to your Gil.Goodrich: Okay so you gotta- [chuckles]Kyle: He points- yeah, I did say he pointed his spear, this is an audio medium.[All laugh]Kyle: He shifts his spear over and points it towards Gil.Kyle (as Gil #2): You too, Gil. You're not allowed.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You are Gil though.Kyle (as Gil #2): Yeah.Goodrich: You did this to yourself, Kyle.Kyle: [In Gil’s voice] Yeah, I know I did.[Players laugh]Ali: Alright well, I'm gonna take my maul and kinda bring it in front of me with both hands then and maybe step a little bit closer just ready to smack it’s spear out of the way-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Y- Yashee, hey! Remember, you’re not as big as you were.Kyle: Okay, you step forward and you’re preparing for this so- [rolls dice] alright, it juts it’s spear forward and you are ready and your maul just slaps the spear right out of the way, and all of these Gils get really tense and they start to like, fan out a little bit and take more of a readied stance to like, attack.Goodrich: So their focus is on Yashee?Spurrier: Yeah, that’s what I was about to ask.Kyle: Yeah, they’re all focused at Yashee.[Multiple dice rolling]Ali: Alright so I'll start to back up going-Ali (as Yashee): Hey, hey! You know, this is exactly what I wanted to check for okay? You’re serious, I get it.Spurrier: And while Yashee’s doing that-Goodrich: Me too-Spurrier: I just rolled an eighteen plus nine plus ten for stealth.Goodrich: I just rolled a seventeen plus ten. [chuckles]Kyle: Okay. [Rolls dice] Alright so they’re focusing on Yashee and they’re backing up and they’re huddled in the door.Ali: They’re not trying? They’re just-Kyle: No, they-Ali: Closing in?Kyle: No, you backed up and they just went back to their stance like, in front of the door.Spurrier: Kyle, what sized creatures are these? These fall as a medium sized creature?Kyle: Medium creature.Spurrier: Okay, cool. Because I'm a halfling I am nimble so I am easily able to move through creatures that are larger than I am.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: So I'm gonna start weaving my way through all stealthy. Going under their legs and stuff.Kyle: Mkay, you weave through and you hear Squid Vicious in all of your minds and they say-Kyle (as Squid): The littlest one is getting past you, you’re failing me.Kyle: And two of them turn around- [Rolls dice] They look a little bit and they kind of just keep looking but doesn’t look like they see you.[Players laugh]Spurrier: A thirty-seven, oh yeah! Alright, I'm gonna keep dancing my way through. Shuffling, grooving, moving.Goodrich: Cool, I wanna try to sneak past them too since I'm all stealthed now.Kyle: Did you?Goodrich: I did, I rolled a seventeen plus ten plus one for jack of all trades so, twenty-eight.Kyle: Alright, go for it.Goodrich: So, I'm gonna kind of go to the outside where- maybe where there’s a little opening? They were focusing on Yashee so I imagine the ones on the end were kind of inching to get closer and make sure so I'm gonna sneak past right against a wall and be like, oop, oop, oop, gotta put my back up against it like- [straining groan]Kyle: It’s a difficult squeeze but you manage through it. And now Yashee and the Miners are on the other side and you two are behind them.Spurrier: Alright-Kyle: There are two that are looking backwards kind of trying to get a glimpse of what’s going on.Ali: What about the rest of them? Are they looking around their feet to try to find these boys?Kyle: No, they’re keeping an eye on you and the miners.Ali: Okay.Spurrier: So, while that’s happening, Randy take’s his organ and since it’s covered in knobs and buttons it’s got a volume knob on it of course. He turns it down really really softly-Kyle: Alright-Spurrier: And whispers to himself-Spurrier (as Randy): [To the tune of Transformers theme] Transformers, Randy’s now a fish.[All laugh]Spurrier: And I disguise myself as a Gil boy!Kyle: Okay, so for casting this spell- lets get another stealth check to see how stealthy you actually cast it.Spurrier: There’s- are those two still looking at me?Kyle: Yeah-Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: There’s two still looking at you.Spurrier: That seems fair. [Rolls dice] That is a fourteen plus nine plus ten, thirty-three!Kyle: [Rolls dice] You’re good!Spurrier: Hurray!Goodrich: I wanna play something too, Kyle!Kyle: Okay, what are you gonna play?Goodrich: Okay so, I'm gonna cast unseen servant and um, it’s a bard spell so just like-Kyle: Okay-Goodrich: Just like on the organ I think Usumptin has some sort of rune or something that I press that turns down the volume a little bit and I say- [shushing] and I'm gonna cast it uhh, let me put my pick down. [Soft clink] I’m real quiet and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Singing] I ain’t got no body but somebody works for me. [Soft scatting][All chuckle]Goodrich: So this spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks on my command until the spell ends. AC of ten, one hit point strength of two and this thing is invisible to everyone else but am I allowed to see him, Kyle? Maybe?Kyle: Yeah you see the magical essence that outlines this featureless thing.Goodrich: Can I- can it be like Marty Feldman from Young Frankenstein but instead of a black robe he’s wearing like a James Brown super glittery-Kyle: And only you can see it, yeah.Goodrich: Only I can see it and I’m like, “ayy!”Kyle: So, since you’re doing a spell let’s have you roll another stealth check like Randy.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Seven plus ten, seventeen! Oh, eighteen plus jack of all trades.Kyle: [Rolling dice] Oh, one actually catches a glimpse of you.Goodrich: Aw.Kyle: And its like-Kyle (as Gil #4): I’ve got it boss!Kyle: And you hear Squid go-Kyle (as Squid): It’s about time.Goodrich: Right. [Sighs] Horse apples, okay can I still have my unseen servant do what I was going to have them do?Kyle: Yeah, yeah you can totally direct your person while they are in the midst of seeing you.Goodrich: Okay cool. Well, I'm gonna have uhh..oh boy. I didn’t name this thing. Um, Skerrple D- Dee Doo-[Ali laughs loudly]Spurrier: Skerple Dee Doo, the invisible servant.Goodrich: Yeah, Skerrple Dee Doo-Ali: [Laughing] Ol’ Skerple.Goodrich: Skerrple. Uh, I think that’s an off-brand sharpie.Kyle: Probably.Spurrier: Oh like-Goodrich: [Laughing] Yeah that’s where I got it.Kyle: They're the ones that say “toxic” on the side.[All laugh]Goodrich: Well my Skerrple will be spelled with two R’s, so Sker-rple! Um, so Skerrple will come into existence on an unoccupied space on the front and on the side of all these fish people? And then I want Skerrple to throw a rock at one of them on the side and hit him in the head.Kyle: Okay, the unseen servant picks up and rock, throws it at a fish person, it hits them in the head and they turn to look left. It's- I'll say it’s the most left-ward person from your perspective. And they look left, don’t see anything and turn back to the others-Goodrich: I have him throw another one, at another fish.Kyle: At another fish? Alright, same result. What are you- I have to know what you’re trying to do-Goodrich: I’m trying to distract them all of them so that they all look over and [mumbling] maybe Yashee and them can sneak around behind where we are?Kyle: Well you’re only throwing one rock at a time.Goodrich: But they could throw a bunch, they could do anything an actual servant can do. So can I have him throw a fistful of rocks?Kyle: [Elegant accent] Servant, go outside and throw my rocks for me![All laugh]Kyle: [Elegant accent] I have a long day of sitting around.Goodrich: That’s what it says!Kyle: [Laughs] No, it’s fine!Goodrich: Fistful of rocks at all the fish fellers on the left-hand side.Kyle: Okay so, it throws a bunch of rocks and the head one goes-Kyle (as Gil #2): Wh- what's going on? Two of you, stab in that area? I don’t know what-Goodrich: Yeah, keep throwing them, keep throwing them like Buddy the elf throwing snow balls.[Players laughing]Goodrich: They’re erupting from the walls now it looks like.Kyle: Two go over and just like, stab randomly- well, what I'm gonna do is roll attacks at disadvantage since it’s invisible.Goodrich: It does have an AC of ten.Kyle: Alright so, the first one misses. [Rolls dice] the second one seems to catch it.Goodrich: D’oh!Kyle: And you see your magical glitter-glam cape boy disappear.Goodrich: Aw, bye Skerrple.Kyle: Okay so Yashee, what are you doing in this midst? What you see right now is, you’ve noticed that two of the, let’s say there’s ten total, two of the ten fish people- Gils, have turned around and are looking in the direction that you imagine Randy and Raz’ul went.Ali: Can I see them?Kyle: Yeah, we’ll say since you’re magical allies you’re able to see them and notice them and everything like that. But-Goodrich: At we’re want- at least Randy is want to do that so you’re probably like, “oh he’s probably hiding- there he is!” sneaky Randy.Kyle: So you see this happen to him, they’re facing backwards. Two of them on the left, on your right-hand side start to stab at- look like mid-air but then all the sudden you see like this pile of rocks drop and you notice like a few rocks being thrown in their direction, that’s what drew them over. But yeah, what are you doing in this-Ail: And the rest are still looking at me-Kyle: Yeah, they’re still holding down the “you’re not gonna get past us” gig.Ali: Am I back by the miners at this point?Kyle: Yeah, you’re standing near the miners.Kyle: Erin’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Where did the other two go? I mean, we gotta-Ali: Where’s the stream headed?Kyle: It’s coming from the newly opened door and you can see that the stream picked up. Last episode when I was talking about the door opening the stream actually picked up in current, like the door was limiting how much water could flow but now you can see water flowing right out of it.Goodrich: So really, all we have to do is stay here for the rest of our lives with the door open and the city will be saved.Spurrier: Done!Ali: We did it!Goodrich: We did it! [Spurrier humming the theme] Thanks everyone!Kyle: Bye!Goodrich: It was fun![All laugh]Goodrich: Looks like we’re staying here now.Kyle: Wrong.Ali: Alright, then I'm just going to talk to them a bit and let them know what’s going on.Kyle: Okay, alright, I see what you-Ali (as Yashee): You know, if you look closely between all their legs you can see those boys back there.Kyle (as Erin): How’d they even fit past there?Ali (as Yashee): They’re sneaky.Kyle (as Erin): Alright I mean, how are we- we ain’t that sneaky.Ali (as Yashee): I feel like they’re probably devising a plan back there. I almost wanna see what happens first.Kyle (as Erin): I mean, I hope so.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe we’ll get our moment to sneak past them too if we can get through but at the same time-Kyle (as Erin): Doesn’t seem fish guy doesn’t want to outright kill them.Ali (as Yashee): I don’t want to kill them either.Ali: Is the, our Gil with us?Kyle: Yeah, Gils standing next to you.Ali (as Yashee): Gil, what do you think? You know these guys.Kyle (as Gil): Yeah but they’re under some hullabaloo from that squid thing and I don’t- I don’t know.Ali (as Yashee): Well maybe I could try to de-charm one of them to see if we could at least turn him that way.Kyle (as Gil): Yeah? I mean, I don’t know what happened with your smallest buddy there but um, you can try not to do that. I mean I don’t like that Gil anyway.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: He’s a real jerk.Kyle (as Gil): Granted I'm losing out on a little bit of shclams but that’s our problem.Ali: Well, then I guess I'm gonna go ahead and cast charm person. I'm gonna aim it at the first little fish boy there in the V.Kyle: Okay.Ali: And hopefully see if my spell is strong enough to turn him.Kyle: Okay.Ali: So, I'm really gonna focus in on that fish. We’re like, locking eyes really intently.Kyle; It’s really trying to lock eyes with you but it’s weird cause it’s eyes-Kyle & Goodrich: Are on the side of it’s head![Goodrich laughing loudly]Kyle: So it looks like ridiculously cross eyed but you can tell it’s staring you down back.Ali: Okay, and then I take out my hammer mallets while I kind of start shifting side to side to give it a little bit of eye contact here and there.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Just so he understands that-Goodrich: He’s being hypnotized.Ali: Anyway, I take out my mallets while I'm staring and shifting and I start uh, hmm.. I guess I'll start tapping them together.Kyle: Okay.Ali: [Singing while a soft drum beat and bass plays] I put a spell on you, and now you’re charmed.Kyle: Okay, I have to make a wisdom saving throw.Ali: Yeah, and my spell save is thirteen.Kyle: Thirteen, right. Okay no, so fish guy kinda looks at you and then turns its head-body a little sideways and then turns to the others and is just like-Kyle (as Gil #2): Gils, maybe we underestimated these people, and this shorter one right in the middle in the middle of the other two seems to be alright. I dunno, what do you think?Goodrich: [softly] Nice.Kyle: Sounds like its made a success.Ali: Alright, I turn around to the miners and I’m like-Ali (as Yashee): It worked! Did you see that!?[Players chuckle]Kyle: And Trish kind of goes-Kyle (as Trish): Yeah that’s pretty crazy right there, too bad you can’t do it for all of them.Ali (as Yashee): I can’t, I don’t think I can muster that much. I'm so little right now.Kyle (as Trish): Well, I don’t know what to tell you but that’s just one out of the ten.Ali (as Yashee): [disappointed] Yeah.Goodrich: That’s better than nothing though.Ali (as Yashee): I think I'm gonna need a little bit of help.Ali: So, she takes out her mallets and she kind of starts playing a little bit. She's gonna call out to the guys through song that we need to massive, do a mass charming.Kyle: Mkay, so when you’re thinking of doing this mass charm that’s when you notice the runes on your mallets begin to flicker and light up like they normally do when there’s bardic magic abouts.Ali: Alright, then I'm gonna go to town.Kyle: Alright, so it sounds like we’re about to do a song.Goodrich: Oh boy!Spurrier: Oh boy!Kyle: So, let’s roll some chord dice.Ali: Woo hoo![Electronic music]Goodrich: So what- [chuckles] So, Yashee is calling out to us but what-Kyle: Here’s the set up of the room. So, in the circular room where you originally tried to open the door you have Yashee, the three miners, the two Gils that are on your side and then at the door you have a V of I guess would be about eight-Goodrich: Ten, yeah-Kyle: Eight Gils now.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: And behind that line of Gils, you have about ten, fifteen feet back. I'm assuming how far you snuck back there but you’re probably about ten to fifteen feet, both of you behind there. Randy, as a Gil looking person and Raz’ul-Goodrich: I guess I look like I've been caught sneaking around tip-toeing like- [surprised gasp]Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So that’s the set up.Goodrich: You’re still a Gil?Spurrier: Oh yeah.Kyle: Still Gilin’Ali: I guess he’s just on a break or something.[All laugh]Kyle: [as Gil] Um, union five!Goodrich: For real. Okay so, that’s where we’re at so you’re gonna call out to us in song. Fantastic.Kyle: Yeah so, let’s roll some chord dice.Goodrich: Mkay.[Multiple dice rolling]Kyle: Major or minor?Goodrich: Oh right.Spurrier: [Hums]Ali: We are trying to get them to be like, friends with us and be like, “hey we’re here to help you!”Spurrier: Breaking this crazy like-Kyle: Sounds like you’re trying to make a minor adjustment to their mind.Goodrich: Oooh!Ali: You really want this minor, don’t you?[All laugh]Kyle: No, I'm just saying-Ali: [Joking] We get it, Kyle. He wants minor.Kyle: Like a Goku, I'm just Saiyan.[Players laugh loudly]Goodrich: Uh I mean, I could go either way.Spurrier: I could see minor, yeah. Both with all these puns and-Kyle: We don’t do C-minor.Goodrich: You gotta stop-Spurrier: I can A-minor this.[All laughing]Spurrier: Um yeah, between that and us trying to lift an evil curse that could constitute minor.Ali: Yeah.Kyle: If you guys ever can’t decide and just wanna flip a coin, ever?Goodrich: Yeah, let’s do that.Kyle: It could be fun, I mean if you really don’t have- if you just-Goodrich: Here I'm gonna roll-Kyle: If you’re just playing it by ear.Goodrich: Common roll d10, tell me high or low.Kyle: What? No. You don’t do that, I do that.Goodrich: High or low. High or low, Kyle?Kyle: I said flip a coin-[Dice rolls, giggling]Kyle: Low.[All laughing]Kyle: I don’t know what that means.[Overlapping conversation, all agreeing minor]Goodrich: Alright, chord dice time.[Multiple dice rolling]Kyle: What’d I get?Goodrich: Spurrier got a wild.Spurrier: Got a wild, try again. [Rolls dice]Kyle: You stole my wild-Goodrich: Again! Come on, man.Spurrier: Turning into Kyle over here.Kyle: That’s right.[Dice rolling, all exclaim it’s another one]Kyle: Yeah here, you can have the screen, dude. It's all you.[Dice rolling]Spurrier: Okay, C, cool.Goodrich: Well, we rolled C and A-minor but whatever.[Players chuckle]Spurrier: We can do what we want- Well, now we can make this E-minor and E if we want.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And let’s talk about modal mixture.Goodrich: Yeah for real. So, we have C, A-minor, E-minor and B-diminished is what we rolled. Drum roll please.Ali: Okay. [Coin hits the table] Oh, what’s that over there? That’s a heads- [Rolls dice] seventy-three which if I'm reading this correctly is Latin Fusion.[Boys pleasantly surprised]Goodrich: Good thing we have seventh chords.Ali: Yup. [Rolls dice] Okay uh, [chuckles] ninety-eight, ninety-eight is World 1.Goodrich: Nice.Kyle: Cool, alright.[Goodrich singing in the background]Ali: I’m very excited, Latin Fusion and World kit.Goodrich: Yes, perfect. Okay, good luck over there Ali!Ali: [Chuckles] Thanks, good luck to you!Goodrich: Yeah, we’re just gonna hear this crazy Latin Fusion beat and be like “ooh!”Spurrier: Yes!Kyle: Feeling it.

Bye![Music transitions]Ali: So, I begin going to town.[Quick latin beat begins playing]Ali (singing) When you look at me you might just see me beating on my drum  But this groove won’t do the trick when I am only one  So, lend a hand and join the song, we’ll help your minds be free  Strum up the charm and turn the keys, unlock reality   All (singing): All you fishy folk are free  From the voice that talks to you  When you hear that funky melody  Remember what you knew   Spurrier (singing): [Imitating Gil] When you look at me you might just see a fish that’s just like you  I’ve got fins and scales and fish details; I promise that it’s true  This week has been a little weird and what’s that all about?  These folks seem cool; I’m not a fool, they want to help us out   All (singing): All you fishy folk are free  From the voice that talks to you  When you hear that funky melody  Remember what you knew   All (singing): All you fishy folk are free  And every one of you will see  That all you fishy folk can be  Swimming swimming in the sea[Music ends]Kyle: Okay Yashee you begin drumming out your beats and your rune begins lighting up. Magic begins emitting from them and starting to flow out and coalesce and form. Randy, Raz’ul you pick up exactly what’s going down so you bring out your instruments and join along and you notice Yashee, as she starts singing, the runes that you normally see on her instrument they appear on her throat.[Players excited gasping and awe]Kyle: And you look at each other kind of oddly, just a little confused and you notice the same thing’s going on for you two.Goodrich: [Gasps]Spurrier: Even on my sweet fish throat?Kyle: Yes, even on your sweet fish throat. So, you all begin to play, your magic coalesces into being and it’s just vapors and whispers that kind of just weave in and out of the different Gils and fish people and everything. And they start looking around, of course the zombie Gil is not affected at all[Players laugh]Kyle: It's still blinking one eye as this is happening. Yashee, the Gil you had charmed is encouraging the others like, “yeah.” You know, shaking on them and everything. Randy, when you step out as a Gil the others kind of look at you just like, whoa where’d this guy come from? And they’re all kind of nodding and buying in and they all like, rub their forehead and look at each other just like.Kyle (as Gils): W-what were we doing?Kyle: And by the time you end the song their arms are down and they’re just looking at each other like, [in Gil voice] Whats- what's going on?Goodrich: [Singing quietly] What’s the buzz, tell me what’s happening.Kyle: And Gil, the Gil you originally met, goes forward-Kyle (as Gil): Is everyone- is everyone, everyone? Gil? Are you okay? Gil? Are you okay?Goodrich: [Chuckles, imitates Gil] Yeah, I'm fine.Kyle (as Gil): Gil back there, are you alright?Kyle: And they all respond positively and they seem to not be as agitated as they were before.Ali: Yes!Goodrich: Nice!Spurrier: While this is happening real quick, I pop behind Raz’ul- [rolls dice] sixteen plus nine plus ten. So, I'm hidden behind him then I take off my disguise and pop out like, “aw man, what did I miss!?”[All chuckle]Spurrier (as Randy): What’s going on here, you guys?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, we played a little tune and actually, this cool fish guy actually played a line in the middle bit that was a little scaler.[Overlapping conversation]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We just seemed to really click so yeah.Randy (as Randy): Phew.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Everyone seems to be doing better. Everybody, fins up if you’re doing okay. Err- do they have fins?Kyle (as Gil #2): We have hands.Goodrich: Hands up-Kyle: I guess there’s like fins on their elbow? I’m modifying it a little bit, there’s fins on their elbow and they lift their elbow up instead of their hands.[Players chuckle]Ali: Well alright.Goodrich: Well cool-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, you fellers had quite a spell put on you, I think we might have gotten rid of it. So, we’re on the way to see the-Ali (as Yashee): Goddess behind the door?Goodrich: Yeah- [singing] We’re off to see the goddess, the goddess behind the door.Kyle: Gil- Gil, the Gil you know, comes over and says-Kyle (as Gil): Don’t- don’t, don’t feed them that crap again!Ali (as Yashee): Some idiot behind the door?[Players laugh]Kyle: And they’re all kind of talking to Gil in the original language you heard Gil talking in under-common so you can’t really understand what they’re saying but they seem really distressed, disturbed, and frightened now that they’ve kind of come to and realized what’s happening. The Gil that you know is the only one you’re able to talk to at this point.Goodrich: Right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Gil?Kyle (as Gil): Yeah?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you think you and your friends wanna join us going after-Spurrier (as Randy): Can help save all your people?Kyle (as Gil): Uh well, they are telling me some very disturbing things about what happened in there and I don’t blame them if they don’t wanna go back in there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s fine.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Looks like it’s-Ali (as Yashee): It’s just us.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): And the miners!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And your fish zombie boy.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh yeah!Kyle (as Gil): Yeah that one I don’t-I don’t even know what’s going on-Spurrier (as Randy): Are you okay if he tags along?Goodrich: Maybe the one you charmed?Ali: My charm doesn’t last forever though.Goodrich: ooh, okay.Ali: I don’t want to pull him into something and him come out of it being like, “why did you do this to me!?”Goodrich: Okay, okay.[Overlapping conversation]Goodrich: Okay well uh-Kyle (as Gil): I mean if there’s more of us up there you can save them. That's cool but these are you know, they’re pretty good.Goodrich: Alright, we can head back in-Spurrier: The door.Goodrich: We can head back in. If we’re not back in an hour, call the president.Ali (as Yashee): Anything in particular that they said we should be watching out for?Kyle (as Gil): Well, they just talked about experiments? Is what the word they used. So um, I don’t know what that means.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah well, keep a look out I suppose.Goodrich: So, should we motion to the miners like, think we’re gonna head in? These uh-Kyle: Erin walks over and she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah good, it’s about time. Um, I reckon we should probably follow this stream. Seems to be the source of water, we’re trying to fix water so  -Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle (as Erin): I think that’s the direction we’re gonna be headed but I dunno what we’re gonna find in there so yeah, I guess move on if ya’ll are ready.Goodrich: And can we all roll stealth rolls while we’re- [chuckles] walking in darkness?Kyle: Sure if you want to.Goodrich: Not making that mistake again.[Multiple dice rolling]Ali: I got a three plus one!Kyle: Sweet.Ali: So, you know.Kyle: Plus the ten-Spurrier: Yeah, plus ten.Ali: Oh! That’s a fourteen.Kyle: Sweet.Spurrier: Thirteen plus nine, plus ten.Kyle: Right.Goodrich: Nineteen plus one plus ten!Kyle: Right, okay, cool, cool, cool.Goodrich: Leave us alone, Kyle![Players chuckle]Kyle: [Rolls dice] The miners are following suit and trying to move stealthily along behind you. You all hear in your head, Squid again say-Kyle (as Squid): Oh, well-Goodrich: Do we wanna turn left up here?Kyle (as Squid): Isn’t that- isn't that something? Huh, well perhaps [chuckles] perhaps we can have a chat. Please, come in and while you’re in here you can meet my pet Ivan.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier: Hm.Goodrich: Hoo!Kyle: And I guess you’ll have to wait until next time-[Theme song plays]Goodrich: But what’s Ivan!?Kyle: You’ll have to wait until next time!-----Transcripts by: Gabi Cardone@peachdoodles – Twitter"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-18-layers-and-lairs,Ep. 18 – Layers and Lairs,"Ep. 18 – Layers and Lairs[Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey everyone welcome back to BomBARDed, let’s do an recap of last episode real quick. It started with our bards having and interesting conversation with Squid about- [exhausted sigh] a lot of things but-[Players chuckle]Kyle: First he spoke about how the surface should be a jungle and not desert.Goodrich: Mhm.Kyle: And the effects of the summoning of the blue moon must have had on the planet and then boasted a little bit about the power of mind over magic-Goodrich: The gathering.Kyle: [Softly] What?Goodrich: Magic the Gathering.Kyle: Oh![Players laugh]Kyle: Gotcha, but anyway, mind over magic, yes.[Goodrich laughs]Kyle: But then we had an intrusion of minds where Yashee had a display of iron will.Ali: Not getting past this steel trap.Goodrich: Nope.Ali: Nah.Goodrich: Not that one.Kyle: Not at all.Goodrich: Not today!Kyle: But as usual, poor Randy, poor Randy-Spurrier: Oh Randy.Kyle: This was not the case-Spurrier: No..Kyle: Squid actually probed deeper into Randy’s mind and eventually into Eddie’s mind, which, Eddie kind of freaked about this and did not enjoy it very much so, which caused Eddie to take over and make a finger gun of death that ended up being blocked by a Gil jumping in the way of Squid being the target. But you know this created a little bit of a zombie Gil for you so you know, you’ve got a bit of a partner to go around with you-Spurrier: A friend for Randy.Goodrich: Aw. Finally, a real friend for you-Spurrier: A real friend for Ran-dy!Kyle: I guess you two aren’t real friends?[Players all make a noise of uncertainty]Goodrich: [Softly] Oh no.Kyle: Squid wasn’t too ha- [Kyle and players burst into laughter]Goodrich: Quit it, Kyle!Kyle: Squid wasn’t too happy about this and then decided that the pleasantries were over and retreated back into their lair. So, at that point they said you’d have to kill the Gils if you want to get in and that you probably wouldn't be able to break any hold that Squid had over them. But after beating around the bush, Yashee decided to give it a try by casting charm person and upon it succeeding realized that you should be able to write a song and perhaps all the Gils would come out of being mind controlled. Luckily, you were successful![Players cheer]Kyle: Worked out this time.Goodrich: Sorry, I know it probably felt a little bit like herding cats but uh-Kyle: You know-Goodrich: You’re face-[Players burst into laughter]Kyle: If you don’t want to eat what I'm serving that’s fine. It’s okay, Alto Brown can close the kitchen down.Goodrich: For real.[Laughter continues]Kyle: After you broke Squid’s hold over them, they were talking to the Gil you know about the horrific events that have gone on inside and they were pretty much of the mind set of, “I’m not gonna go back in there.”Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: “I’m good.” and they said, “well you can take that zombie Gil with you, it’s already a zombie so, why not?”Spurrier: Yeah!Goodrich: Of course.Kyle: And of course the miners were very much in the mindset of wanting to go in, following the water and everything, and Squid to their surprise “Ah! I guess come on in just watch out for my pet, Ivan.”Goodrich: Ho!Kyle: So, that’s where we’re gonna pick up.Goodrich: Let’s do it.Kyle: So, you’re walking-Goodrich: Hold on real quick, so, Erin and the miners can hear Squid in their heads too right?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay, I'm gonna turn to all of you and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, do you think this guy really knows what we’re thinking? I don’t know- maybe he’s got some sort of P.A. System into our noodle but-Kyle (as Squid): Yes I know what you’re thinking.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh really? Well, what number am I thinking of?[Silent]Kyle: Tell me what number you’re thinking of.Goodrich: [Laughs loudly] You can’t do that, Kyle!Kyle: Sure you can! It’s an ability of this creature.Goodrich: [Defeated] Never mind.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It was twenty-two.Kyle (as Squid): I know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aw.[All chuckle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aw crap, he’s got us guys, nevermind.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh yeah, yeah.Kyle: So, you finally enter and you’re walking through this hallway and you notice the walls are designed with a spiral texture to it. Kind of a purplish, black rock but you notice in the pits of the spirals there’s like this weird film, like a greyish black film that just lines the walls.Goodrich: Gross.Spurrier: YeahGoodrich: I say that to you guys, check this out. Nasty. He probably should have cleaned up if he knew he was having visitors.Ali: Well I go ahead and pull out my Ziplock of fingers.Goodrich: Oh jeez-Kyle: Oh- yeah, okay.Ali: I have two, so I’m gonna pull one out and toss it at that stuff, just to see what happens.Kyle: Okay-Ali (as Yashee): Hey, hey watch out! I'm gonna throw this finger!Kyle: Which finger are you throwing?Ali: Um, well I'll keep the middle finger.Goodrich: Right, naturally.Ali: Keep that one in there.Goodrich: Right-Ali: Let’s say the index finger.Goodrich: Save it for when we finally freakin’ meet Squid dude, say “here’s what we think.”Ali: Just throw the Ziplock at him-[Players laugh and agree]Ali: Figure it out!Kyle: Okay so, you take this finger and you throw it at the wall and it hits the wall and you see the film that’s lining the crevasses and these nooks and crannies just grasp out and grab it, suck it in and you see it like, dissolve-[Players groan in disgust]Kyle: Into this gray-black material.Spurrier: [Disgusted] Okay..Goodrich: So much for that-Ali: We’re not getting that back.[Players chuckle]Kyle: And it’s at this time you see the film actually leave all the crevasses and nooks and crannies and coalesces into this grayish, black amoeba-like form. Pieces of it are falling from the ceiling, dripping down, adding to its mass every once in a while, which makes it much larger and it begins to fill your path.Ali: Oops![Players laugh]Kyle: You hear Squid say-Kyle (as Squid): This is my pet, Ivan.Spurrier: Oh.Kyle (as Spurrier): Ivan Ooze, I guess.[All laugh]Goodrich: [Through laughter] Shut up! You suck, Kyle! Here I was about to make a Conker’s Bad Fur Day joke. [Singing] I am the great and mighty ooze!Kyle: That would have been good too! That works-Goodrich: You toss in Power Rangers!Kyle: So [chuckles] let’s roll initiative![Players sigh in unison]Spurrier: Oh boy.[Multiple dice rolling]Ali: I’ve got an eleven.Goodrich: I got an eleven too!Spurrier: I got an eleven cause it’s eight plus three!Goodrich: Whoa!Kyle: Who has the highest dexterity?Spurrier: Uh, me.Goodrich: Do we get like, bonus points for all rolling the same number?Kyle: No!Spurrier: Bonus round!Kyle: Who’s got the second highest dexterity?Ali: I got a twelve.Goodrich: Mine’s ten.Kyle: Alright, so that gives me my order.Ali: Is this another walk in through the door at the exact same time and we all three get stuck?Goodrich: Yeah-Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Like, come on guys. Like, an oversized door but Yashee’s so small.Kyle: You know what? Yeah! You all move around cause you’re all like, “No you go, no you go!” you’re just all too polite to each other and you waste a round so I'm gonna get an action.Ali: No, wait-Kyle: I’m joking, I'm not that mean! I’m just gonna do this real quick. The miners step back and you hear Erin say-Kyle (as Erin): Whoa-ho! What- what the hell’s that thing!? I ain’t about to tackle with that!Spurrier: Okay um-Kyle (as Erin): You three go on right ahead!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But Boom Queen, you got something that might be kind of helpful in those boom sacks, right?Ali: [Giggling] Some boom sacks?Kyle: [Chuckling] Boom sacks.Goodrich: Boom sacks.Spurrier: Boom-Kyle: Sacks boom.Goodrich: What does she call ‘em?Ali: I was gonna say boom sticks, you got some boom sticks and some-Ali & Goodrich: Boom sacks-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Yeah, I got some boom sticks, let me see- you know, I don’t understand the texture of this area and I don’t want to create like, a huge cave in if-Spurrier (as Randy): And if that stuff splatters and hits us-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Taking down a door that’s one thing-[All agreeing]Kyle (as Boom Queen): I can control a blast that way but I don’t know how this area is gonna react.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, alright, settle down.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Hesitant.Goodrich: Well, okay, go team!Kyle: Randy! You are first up in initiative so what do?Spurrier: Uh okay so, I think to myself-Spurrier (as Randy): Eddie? Eddie?!Kyle: What a wonderful world.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Eddie): Hey man, what’s going on?Spurrier (as Randy): You feelin’ a little more charged up again? After all that?Kyle (as Eddie): Aw man it’s been like five minutes.Spurrier (as Randy) Oh..so, you’re not up for doing anything I’m guessing then?Kyle (as Eddie): I mean, nothing you can’t already do through me. You know what I mean?Spurrier (as Randy) Does that mean I can cast my spells?Kyle (as Eddie): Yeah-Spurrier (as Randy) Alright-Kyle (as Eddie): You can cast your spells-Spurrier (as Randy) Okay, cool. That’s what I was trying to get at, okay.Kyle (as Eddie): I mean, our spells I guess-Spurrier (as Randy) Our spells, yes. Sharing is caring.Kyle (as Eddie): Give me some credit.Spurrier: So, I’m gonna do a chromatic orb at second level and make it a lightening version.Kyle: Sweet.Spurrier: I lift up my shirt and say-Spurrier (as Randy) Alright, you’ve got this, right? You- you're good?Kyle (as Eddie) Yeah- Yeah, man-Spurrier (as Randy) Okay-Kyle (as Eddie) Let’s charge it up.Spurrier (as Randy) Okay cool. [Distorted] Chromatic orb!Spurrier: There it is.Goodrich: [Chuckles] And so it goes.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] Okay, that is a seventeen plus three.Kyle: [Chuckles] Yeah okay, that’s definitely going to hit.Spurrier: Okay so, since it’s a second level spell it will be 4d8-Kyle: Well, let me stop you there-Spurrier: Okay-Kyle: Because I will tell you what happens.Spurrier: [Bluntly] Oh, good.Kyle: Your ball of energy, you chromatic orb, produces as normal from your belly button I assume.Spurrier: Nicely done. Good on Eddie.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Take cover!Kyle: You see it come out and little bits of lightening are streaking off of it, coursing around it; and it goes inside and fuses into this grayish-black ooze.Spurrier: [Sighs]Kyle: And you see it swallow it up.Spurrier: Oh, bad.Kyle: But then you see this ooze split into two, and now there are two of these oozes sitting in front of you.Ali: Are they smaller than the one?Kyle: They are, they’re a little bit smaller than the last ones. The last ones were considered large, these two are medium. You can pretty much assume that this thing is immune to lightening damage.Spurrier: Of all the times- I've never done lightening once![Players laugh]Kyle: I know-Spurrier: The first time-Kyle: I- Listeners, if you could see the grin on my face when he said it, I was just like, “yes!”Goodrich: Kyle was grinning like an idiot.Kyle: Yeah!Spurrier: Of all the things- so many choices, oh well!Kyle: You still have movement left so-Spurrier: I still have movement, that’s a positive.Goodrich: And we have pass without trace active so, can Randy hide? Can we all hide? Cause we were sneaking in here.Kyle: Yeah you can try but this thing seems to oddly know exactly where you’re at.Goodrich: Oh boy-Ali: Okay, well..Spurrier: I’ll try hiding behind Yashee anyways just in case.Kyle: Go for it.Spurrier: That is a nine, plus nine, plus ten.Kyle: Okay twenty-eight, yeah.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Sweet, that’s- you know.Ali: I think at this point Raz’ul’s still taller than me.Spurrier: Oh right! Well, I'm ducking down.[Ali laughs]Spurrier: Make myself really small.Kyle: Yeah, just a little bit. Alright, if that wraps that up-Goodrich: Ha, be my shadow.Kyle: (snickers) “Well Chance.”[Goodrich laughs]Kyle: Oh, not that kind of shadow, my bad!Goodrich: Speaking of movies from the 90s.[All sigh]Kyle: Man that’s a heart- tear jerking.Goodrich: Yeah. [Shudders] [Jokingly] Trying to concentrate, Kyle!Kyle: Speaking of concentration. Yashee, it’s your turn.Ali: Since it knows where we are anyway, I'm going to try to see how it feels about some fire.Kyle: Okay.Ali: So, I’m just gonna whisper to Raz’ul-Ali (as Yashee): [Whispering] Hey, Raz’ul can you light my torch?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, uh-Kyle: [Whispering] That’s not the line you wanna say.[Ali laughs]Kyle: [Whispering] Come on Jim, come on Jim.Ali (as Yashee): [Whispering] Can you light my fire?Goodrich: [Laughs, sings] Come on Raz’ul, light my fire. I have a tinder box Kyle, is that cool?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: You can light fires with a tinder box.Goodrich: Yeah- how does that work?Ali: I don’t have a tinder box, so-Goodrich: How does that work with like, turns-Kyle: You just do it-Goodrich: Oh! Okay.Kyle: You do it.[All conversing happily]Goodrich: So I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Singing] Come on Yashee light your fire!Goodrich: I do it.Ali (as Yashee): Thanks!Kyle: Alright, you have a lit torch.Ali: How close are these things to us?Kyle: It is within ten feet of you.Ali: Alright, I'm going to go up to the one on the left and- can I have my torch in front as I inch up to them?Kyle: Yes, as you’re-[Overlapping conversation]Ali: Kind of wave it around? I wanna be on guard, you know?Goodrich: Yeah, you’re like Ian Malcom in front of the T-rex.Kyle: So, you do that and it’s like, lurching backwards kind of forming around the flames so that it doesn’t get burned. Are you trying to attack with the torch?Ali: Well, I mostly just want to see like how it seems to feel.Kyle: It doesn’t seem to like it-Ali: I mean if I had a torch of lightening it’d be like “Hey, bring that over here!”Kyle: Yeah! It would be totally down for that.Ali: So-Ali (as Yashee): [Higher pitched] It seems like he doesn’t like the fire![Players chuckle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well then, stick it in here!Ali: I just wanna throw the fire right at it- throw the torch right at it.Kyle: Give me a dexterity-based attack.[Rolls dice, chuckling and ‘awes’]Ali: Well that’s a six plus one.Kyle: That hits![Players all react in shock]Kyle: So the flame goes in-Ali: I toss it right in there.Kyle: Uhh stick of fire damage, roll me a one d4.Ali: [Rolls dice, others cheer] That’s a four! Bam!Kyle: Okay, you see this stick fly into this amorphous blob. It swallows it up just because you threw it at it and hit it. And the fire goes out but you see it kind of curl and bubble around area where the torch was.Ali: That’s it!?Kyle: Yeah definitely- what?[Players laugh]Kyle: What did you want!?Ali: I wanted it to turn like hard and molten or something! Like, Aargh!Kyle: No, it’s already a continuous viscous blob!Ali: So it just keeps being a blob.Kyle: Yeah, it bubbled a little bit like, you know- fire, it just continues- it took some damage!Ali (as Yashee): We need more heat![Players burst into more laughter]Ali (as Yashee) Bring the heat!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, Raz’ul’s coming to bring the heat. Here we go!Kyle: Bring the heat everybody. Alright Raz’ul, you’re turn.Goodrich: So, I'm gonna cast Moon Beam as a third level spell.Kyle: Mkay.Goodrich: Would you say that these two- they're right next to each other so would you say they’re in a ten foot diameter?Kyle: Yeah, they’re- It’s like a ten-foot-wide hall actually.Goodrich: Oh cool! Well I say- again, it’s a druid spell but you know, the song just works so well-Kyle: Yeah, that’s fair.Goodrich: Just for funsies so- one, two, three- [Singing while playing guitar] Moon beam, I'm casting my moon beam! A beam of silvery light that’s ten feet wide, a bright and shining cylinder that’s forty feet high! [Music stops] ‘Kay.Kyle: Okay so a circle forms at the top of this room and a silvery light begins to flow down. I imagine it looking a lot like Zordon’s-Goodrich: Yes!Kyle: Yeah! Imagine it looking a lot like Zordon’s-Goodrich: Encasing-Kyle: Encasing, yeah! So, it looks like that but without a face inside it.Goodrich: It does it just has Raz’ul’s face going- [yells][All laugh]Kyle: Yeah it can, absolutely.Goodrich: Oh, cool!Kyle: So you see Raz’ul’s face in this silvery light with this big ol’ grin with this blobs just writhing around from the energy. What kind of damage does it do? I don’t know, you have to roll it- actually no, I have to make a constitution saving throw.Goodrich: Yes please.Kyle: Hm, for both of them. [Rolls dice] How does sixteen and eleven do?Goodrich: Thirteen, so sixteen passes, eleven don’t pass.Kyle: Okay, so go ahead and roll the damage.Goodrich: Alright so it’s three d10 since its third level. [Rolls dice, chuckles] Nine, four and three.Kyle: Mkay, yeah this seems like it works out a lot better than a lightning bolt!Goodrich: And it’s also supposed to be like a ghostly flame so maybe it’s all like, kinda spooky in this cave.Kyle: Little spooky?Goodrich: Sorry, Yashee![Ali laughs]Kyle: Okay so, that wraps up your turn; you still have movement, wanna do anything else?Goodrich: Nope, I don’t think so.Kyle: Cool, cool.Goodrich: I’m cool here.Kyle: Alright, so it is my oozes turns and one of them is going to try and reach out and bap Yashee with a pseudopod, and let’s see what it can get on here. [Rolls dice] Fifteen I believe does hit.Ali: Yes.Kyle: Okay, excellent. So, it baps out and you take [rolls dice] nine bludgeoning damage from it reaching out and slapping you. And you see some of the ooze actually rest on your chest and it starts to sear through a little bit of your clothes and it starts to burn your skin really bad. Uh let’s see, there’s more damage-Ali: Ow.[Players chuckle as dice is rolling]Kyle: You take fifteen points of acid damage-Ali: Whoa!Goodrich: Yashee says, “gua-no you didn’t!”[Players chuckle]Ali: I guess I’m calling out like, “ouch!”[All laugh]Kyle: It burns!Ali (as Yashee): I’m burning over here!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It wasn’t my moon beam, was it!?Ali (as Yashee): I don’t think so!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, phew!Ali (as Yashee): It kind of spit at me!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, jeez!Ali (as Yashee): Or something!Kyle: It is the right ooze’s turn. And it’s actually just sitting there and it starts to quiver and shake and you see the surface of it start to ripple. And you just feel this immense energy rush out towards you and I need everybody to make an intelligence saving throw.[Players react in shock]Ali: I got a twelve minus one. Kyle, that’s eleven.Kyle: You’re good.Spurrier: [rolls dice, sighs] I got a three plus three.Goodrich: Wha-Kyle: We’ll see.Spurrier: Okay!Goodrich: I got a twelve plus three, fifteen.Kyle: Okay, so the miners all look like- they grab their head and are like- Oh my god what was that? [Rolls multiple dice] Yashee and Raz’ul you feel this wave come at you and it feels like somethings trying to wrap around your head, but you can’t- it doesn’t hurt you.Goodrich: It’s like we just feel a migraine coming on and you just down some ibuprofen.Kyle: Yeah!Ali: Brain freeze as well.Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: Oh, nice, nice.Ali: That’s the face I’m making.Kyle: And Randy, you feel the same feeling but actually it does hurt a little bit so you’re actually gonna take- it would be thirteen but there’s something going on here so you’re only taking six.Spurrier: Oh okay, sweet!Spurrier (as Randy) Ah! My mind![Players chuckle]Kyle: And when this happens- when this wave of force hits over you, you notice there is a small flicker of light from the runes on your instruments.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: Yeah, it’s literally just brief, shines on for just a brief moment.Goodrich: Yikes.Kyle: And that is the end of my ooze’s turns. Though we are back at the top of the action with Randy.Spurrier: Kyle, is there any sign that we’ve done any real damage to them yet?Kyle: Uh, yes-Spurrier: Like bloodied or-Goodrich: Blobbied.Kyle: [Chuckles] Blobbied.Spurrier & Goodrich: Oozed.Kyle: The one on the right looks like it- it kind of has pieces slumping off a little portion of it’s body. Seems to be a little bit drippier, and the one on the left is dripping, little bit, not as much as much on the right.Spurrier: Not as much drippage, okay.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Need to check their nasal decongestant.[All chuckle]Goodrich: Their Sudafed.Kyle: Get rid of that drip!Goodrich: Yup!Spurrier: Okay um, well now I know that lightening doesn’t work and fire does work let’s just try again. But I'm gonna do it as a first level spell.Kyle: Chromatic orb?Spurrier: Chromatic orb, yes, thank you. [Rolls dice]Kyle: Which one are you attacking? The one on the left or right?Spurrier: You said the one on the right was more drippy?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Then the one on the right please.Kyle: Mkay.Spurrier: That is a ten plus three.Kyle: That hits!Spurrier: Yay! Alright so, 3d8, so if you guys wanna toss a couple d8’s [rolls dice] it’s an eight.Goodrich: [rolls dice] One.Ali: Four!Spurrier: Fire damage I should say I guess.Kyle: Okay, so you begin casting your spell and Eddie comes out. His two little arms holding this fiery energy and serves it volleyball style.[Players laugh]Kyle: So, the ball flies over to the ooze and the ooze engulfs it and you can see the ooze boiling and crackle a little bit. And it starts to deteriorate down and it looks like really on it’s- it’s really drippy now.Spurrier: Nice.Goodrich: Gross.Kyle: Just super, super drippy. Anything else on your turn?Randy: Might as well hide behind Raz’ul.Kyle: Okay-Spurrier: You’re actually the big boy now.Goodrich: Alright!Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is a seventeen plus nine, plus ten.Kyle: Mkay, noted, and we are to Yashee, what do?Ali: So, I think I'm gonna tap out some thunder wave on these oozes.Kyle: Absolutely.Ali: Since it’s a fifteen-foot cube, can I get both of them in-Kyle: Absolutely, yeah-Ali: My path. Great! Alright, well, I'll do that! So little Yashee starts going to town. [Sound of tap shoes]Kyle: Okay so I need to make a constitution check.Goodrich: I imagine it’s like, little Yashee’s got her little galoshes on, splash, splash, splash, splash splash!Kyle: More Splash talk, huh?Goodrich: Yeah, I know.[All chuckle]Kyle: Okay, they both failed.Ali: Great, well it says- each creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed ten feet away from me.Kyle: Cool, cool. Good. For me.Ali: Oh-Kyle: Go ahead and do your damage.Ali: [Rolls dice] Seven.Kyle: Okay, the one on the right is pretty much just torn apart. Ripped apart into an oozy glob, flies backwards and splatters against the wall and it isn’t coalescing back into any kind of form.Ali: Yes!Kyle: The one on the left has shifted back ten feet. It has moved out of the moon beam and it just sits there; it looks like it’s not doing too well. So, that takes us to Raz’ul. Your turn.Goodrich: Okay yeah, it says on each of my turns after casting moon beam I can use an action to move the beam sixty-feet in any direction.Kyle: Question real quick.Goodrich: Yeah?Kyle: Does moon beam require concentration?Goodrich: [Pauses] Yes.Kyle: Cool, you’re not longer within the effects of pass without trace.Goodrich: Aw! But what if I've been doing sudoku and stuff to kinda [chuckles] keep my concentration up?Kyle: Nope-[Players chuckling]Ali: He was just waiting for that.Goodrich: I know.Spurrier: Glorious day for Kyle.Goodrich: Ally and oop.Spurrier: So I guess I had a twenty-seven for that stealth instead of a thirty-seven.Kyle: Yeah, you did. It’s okay, it didn’t result in anything so-Spurrier: Yeah that’s true.Kyle: We know now![Overlapping conversation and chuckling]Kyle: So, you move the moon beam.Goodrich: Yeah, and I just put it right over the glob-bule.Kyle: The one left.Goodrich: Yeah, the glob that got away.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: So 3d10. [Rolls dice] Oh mercy, [chuckles] that’ll be twenty-two.Kyle: Same thing, this fiery circle just moves over this glob and you just see the ghostly flames going in- and these little flames also look like Raz’ul’s face. And they go in and they just take out little bites. They just take little bites of it, swallowing it up and burning away the rest of this black ooze. And you hear Squid say-Kyle (as Squid) No! Aw, not Ivan!Spurrier: Ivan, no.[All laughing]Kyle (as Squid): I loved him![Goodrich laughs]Kyle (as Squid): You know what, Raz’ul-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): If you love him you have to let him go.Kyle (as Squid): Raz’ul you’ve gone too far. You asked for it earlier and now I'm gonna give it to you.Kyle: Go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw.Goodrich: Aw. [Rolls dice] Eighteen plus five.Kyle: You hear Squid go-Kyle (as Squid): [Straining] Okay, when your older brothers used to razz you a little bit what would they do? Come on, you can tell me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Kyle (as Squid): Come on, you can tell me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, I don’t wanna.Kyle (as Squid): Tell me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Kyle (as Squid): Tell me, I'm just gonna keep saying tell me, till you tell me, tell me-Goodrich: Did I fail?Kyle (as Squid): Tell me-Kyle: No, no, no, above table, you didn’t fail but he is insisting.Goodrich: Ooh, okay!Kyle (as Squid): I’ll just do this till you tell me.[Goodrich groaning as Kyle repeats “tell me.”]Kyle (as Squid): I will fill your head up with my own voice until you tell me what I want to know. You just keep thinking about what your brothers used to do when they made fun of you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Guys, he won’t leave me alone!Spurrier: Are we hearing all this our minds?Kyle: Yeah you all can hear this.Spurrier: Okay-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can you just-Kyle (as Squid): You can tell me. Come on, what would they do? How- What? Did they make noises like- [Repeating “Nyah” over and over] Come on, Raz’ul.Kyle: You hear Erin back there-Kyle (as Erin): Raz’ul maybe if you tell him he’ll just shut up! Ah!Goodrich: Okay, okay, okay so I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Quickly] Sometimes when I was younger and I was learning how to make potpourri and I wasn’t very good at it, it didn’t smell very good and my brother Dank’ul who was really good at making potpourri that would sometime sing a song that went, “poo poo potpourri, poo poo potpourri, looks like poo and smells like pee.”[All burst into laughter]Kyle: The miners all like, stifle laughter as they’re just like- [stifles laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s not funny! I really liked doing the potpourri.Kyle (as Erin): It’s pretty funny, Raz’ul-Kyle: And you hear Squid just say-Kyle (as Squid): Poo poo potpourri, poo poo potpourri?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Looks like poo, smells like pee-Kyle (as Squid): Looks like poo, smells like pee..[Ali laughs]Kyle (as Squid): This is an insult? On the surface? We would say, “ha! Tentacles more like eight-icles!” because of how short other people's tentacles were.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t feel so bad anymore. [laughs]Kyle (as Squid): No, it’s funny if- you don’t have tentacles so you wouldn’t understand!Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle (as Squid): Hmm.. Poo poo potpourri, poo poo potpourri, poo poo potpourri!Kyle: Kalima![All laugh]Ali (as Yashee): You know I think he’s had enough!Kyle (as Erin): Oh great now he’s on that poo poo potpourri shtick, way to go Raz’ul!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s not what I-Kyle (as Squid): Poo poo potpourri!Goodrich: Aw man-Kyle (as Squid): Poo poo potpourri!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can we- I dunno, can we play a song to get this dude to shut up? [chuckles]Kyle (as Squid): You killed my pet you poo poo potpourried, poo pooer.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Kyle (as Squid) You killed my pet! Ivan! You forgot already about my-[Players burst into laughter]Kyle (as Squid): You already- [loudly] poo poo potpourri!Spurrier: Alright let’s shut him up!Goodrich: Let’s shut him up!Goodrich: Can we do that Kyle? Can we play a song to get him to be quiet?Kyle: Yes, roll chord dice!Goodrich: Okay![Electronic music plays]Goodrich: Well, I hope you’re happy Kyle. You’ve successfully brought up suppressed memories just so you could get a song out of us.Kyle: Yeah![Players laugh]Kyle: I feel content.Spurrier: That’s a success.Ali: Major or minor, right?Goodrich: Oh, yeah.Kyle: Yup.Goodrich: Could we do major please?

Hope ya’ll enjoy and talk to you later![Music transitions]Spurrier: So all this squid action is making Eddie a little crazy, so he just reaches out and without Randy even noticing starts to hold out a very low note on the organ to drown out the squid.Kyle: [Chuckling] Okay.[Low synth note plays as drums and guitar kick in with a fast beat]Goodrich and Spurrier: Ohhh Squid E. ViciousAli: We’re serving up rhymes, they’re fresh and nutritious  Goodrich/Spurrier: Ohhh Squid E. ViciousAli: Ya got bards in your house and that’s inauspicious Goodrich/Spurrier: Ohhh Squid E. ViciousAli: You’re acting like a jerk, yeah, down right malicious Goodrich/Spurrier: Ohhh Squid E. ViciousAli: Don’t try and stop us now, you know we’re ambitious Goodrich/Spurrier:Oooh Yashee tell emOooh go and get emOooh Yashee tell emOoooooooooohhhhhh Goodrich/Spurrier: Ohhh Squid E. ViciousAli: Yeah we know this song seems quite repetitious  Goodrich/Spurrier: Oooh Squid E. ViciousAli: But you’re up in our mind, so don’t be pernicious Goodrich/Spurrier: Oooh Squid E. ViciousAli: We won’t play along cause you’re acting suspicious  Goodrich/Spurrier: Oooh Squid E. ViciousAli: So pour on some sauce, you’ll find it’s delicious  Goodrich/Spurrier:Oooh Yashee tell emOooh go and get emOooh Yashee tell emOoooooooooohhhhhhh Goodrich/Spurrier/AliOooh gonna tell yaOooh we’re coming for you Oooh gonna tell yaOoooooohhhhhh Shhhhhhhhhhhh! Kyle: Okay, so you start performing a song to drown out the noise of squids speaking inside your mind and over the course of performing it and walking down this hall you’re able to- you're able to quiet him. Eventually you notice as you come to the end of your song he’s not saying “poo poo pourri” anymore.[Players make expressions of relief]Goodrich: Maybe he just didn’t like the song. Like, “forget this I'm out.”Kyle: Moments after you stop you do hear Squid chime back in saying-Kyle (as Squid): Okay, perhaps that was a little juvenile of me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Jerk.Kyle (as Squid): I will contribute that to the remainders of Jenny in me. So, please, perhaps we can have a civil conversation. Come further.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): O..kay, Squid-E, the E stands for - ewwKyle (as Squid): I was wondering about that-[Players laugh]Kyle (as Squid): What is this E?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Err- stands for “err”Kyle (as Squid): Stands for err..is that a name of sorts that goes in-between names?Ali (as Yashee): Yes, it is a name sandwich!Kyle (as Squid): I-[Goodrich chuckling softly]Ali (as Yashee): It is my favorite type of name.[All laugh loud]Kyle (as Squid): I don’t know what a sandwich is.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aw that sucks.Ali (as Yashee): (sobbing) He doesn’t know what a sandwich is guys…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are you crying, Yashee!?[All laugh]Ali: Do I have one? I check my pockets for a- do I have a spare sandwich perhaps?Kyle: Give me a wisdom saving throw.Ali: [rolls dice] That’s a three.Kyle: You hear Squid go-Kyle (as Squid): [With realization] Oh, that’s what a sandwich is. That's..weird. I mean, maybe a different meat in between those sliced things. Maybe brain-Ali: Oh you’re reading my mind? He's seeing the images of my favorite sandwiches?Kyle: Yeah, yeah. He delved deeper into your mind to see what a sandwich is. Little curious.Goodrich: Little hungry too maybe. Little peckish.Kyle (as Squid): I am definitely hungry. Anyway-[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Squid): Speaking of hungry, you wanna come on in?Goodrich: Yeah, let’s go.Spurrier: Oh, alright.Kyle: So you had the path that opened in front of you, you can’t see anything in your way, the stream is flowing down the center.Spurrier: I’ve decided to name my zombie Gil, Zil, cause it’s a zombie Gil.Kyle: Okay!Spurrier: So, I'm gonna call Zil over and ask him to get down, and I'm gonna ride on his shoulders.Kyle: Okay, yes! Gets down on one knee and the knee becomes a little disjointed but they grab it, shake it and put it back into place. You hear a loud pop and they pat their shoulder.Spurrier: YahhhhGoodrich: Tally-ho!Spurrier: Tally-ho! On the Zil Gil.Kyle: You’re riding a Zil.Goodrich: Zilly-ho!Ali: Yashee feels very betrayed.[All chuckle]Goodrich: Aw!Ali: How dare you ride on another shoulder!Spurrier: Well, when you’re back at full size.Ali: Yeah.Goodrich: I would ride on your shoulder-Ali: I have a much better shoulder.Kyle: You walk in a ways and you enter a circular room with a large circular purple stone to the left that is set into the wall. You also notice that there is a hole in the ceiling through which water is falling.Ali: It’s just falling onto the ground?Kyle: Yup, and then it’s causing that stream to go out the door.Spurrier: I investigate the purple stone.[Players agreeing]Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, over here!Spurrier: [Rolls dice] That is a five plus one.Goodrich: I got a ten plus one.Kyle: Ten plus one.Ali: Thirteen.Kyle: Thirteen. Okay, how are you investigating this stone? What are you- trying to look at it? Are you-Spurrier: I’m gonna hope down off of Zil and have him touch it.Kyle: Okay, you have Zil touch it. He goes, puts a hand on it, nothing happens.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: Can I investigate it just from having been in the mountains and seeing lots of stones? And saying “hm, purple stone, that’s not common.”Kyle: You know it’s amethyst but it seems like there’s something off about it, like it’s not a true stone.Goodrich: ‘kay, aw I'll never be one of the people.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, it’s not a true stone, guys.Kyle: Yashee?Ali: Tap it with my hammer? Give it a little tappity-tap?Kyle: You give it a tap-tap and it resonates and kind of rings a little bit.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): yeah, it’s definitely not a true stone, guys!Ali (as Yashee): Should I tap it harder?Spurrier (as Randy): Give it a little bash.[Players agree]Ali (as Yashee): All right. Let me give it a nice little smacking.Kyle: Give me a strength check.Ali: [Rolls dice] That’s a natural twenty, guys![Chorus of “yeah” happens quickly, all laugh]Spurrier: That was the wrong one, all worked though![Chorus of “oh yeaaah”]Goodrich: Phew! Close call.Kyle: Right on, okay so, you take your hammer and you just smash-Ali: Oh plus three, sorry.[All chuckle]Kyle: Then you really smash this thing-Goodrich: You smash smash smash!Kyle: It smashes and crumbles and there’s an odd little board behind it with markings on there that are unfamiliar to you.Ali: Is it like a language?Kyle: You aren’t sure.Ali: I have- well, for comprehend language I also understand any written language that I see.Spurrier: Oh, nice.Kyle: You wanna try it?Ali: I must be touching the surface on which the words are written, so can I touch it?Kyle: You can touch it.Ali: Can we have Zil touch it first?Spurrier: Oh yeah, make sure it’s not trapped. So-Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, touch it.Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Kyle: Puts their hand on it, nothing happens.Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you, Zil.Kyle: (as Zil): [Grunts]Ali: Okay then let me see. Unless anybody else has a different idea?[Spurrier and Goodrich both say no]Ali: Let me go ahead and comprehend that language!Kyle: You put your hand on it to start the spell, but as soon as you do you see it light up to your touch.[Ali gasps in surprise]Kyle: And you notice there is a purple circular energy lift of sorts that fills up to that hole in the ceiling.Spurrier: Ooh, beam us up Yashee!Ali: I’m gonna let it go real quick.Kyle: Okay, you let it go and it continues for about like thirty seconds.Spurrier: Did all of the stuff light up? All of the words? Or the language?Kyle: Yeah everything.Ali: I still feel like I wanna know what it says.Kyle: Go ahead if you wanna use comprehend languages you can go ahead.Ali: Okay- [drum beat begins] two, three- [sings] read me something good, bow bow, read me, read me, read me, comprehend your language, yeah. [music ends] So, what does it say?Kyle: It says-Goodrich: Crimson carrots![All laugh]Kyle: It says a name that you’re not sure how to pronounce, but it basically says “Hey [slurping noise], be sure to install the crystal here.”Ali: I go ahead and tell them what it says. Along with the [slurping noise] part.[Players chuckle]Ali: All of it, I do my best with it.Goodrich: Do you wanna have Zil-Spurrier: Yeah- Can you hold your hand up to it again?Ali: Yup, whomp.Kyle: Okay, lights up purple.Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, go to the purple light.Kyle: Zil walks into the purple light and gets lifted up into the next room.Spurrier: Cool! Alright, Randy runs after him!Goodrich: Grab onto his foot as he lifts up! Ah!Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I’m Mary Poppins ya’ll!Kyle: Alright, so you all make it up into the room-Ali: Are we all going?Goodrich: Eff that, I’m not going up that hole.Ali: Should we just send you (Randy) up and make sure it’s okay?Spurrier: Yeah, and see what’s up.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Randy, what’s up there!?[Players chuckle]Kyle: You arrive into the next floor and it’s a much larger circular room, it has three paths that are covered with a large grate. However, there is another ceiling hole and again water is falling through it. What do?Spurrier (as Randy): Come on up! This thing’s pretty sweet!Ali (as Yashee): Get on up there Raz’ul and I’ll run and catch up.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you want to come with me? Cause I know you got your feelings hurt- I'll let you uh, I'll let you ride on my shoulders!Ali (as Yashee): [Excited] Oh! Can I piggy-back!?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Ali (as Yashee): Alright![Goodrich grunts]Kyle: You’re small enough, you can piggy-back now.Ali (as Yashee): Alright, let’s run!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, here we go! [grunts]Kyle: You run, get in the lift part and it pulls you up.[Players whooping and laughing]Spurrier: Are the miners up there too?Kyle: Yeah, the miners as well-Ali: Oh yeah, them![All laugh]Kyle (as Boom Queen): That was different.Kyle: And they were like holding grappling and rope, so they were just ready to climb.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Is there another one of these around here?Kyle: You look around, you don’t see another one but again there is that hole in the ceiling. Erin chimes in, she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): That’s odd, I mean that Squid guy can levitate. Why even have that? All right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Good point.Kyle: As you’re standing there talking about this you hear Squid chime into your head-Kyle (as Squid): So tell me, are the Lyreions still meddling in your affairs?Spurrier (as Randy): Who?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Kyle (as Squid): I’ll take that as no then, that’s interesting. So, the surface dwellers of the time we were originally here thought them to be angels of Altonia. You've heard Altonia before, right?[Players agree]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we checked out a book from the library.Spurrier (as Randy): We’ve been having story time.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we’ve been learning.Spurrier (as Randy): Learning, yes.Kyle (as Squid): Good, well really, they were imposters. Here to sow seeds that would bring about your end. They claimed to have brought the voice of the world as a gift to the people of this world, that it would protect them, protect their planet. But they knew someone would misuse it. They had planned that from the beginning. So, a little bit for you if you’re not really sure who they are.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bummer, I guess.Kyle (as Squid): Yeah, see now, I know I may not seem like from this world but you can trust- I'll be honest. I'm not gonna lie to you like they lied to your ancestors. I mean, liars right in the name.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Squid): I mean, how could they miss that, right?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Squid): Like I said, I'm not gonna lie to you. I'm going to eat your brains. See? Not lying!Ali: (as Yashee): Oh, well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Groovy, okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Appreciate the honesty.Kyle (as Squid): Oh yeah, absolutely.Spurrier (as Randy): Gonna eat the brains now? Later?Kyle (as Squid): Oh, when you’re ripe.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh okay! Good, good, good. We've got some time.Kyle (as Squid): Mhm!Spurrier (as Randy): Do you know when we’ll be ripe? Do we have a date stamped on us or anything?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do we have an expiration date?Kyle: You don’t hear a response.[Players sigh and groan in disappointment]Kyle: So, you’re in this second area. You wanna investigate around or anything or how are you going to proceed?Goodrich: Can I do perception instead of investigation?Kyle: Yes, you can.Goodrich: [Rolls dice] Nineteen plus five.Ali: I got a seventeen.Spurrier: Ninteen plus one.Kyle: Okay, so you investigate around and of the three grates, you can tell that they don’t really lead anywhere. There is however the middle grate, there’s a curve around, it looks like you can see the end of it.Ali: But there’s a grate blocking it?Kyle: Yeah, there’s a giant metal grate over it, like a sewer grate.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well great.Spurrier (as Randy): Trish you still got anything that goes boom?Kyle (as Boom Queen): Uh yeah, lemme check real quick and see what I got here.Kyle: She reaches back into a bag and just pulls out this bob-omb looking bomb.[All laugh]Kyle: I’m just gonna go with it.Goodrich: Okay! It's already lit.Kyle: Yeah, it’s already lit! Rolls it on over there and large explosion [boom] the grate kind of like sits there for a moment after all the dust and debris clears and then it just- [squeaks and a clatter] lands and it’s open.Spurrier (as Randy): Nice!Ali (as Yashee): Perfect!Goodrich: It’s like The Brave Little Toaster where the a/c explodes and it’s just..[Ali chuckling] super scary.Kyle: Nah it’s not really scary, it’s more comical.Goodrich: You scared me talking about it, like I immediately thought of that.Kyle: Sounds traumatizing.Goodrich: Yup!Kyle: [laughs] So yeah, there’s that open now.Goodrich: Okay um- his mustache was made of grates, that’s why- let's go inside!Kyle: You get around the corner that was there that was blocking your end of the tunnel vision and you notice that there’s kind of the remnants of a body? Like, really really old dusty bones-Goodrich: Dry Bones?[Soft chuckling]Kyle: And there’s a little glint hiding in the pile of bones.Goodrich: Loot!Spurrier (as Randy): Oh uh, Zil, can you go dig around in those bones? Find me that glint.Kyle: Zil goes over and starts-Goodrich: Eating the bones?Kyle: No, he doesn’t start eating the bones.Goodrich: [Pretends to loudly chew]Kyle: He starts [groans] and clears it out and he’s holding a flask and he turns around and holds it up.Kyle (as Zil): [groans triumphantly]Spurrier (as Randy): Gil, can you pass that on over here please?Kyle: He walks over and hands it to you.Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you, Gil.Spurrier: Okay, I'm gonna investigate the flask. [Rolls dice] That is a thirteen plus one.Kyle: Okay, you look at this flask, it's an iron flask and it has a bronze stopper on it; and on the flask there is an upside down “A” with a tilda going through the a hole- yes I know what I said.[All laugh]Goodrich: I think it’s the “I” epicure? I don’t know-Ali: Is there anything in the flask?Spurrier: Yeah, is there anything in there?Kyle: Doesn’t feel like there is.Spurrier: I’m gonna open it up.Kyle: Okay, you open up the flask and you hear like the faintest whisper of winds coming from inside.Ali: It’s like a seashell.Kyle: A little bit, yeah.Goodrich: [Laughing] Hold it up to your ear.Spurrier: Ooh!Goodrich: I can hear the booze.[All laugh]Goodrich: I can hear the hooch callin’Kyle: So yeah, that’s all you hear.Spurrier: Alright, well I'll close it back up and hang onto it for now I guess.Kyle: Okie-dokie.Goodrich: Ooh, that’s probably what we’re gonna use to like, suck up Squid Vicious or something- Or! Maybe it’s his pokeball?Spurrier: That’s right!Ali: Get in the flaskGoodrich: Like a freaky Tentacruel.[All laugh]Spurrier: Alright well there’s nothing-Kyle: Dead ends there.Spurrier: I guess we’ll go up? Through the hole? Where the waters coming from?Goodrich: Yeah, we can get back in that other room and make some like dopes on ropes.Kyle: And the miners are just like, “yeah let’s get on up there” and they throw up their grappling hooks, get ‘em taught, they shimmy on up.Ali: Grappling hook!Spurrier: Acrobatics!Kyle: Go ahead, yeah, see how sweet you can get up this rope.[Dice rolling throughout]Spurrier: An eleven plus nine.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Oh, nineteen!Kyle: Rolling fire today-Goodrich: Plus one! Twenty!Ali: Mines eleven plus four, fifteen.Kyle: Okay you all manage to get up the ropes deftly.Goodrich: Can we just walk up like Batman and Robin in the old 60s one where they’re just standing on the wall?Kyle: Even though there’s not a wall?Goodrich: Pretending!Kyle: Yes, yes you can. So you climb up into a room that extends out into a kidney shape and you notice that the stream of water’s flowing from the other side of this room. There is another hole that’s above you as you enter in but you can see at the end of the hallway that there’s barely a door and a half. You just imagine you can't see the other half of the door just because of the curvature of the room.Spurrier: Mhm..Kyle: There are a few long tables that have straps on them, one of them you see a Gil person strapped to and it looks like they’ve been eviscerated.[Players react in shock]Ali: Does he have his brains?Kyle:...No. There are no brains.Ali: He was right, he was right!Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, cover your eyes!Kyle: Gil covers his eyes- [groans][All laugh]Kyle: So you see this- you notice there’s a few pedestals with glass domes, some are broken, some intact, as you walk further into the room- or I assume you walk further into the room?Spurrier: Yeah, we’ll see what’s going on.Goodrich: Yup.Kyle: Okay, so you walk further into the room and you can actually see three doors at the end of this hallway. One on the left, one in the middle and one on the right. You notice that there’s another waterfall coming from the room in the middle. The rooms look very shallow, they’re very very small, you can actually see the end of them, and it’s just a small circular room, each of them are. So, the miners went up ahead of you, and they’re walking forward- they’re adamant about following this water path. And there’s a circular table that Trish is standing near and you notice there’s a bunch of inlays in it and there are two hexagonal stones that are placed in these inlays. Trish grabs one and you see her go catatonic in a way, and seize and then drop the stone and it breaks. And you see her, she’s just freaking out and stuttering and mumbling like-Kyle (as Boom Queen): [Stuttering] D-did anybody else see that?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are you okay?Spurrier (as Randy): What happened?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You look like you freaked out there for a second.Kyle: So she’s pointing and she’s like-Kyle (as Boom Queen): That- I-..I saw- I saw a vision and I-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’d you see? We’ve seen plenty of those.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Well, is saw another one of those squid guys and they were- it looked like they were starting to make markings, like butcher markings on a dwarf.[Goodrich gasps in disgust]Ali (as Yashee): Oh like, the different parts?Kyle (as Boom Queen): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, like marking the-Ali (as Yashee): The different cuts.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Shudders] A dwarf sandwich.Kyle: And she looks over at the eviscerated Gil-Kyle (as Boom Queen): A little like that, but with markings.[Goodrich makes disgusted groan]Kyle: She’s like-Kyle (as Boom Queen): I don’t know about that other stone but ya’ll, I wouldn’t recommend it.Ali (as Yashee): Nose goes.[All chuckle]Goodrich: I put my hand on my nose!Spurrier: I- oh!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s you, Zil!Ali (as Yashee): Sorry, Zil!Kyle: Zil picks it up, there’s nothing really happening.Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, you hang onto that.Kyle: Zil is just holding it.Spurrier: Perfect, alright! We can bring it with us in case we need it.Goodrich: Sweet.Spurrier: I say we follow the water?Ali: Alright.Spurrier: yeah, that seems to be our M.O. here.Goodrich: Let’s do it.Kyle: Erin chimes in-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, that’s our plan.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You good to go, Trish? Boom Queen? You feelin-Kyle (as Boom Queen) Yeah, I think I'll uh [chuckles] I think I can muster together- [sighs] that was weird.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): yeah.Kyle (as Boom Queen): That was real weird.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah the three of us have been waist deep in real weird ever since we started this trip but, onwards and upwards![All agree]Kyle: Alright so, the miners are getting their gear ready and they’re getting the grappling hooks grappled back up so they can toss them back up there. And while they’re doing that you hear Squid come back in and says-Goodrich: [Sighs deeply]Kyle (as Squid): So, I understand now that it’s been long enough, perhaps the Lyreions are not around anymore but again, honesty is important here. They approached us about being members of people who operated the voice of the world. They promised at least a person from every race on this world would have a hand in guiding it, controlling it, whatever it was, they wouldn’t share specifics. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to glean specifics and that was the one thing that really deterred us from working with them was we couldn’t, how do I put this? Tap their mind the way we could tap the others of this planet. So, no pun intended, with that in mind we couldn’t accept their offer. And we wouldn’t.Spurrier (as Randy): So, what did you do?Kyle (as Squid): We let them deceive your ancestors and when time came, we fled this planet.Ali (as Yashee): [Sarcastic] Thanks a lot!Spurrier (as Randy): [Sarcastic] Yeah, appreciate it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You guys are a bunch of fish sticks![All chuckle]Kyle (as Squid): Again, this is on your ancestors. You were the ones who ruined your own world, again, surprised that there are even any of you left. But that’s fine, nothing wrong with curiosity going both ways-Kyle: And you hear that same [slurping noise] again.[Spurrier shudders]Kyle: A little purr.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Applesauce to this guy, dude. What’s his deal?Spurrier (as Randy) Well, he’s gonna eat our brains eventually so.Goodrich: Yeah. He’s like Hannibal like, trying to get to know us first before he eats us. It’s kind of weird.Ali: It’s like, fattening up an animal.Goodrich: But he’s like, fattening up our minds.Ali: Yeah, trying to get our thinkers working.Kyle: Ooh, good thinking!Goodrich: Oh my gooosh.Kyle: You’re hitting the nail on the head.Goodrich: Let’s just ignore this guy whenever he comes back in next time. I might try that.Ali: Do we have any little metal hats we can wear ?Goodrich: Yeah, do the miners have any metal hats we can wear?Ali: Hard hats?Kyle: No, they don’t have hard hats.Goodrich: What?Ali: Any hard hats lying around?Kyle: No, no there’s no hard hats. This entire area as you’ve been walking through it looks more like that swirling purple stone. It's very alien-like.Ali: I should have a hard hat in my disguise kit still.Kyle: You have a hard hat but it’s- okay- [Ali laughs] you can try to put it on if you want to.Goodrich: Actually, I have a mess kit and that should have a steel pot and I want to put it on my head.Ali: I’m gonna put my hard hat on.Kyle: Go for it.Ali: And I’m gonna put the mustache on too just cause.[Players chuckle]Goodrich: Do you guys have a mess kit too? Cause you can just put a pot on your head.Spurrier: Nope!Goodrich: Oh, that sucks.Ali: No.Goodrich: Well-Ali: You’d think I'd have a mess kit!Goodrich: Yeah, you would.Ali: but-Goodrich: Maybe this whole time you’ve just been borrowing mine.Ali: I mean I have plenty of spoons.Kyle: You definitely don’t have a spoon in yours anymore.Goodrich: Yeah, for sure.[All laugh]Goodrich: I take out the metal bowl from my mess kit that I sometimes use for potpourri and then I stick it on my head and tie it down with some rope.Kyle: Okay, you do that.Goodrich: Yes, remember that, Kyle! Next time friggin’ Squid Vicious comes on the intercom!Kyle: Sure, okay. I’ll remember you have a bowl on your head.Goodrich: Alright-Spurrier: Keep on climbing!Kyle: Alright so, roll those climb checks, see if you can get up the- you know, the miners have managed to throw their grappling hooks up there, you got some way to climb up there. So give me those checks.[Multiple dice rolling]Ali: Sixteen plus four so twenty.Spurrier: That is a three plus nine, twelve.Goodrich: Athletics so, five plus three.Kyle: It’s not too difficult to climb on this rope so I'm gonna say you climb it with a little bit of difficulty like-Goodrich: There’s water coming down-Kyle: Yeah exactly, it makes it a little bit slippery.Spurrier: Well you’re wearing a pot on your head.Goodrich: Yeah, so I can’t see too. And it’s probably raining on the pot and it’s really loud so I'm like- [grunts] aw jeez.Kyle: Okay so, you make your way up following this whole stream of water and come into a small oval room. You all see three containment units that are set in the wall. Two are larger, ones smaller and there’s an exit to your left, which is also where the water is flowing from. You notice that the two containment units are open and empty, the smaller one is closed though and you hear Squid come in and say-Kyle (as Squid): I wouldn’t open that; you would be wasted on that.Ali: We allll hear that?Kyle: Yeah you all hear that-Ali: Even some of us with hats on?Kyle: All of you hear it, even with hats on.[Players sigh in disappointment]Kyle: You can try.Ali: I’m gonna leave my hat on.Goodrich: Me too.Ali: What did he say? I wasn’t listening-[All laugh]Kyle (as Squid): You shouldn’t open that; I'd hate for you to be wasted on it. You're for me.Goodrich: But he did say he’s being honest right? So-Spurrier: I think it might be best just to-Ali: Can we look in it? Like, not open it but-Spurrier: Like, see through?Kyle: It’s not- it's like clouded over and really dusty.Ali: Hmm..so curious-Goodrich: Yeah, I'm not touching it.[All agreeing]Goodrich: He’s been pretty honest.Spurrier: For someone that says their gonna eat your brain.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean Yashee, you’re free to look in there if you want to-Ali: Well, what are the other containment things? Are they just empty?Kyle: They’re just empty and they look like they could fit a standard size humanoid in them.Ali: Oh, okay.Kyle: You hear Squid say-Kyle (as Squid): The next room I think you’ll find interesting. Your companion- that's not right, doesn’t feel right based on what you’re thinking- Jermaine came down last night-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh! Jermaine! That’s who's book we’re borrowing, we’re just here to give it back to him.Kyle (as Squid): Well, you won’t be giving it to him. I mean, it may look like him still but- heh, he was into some weird things while he was down here. Interesting fellow, and he gave me quite a bit of information. But he seemed dedicated which is why I decided to turn him.Ali (as Yashee): Instead of eating his brains?Kyle: (as Squid): Yeah, some people earn their right. Maybe you will, maybe you won’t.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That sucks.Spurrier (as Randy): We’ll go say hi I guess?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, let’s go.Kyle: Mkay, you walk in and it’s a short hallway that enters into a room that extends left and right. You can see that there are several of the same containment units that you just saw in the previous room that are installed into the wall. A number of them are empty save for two. And there are passages to the left and you see there’s a port hole that you could go left through or there’s a passage you could go right through. The water seems to be streaming from the left- or doesn’t seem to be- the water IS streaming from the left. And you hear the sounds of a waterfall coming from that direction as well.Spurrier: Water? Water-Spurrier & Goodrich: Everywhere-Spurrier: Let’s follow it cause that’s why we’re here?Ali: Nothing looks suspicious about the one on the right? It's just there?Kyle: You can see it goes up hill.Ali: Okay.Kyle: It actually climbs.Ali: Water.Goodrich: Water?Spurrier: Water!Goodrich: H20![Ali giggles]Goodrich: Ga-tor-adeKyle: You walk in that direction and you can actually see inside of one of the containment units closed. You see a figure standing in there.Goodrich: Is it Jermaine shaped?Kyle: You don’t know, it looks like a humanoid.Ali: I’m gonna knock on it-Ali (as Yashee): Hello![Players laugh]Kyle: You just see a hand press up against it-Ali: [yells]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, look out!Kyle: And it smears down the glass.Goodrich: Like in Titanic?Kyle:...Yeah, but not sexy.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Do you do it back to them but like, on the outside?Ali: I’m scared a little bit- no!Goodrich: All Star Trek style?Ali: I think you hear Yashee let out like a blood-curdling scream.Goodrich: Oh no!Kyle: Yeah?Ali: I can’t do it.Goodrich: Do it.Ali: It’s too high.Kyle: Yashee screams out and-Ali: [Screams]Kyle: And you all turn to notice there’s a hand pressed up against the containment glass.Ali (as Yashee): There’s someone in there![Goodrich and Spurrier gasp in shock]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Is it Jermaine?Ali (as Yashee): I don’t know!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s open it up.Ali (as Yashee): Are you Jermaine!?Kyle: And there’s no response really, you just see that hand resting there.Goodrich: Aw jeez..Ali (as Yashee): Anyone else? Anyone else wanna look at it?Kyle: You wanna try to open it up? I thought I heard somebody say that.Goodrich: I open it up.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Guys, get behind me.Ali: Maybe we should have stuff ready in case it-Goodrich: Oh, we should have Zil open it!Spurrier: Yeah okay, well let's all have our weapons ready and drawn.Kyle: Zil goes over and tries to open it up, let’s see what happens here..Zil goes over-Goodrich: Zil explodes!Kyle: And like tries getting a grip on each side of it where it’ll pull down. And it starts to pull down a little bit from the top down and Zil’s pulling really hard, one of his arms slips just like, sluggish and then the other one kind of just rips off of his body and stays hanging there, and he looks for a second, reaches up, grabs his arm and tries to just place it back on there sticking it in but it doesn’t- sticks it there, lets go and it just falls to the ground and it looks down at it like-Kyle (as Zil): [Groans]Ali (as Yashee): Don’t give up, try twisting it! Sometimes you just gotta find the right way to get it. I've had this problem before.Kyle (as Zil): [Enthusiastic groan]Kyle: And he gestures towards Randy. He looks at you and waves his single hand-Kyle (as Zil): [Happy groaning]Kyle: At Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah it’s fine, you can leave it.Goodrich: Was that the one that was holding the hexagonal thing? It didn’t break, did it? [silence] Kyle!?Kyle: I forgot about that.Spurrier: Does he have like, pockets or anything?Kyle: Yeah he put it in his pocket before. It's like a tunic but you know, it’s got a pocket for the hexagonal stone.Spurrier: Okay, perfect! Should we keep going?Goodrich: Does it seem like the persons still alive in thereKyle: Yeah I mean, they put there hand up there.Ali: Maybe we could just peak in a little bit?Goodrich: Well none of us are tall enough anymore.Ali: How tall is it?Kyle: Oh you know, it stands about seven feet tall but there’s some steps nearby like, stepstools that are built into the thing.Goodrich: They’re very courteous here.Kyle: It’s more so just the design, the way the place is designed. Everything really curved, there’s a lot of you know, circles, ovals, and stuff like that so the wall is a little bit curved, you could probably work your way up with the grooves that are in there and everything.Goodrich: We could just break the glass with a spell, how does Eddie feel about that? Just kidding, just kidding!Spurrier: He’s probably tired.Kyle: You could break the glass with the axe that you have that you’ve never attacked with![All laugh]Goodrich: Okay so uh- I have attacked with it! I've waited just a long time Kyle.Ali: Remember the second episode?Goodrich: Okay I’ll stand up and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I do have an axe so-Goodrich: I swing it off my back, into my hands and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Heeere’s Raz’ul!Ali: Can you just use it and like, pull it down-Kyle: That’s not what he said he did-Goodrich: I’m breaking it.Ali: Okay.Kyle: He broke the glass and- you break the glass and Jermaine falls out-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa, I got you buddy!Kyle: And he’s kind of oozy covered-Spurrier: Gross.Kyle: Naked, and you look at his face and see- and you can tell there’s something underneath his cheek wriggling around.Goodrich: Ugh!Kyle: And you see it wriggle for a moment and then disappear.Goodrich: I reach in to try to grab it.Kyle: It’s under his skin.Goodrich: [Surprised] Oh!Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jermaine-Goodrich: I smack him on the face.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jermaine, Jermaine!Kyle: No response, he is out.Goodrich: I do CPR now![Players chuckle]Kyle: You do CPR- as you’re doing CPR-Goodrich: It doesn’t try to get in my mouth, does it?Kyle: No, no, It's under his skin.Goodrich: Okay, phew.Kyle: You haven’t seen what it may be. But you’re giving CPR-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Don’t you die on me!Kyle: Yashee and Randy, you notice as he’s giving CPR- Randy, is there anything about Jermaine you’d like to check out?Spurrier: Uh, his bandage.Kyle: It’s not there, man. It's not there. You know what is though? It's a symbol for a cult that you recognize. The cult of Daris Mur, that same symbol that you found on the pendant back in Wesley’s place.All: oooh![Goodrich frantically pretending to give CRP]Kyle: At this point you actually hear Squid Vicious walkthrough through the hallway from the left. He walks up and says-Kyle (as Squid): you’ve disrupted his sleep, his transformation, this can’t be. And you seem to be surprised by that symbol on him. Any reason why? Do you know anything about…Delerim I think it was is who sent him here?Ali (as Yashee): Delerim!S&G (as Randy and Raz’ul): Delerim!Ali (as Yashee): We’ve heard that!Kyle (as Squid): Good job, Yashee.Spurrier (as Randy): You can read minds, I can imagine you already know the score.Kyle (as Squid): Well yes, I'm just making sure. Are you followers like he was a follower? Abandoning the post to do what his master wanted him. This is why I've decided to transform him, he will be good for us.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, we’ve got a pendant but no, not super savvy on his people. Again, I'm sure you know this but,you know-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We met a guy named Wesley.Ali (as Yashee): He did experiments.Kyle (as Squid): Yes, Wesley passed along the message from Delerim to him. They were thinking that, like you did, that a meteorite had landed. He was sent here to try to reclaim some materials that might have helped them in their experiment. He doesn’t know what the experiment is unfortunately, so I don’t either. But whatever it is, they’re really happy to get at it. Even disobeying bureaucratic law according to your surface government. People are strange.Goodrich: When you’re a stranger! Like you, buddy!Kyle (as Squid): I think we’ve had enough conversation. I think you’re ripe enough-Spurrier: That was quick.Ali (as Yashee): I don’t feel ripe at all! In fact I- you know- I'm still a little green!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee hasn’t even grown up yet!Ali (as Yashee): I mean look at me, I'm all green!Kyle (as Squid): Oh no, I can sense the perfect mixture of chemicals released in your brain for the perfect meal. Now, for the easy part.Kyle: Squid crosses their arms over their chest grabbing their shoulders, Squid’s eyes close and his brow furrows. They quickly undo their arms and put them outstretched in your direction. A wave of energy fills the room, washing over everyone. Big Shot, Boom Queen, and Whimpy look dazed and then suddenly collapse to the ground unconscious but you three don’t feel anything. It's as if nothing happened at all. You look towards the miners then look towards each other, and as you’re looking at each other you notice that your instruments are glowing, and those runes that had appeared before on your neck in the song previous to this episode; you notice those are glowing as well. You kind of have the same sense that you had earlier when the oozes had done a psychic attack on you, but you’re not feeling anything. You're feeling the sensation but not the pain, especially you Randy, having actually felt the pain of it before.Spurrier: Phew.Kyle: And at this point it’s when Squid in this moment looks very confused and says-Kyle (as Squid): [Panicked] This has only happened one time- this can’t- no- I was able to- you're not one of them are you?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Probably not.Spurrier: Hopefully.Kyle: We’ll have to find out next time!Goodrich: Aw!Kyle: Or maybe not! We’ll see!-----Transcripts by: Gabi CardoneTwitter: @peachdoodles"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-19-one-way-or-another,Episode 19 – One Way or Another,"Episode 19 – One Way or Another[Theme music plays]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome back to BomBARDed. I’m gonna recap last episode real quick so we can get into the mix of things. So last time, we began with our adventurers going into Squid Vicious’s lair, and Squid had mentioned that their pet Ivan was going to be meeting them. So as they entered in, they saw this weird kind of viscous, grayish-black liquid that lined the walls of the hallway they were in. Eventually, this wound up creeping after Yashee had thrown one of Rhiannon’s fingers at it and it ate that finger.Ali: I picked it up.Kyle: Which specifically was the index finger; it is important for me to note that.Goodrich: Saving that middle one for Squid.Kyle: There you go.[Players chuckle] Kyle: So that happened, and this ooze-like being coalesced into being in front of you, blocking your passageway. And after a little bit of fighting with it, Randy, you accidentally split it in half by throwing some lightning at it.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: And after some fire, some Thunderwave, some Moonbeaming, these two eventually just were defeated. And Squid was quite upset with this and began to irritate you – specifically Raz’ul – and trying to figure out, what was it that your brothers did to really grind your gears?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And this eventually led to Squid just berating you mentally and saying things over and over like “poo-poo-purri.”Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So you guys did what you do best and-Goodrich: It definitely didn’t feel like you, Kyle.Kyle: No, no, no. No, not me at all.Goodrich: You would never talk to me like that, right?Kyle: I wouldn’t do that to you.Goodrich: Thanks, Kyle.Kyle: So this led to you guys making a song to be able to just really drown out Squid’s voice, and Squid eventually decided “okay, maybe I was being childish. Please, come on and let’s talk. Let’s be a little bit more civil.”Goodrich: Yeah, Gambin-go-away … that doesn’t work. Never mind. Childish…yeah, do. [Players laugh] Really bad.Kyle: So you ventured further into Squid’s lair and made it through a few rooms, one of which you found that flask that I had mentioned.Spurrier: Sounded kind of windy or something.Kyle: Yeah, yeah, had that weird sound when you opened it up. But as you were making your way through, Squid was talking to you, and he brought up many different points, but the most notable one of them was the existence of these celestial beings called the Lyreions. They had gifted the surface dwellers something called the Voice of the World, although Squid didn’t seem to really know what it was, but he believed they were doing so with malicious intent. Squid also mentioned that they couldn’t be trusted, and – just because they couldn’t read their minds. So as you were going through these rooms, you eventually found yourself in this longish room that had these containment units in them. And this is where you found Jermaine’s body inside one of these containment units – you managed to get it open – and there was something wriggling, crawling underneath his skin.Spurrier: Gross.Kyle: And as you were – yeah, absolutely. As you were investigating this, this is when Squid came up and actually caught you off guard. Squid tried to pull off some kind of scionic move that hindered your brain or, you know, knocked you out. It knocked out the other miners, but it didn’t seem to have an effect on you three.Goodrich: We’re all over eighteen.Kyle: That’s right. [Snickers] So this caught Squid Vicious by surprise, and they seemed really confused by it. So that’s pretty much where we picked up, with Squid Vicious being like, “You aren’t – no.”Goodrich: No.Spurrier: Yes, maybe. Of course.Kyle: “Or are you.” So let’s go ahead and pick up there.Goodrich: Can I just say, you remember when our biggest problem was like Gareth? [Players laugh] But Kyle, actually, can I – well, okay. I wanna sneak out my Ira Glass and like kind of purposefully butt-dial Splash so that he can, like, listen in on this conversation we’re probably about to have. Can I do like a sleight of hand just to kind of pull out my Ira Glass and pull it up to my mouth and just go-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Coughing] Symbol!Goodrich: -and just try to activate it so that Splash can hear and-Kyle: Give me a sleight of hand check real quick.Goodrich: [rolls dice] Thirteen plus one for Jack of All Trades, fourteen.Kyle: Okay. So you slip it out, you’re palming it pretty well. You think you’ve got it hidden, so you say – you can cough and say “Symbol.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Coughs] Symbol! [continues coughing]Kyle: And you hear a “hello?”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Surprised noise]Goodrich: And I put it back in my pocket.Kyle: Uh-Goodrich [as Raz’ul]: Sorry guys. I had a – it’s a little stuffy in here, my allergies are kicking up, so…Goodrich: But I’m glad the reception down here worked for reaching Splash, so…Kyle: So yeah, as you’re doing this, Squid’s still looking very confused. And you begin to hear Squid speak-Kyle (as Squid): No, you aren’t them, because this – this works.Kyle: And Squid points back and forth between your heads and theirs.Kyle (as Squid): And then also, there’s the qua- Kyle: Before they finish that word, you hear this other voice in your head that goes-Kyle (as other voice): Return to me!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aaah!Spurrier (as Randy): Whoa!Ali (as Yashee): Ohoho!Kyle: And Squid instantly – you see their eyes just beam open, and they lift up and float backwards through the door that they came through. And the door spirals closed, cutting off the path of the water, so that water stream is no longer there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What!?Ali: I call out –Ali (as Yashee): Hey, where you goin’? Wait![Goodrich sighs]Kyle: No response.Goodrich: So you said it spirals closed. Is it like a portal that closed or-Kyle: No, it’s more like a dilating door, where it’s just – you know.Goodrich: Oh, okay.Kyle: Closes in a circle.Goodrich: Kinda like in Golden Eye and stuff.Kyle: Yeah, the cavern.Ali: Ahh.Goodrich: Like a sphincter.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah, like a sphincter.Ali: I guess like a sphincter.Goodrich: Yeah, but that’s really what it’s called. That’s like the term for those-Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: -right?Kyle: Yes, it is.Ali: Sphincter says what?[Players laugh]Goodrich: Oh boy!Kyle: So at this point, the door in front of you is closed, the stream of water is no longer pouring through it. The miners are on the ground unconscious, and I need everybody to make a perception check.Spurrier: And we’re still in the room where we found Jermaine?Kyle: Jermaine, yes.Spurrier: Okay, cool.[Multiple dice rolls]Ali: That’s a sixteen plus one.Spurrier: That is an eighteen plus three.Goodrich: Thirteen plus five.Kyle: Sweet. You all hear this. Behind you and through the passage that was to your right when you entered, you hear the pitter-patter of fishy feet.[Spurrier chuckles]Ali: Aww.Goodrich: That’s not a phrase you hear often, “fishy feet.”Kyle: Yeah.[Imitation of wet footsteps and bubbles]Ali: Like shoes that have been like soaked in a puddle and are all squishy?Goodrich: Oh, okay.Kyle: No, it sounds more like slapping.Ali: Oh.Goodrich: Oh.[Imitation of bubbles]Goodrich: Okay.Ali: Okay, well.Goodrich: And I call out and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bleep blop bloop bloop!Goodrich: -or whatever you said the other episode.[Players laugh]Kyle: That’s actually it, I think. I think that’s exactly what I said.Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah, I think it is.Spurrier: You’re fluent! Nice!Goodrich: Oh boy! I’m learning.Kyle: Uh, there’s no response.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier: We’re still hearing the pitter-patter though?Kyle: Oh, no. It eventually stops.Spurrier: Oh, okay, okay. I was gonna say.Ali: Did it sound like it was like coming and going, like, got louder?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Right.Kyle: So – also, miners are unconscious on the ground.Spurrier: I was about to ask.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: What do? Goodrich: Well, and also, Yashee, I got something for your – what ails ya, your – because you got, you’re down hit points, right? So I-Ali: Yeah, I’m down quite a few actually.Goodrich: Yeah. I know Cure Wounds, so do you mind if I – we could do like a Sistine Chapel, just like touch each other’s finger.[Ali giggles]Goodrich: -Ooouuuch – and then I can heal you. Ali: Alright. I’m bringing it in. Here we go.Goodrich: Here we go.Spurrier: Well, actually, since Yashee is so low, I’ve got the same spell. I’ll have to play it, but we can get like all three, all of our hands in there.Goodrich: We could do a Rock Circle![Players exclaim]Goodrich: Yes!Kyle: Definitely.Goodrich: So also, real quick, I mean – a Rock Circle, for those – well, I guess for everyone, really – whenever we’re done, as Lindby, playing a show, and we’re about to leave and go home, we do a thing where we, you know, create your “rock,” you know-Spurrier: -where you’re holding up your index and pinky finger.Ali: Rock hands.Goodrich: And then we interlock them, and you know, we say “rock circle, 3, 2, 1”-[Goodrich and Ali yell]Spurrier: You feel this surge of power.Goodrich: Feel the electricity, yeah.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: So man, in-game Rock Circle!Kyle: It’s like a Chain Lightning spell.Goodrich: Yeah, it’s so awesome! Okay, so yeah. So do you want to play yours, I guess?Spurrier: Sure. I suppose I should do that. So Randy pulls out his organ, gets ready for some healing magic.Kyle: Oh yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): [singing, accompanied by keyboard] Healing up Yashee-Ali (as Yashee): Oh!Spurrier (as Randy): [singing] -Making her so fresh and healthy. Yashee’s gonna be so free! [music ends] Ah.Ali (as Yashee): [Refreshed] Ah.Kyle: Nice.Goodrich: And mine’s a druid spell, so I just say“uhh.”Spurrier: You just do it.Kyle: Sweet.Goodrich: Boop. So here we go. Rock it up.Kyle: Yashee, *time to get some healing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Get ready for the Rock circle in 3-Goodrich and Spurrier: -2, 1-[Players yell together]Ali [as Yashee]: Wow guys. I feel so much better now. Thanks so much!Goodrich: Let’s see-Spurrier: Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Like a whole new Yashee!Spurrier: Let’s see if you actually do feel better. We roll-Ali (as Yashee): Oh wait (fakes a cough] I don’t know yet.Goodrich: So I’m doing mine just as a first-level.Spurrier: Yeah, same, since we’re both doing it. And mine’s gonna be a 1D8 plus three.Goodrich: Mine’s 1D8 plus two!Kyle: Right on.Goodrich: Here we go.[Multiple dice rolls]Spurrier: That is a five plus three.Goodrich: And mine’s a six plus two.Ali: Alright.Kyle: Alright, eight, eight, sixteen.Ali: Pretty nice!Goodrich: Alright!Ali (as Yashee): I do feel better!Goodrich: Hurray!Spurrier: Hurray!Ali (as Yashee): Sixteen points better, to be exact.[Players chuckle]Kyle: Okay. So you’ve healed Yashee a little bit. Again, there are three unconscious miners on the ground.Goodrich: I slap all three of them, right across the face.Ali: Can we go shake them a little bit?Ali (as Yashee): Hey!Kyle: You shake them.Ali (as Yashee): Wake up.Kyle: Who are you shaking, Yashee?Ali: All of them. No.Goodrich: Sh-sh-sh.Kyle: All of them at once? You just put them in a pile and shake them all.Goodrich: Aww.Ali: I’ll go up to Erin. I feel closer to her.Kyle: Okay. So you go up to Erin and shake her, and she kinda-Kyle (as Erin): [sleepily] What? Oh!Kyle: She grabs her head and rubs it really hard. You can see she looks like she’s in pain. And her eyes open and they’re very – just, the pupils are dilated like crazy, swimming around, trying to gain focus. And then finally, it looks like she’s looking at you, and and she’s like-Kyle (as Erin): [groans] What just happened?Goodrich: Oh boy. So, good news/bad news, again. Good news: Squid’s gone. Bad news: so is the water. Aaaand…Ali (as Yashee): You got mind-slapped. He just came and slapped your mind.Kyle (as Erin): Mind-slapped. Oh, yeah, that’s about what it feels like. Man! Where’s Trish and Wimpy? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, over here. They’re also passed out.Goodrich: I slap them again.Kyle: They kinda stir and wake up, and both of them react the same way as Erin did. And they all look just wrecked.Goodrich: Hmm.Kyle: They do not look in a good way.Goodrich: Ah.Kyle: So – and Raz’ul, as you’re shaking Boom Queen – Boom Queen, when she comes to, she’s-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Raz’ul, is your butt talking?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What? Oh, because of Splash! Right![Players laugh]Ali: Oopsies.Goodrich: I take out the Ira Glass and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Splash, Splash, you still there? You still there, bro?Kyle (as Symbol): You got it right the first time, it’s Symbol.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, right. Okay.Kyle (as Symbol): What’s up? What’s going on? What –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So-Kyle (as Symbol): Nobody said anything. You called me and then I didn’t hear anything other-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [sighs] Jeez.Ali (as Yashee): You heard a “brr”?[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That wasn’t me. Anyway-Kyle: Roll a deception check. I’m joking.Goodrich: It was a four.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, it totally was. Gross.[Players keep laughing]Goodrich: Anyways, can I just tell Splash all that’s happened up to this point?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So we all three then-Spurrier: Regale him.Goodrich: -regale him, and I guess we can also, at the same time, regale the miners with what they missed when they got knocked.Kyle: Knocked out?Goodrich: Yeah. And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So Splash, what do you make of that?Kyle (as Symbol): Uhhhh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Take your time.Kyle (as Symbol): That’s – you’re being careful, right?Goodrich: I mean, as careful as we can be in this crazy freakin’ cave with mind-squid and fish folks and-Kyle (as Symbol: Um, I’d get out of there.Goodrich: But wait, the water’s gone, you know.Ali (as Yashee): We’ve already come so far.Kyle (as Symbol): I would be reluctant not to direct you to leave if – you know, ‘cause I don’t wanna get in trouble again; your safety is important. This doesn’t sound g- – I mean, I can’t make you do anything at this point. My recommendation is get out safely. If you want to try to continue helping out these people, you can, but you gotta think about is your life worth it. I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [nervously] Will you stay on the line with us, just in case?   Kyle (as Symbol): I mean, I can do what I can, but I’m-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What are you doing right now? What are you doing right now, Splash?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, what’s going on up there?Kyle (as Symbol): Chilling in Basom, having a drink.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Spurrier (as Randy): Proof.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): For real?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.[Goodrich sighs]Kyle (as Symbol): Just, you know-Ali (as Yashee): Figured you’d like sneak down after us or something ‘cause you really care about us.Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, no, I had to go back with the-[Overlapping conversation and laughter*]Kyle (as Symbol): No, I had to go back with the Bureaucrats because, again, I was being, you know, Luey Hewis and everything, so...   Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. What’s the word topside? Any-Kyle (as Symbol): They’ve all packed up and headed on. And they’re frustrated, of course, ‘cause they were pretty excited about being able to go down there, but they’re having to regroup and redecide on who’s actually in the jurisdiction of what’s going on down there, which I don’t know if anybody is, from the sound of what you’re telling me. I will say this: If you decide to stay down there and follow through with what you promised these townspeople, I will not sell you out. I will not throw you under the … cart.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You were gonna?Kyle (as Symbol): No. I’m letting you know that I am not going to say, “They didn’t listen to me.” I’m going to say that I advised them; I think they did the right thing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hmmm.Kyle (as Symbol): If I didn’t say “be safe and get out,” I wouldn’t be doing my job. But I want you to be able to overcome these challenges.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Spurrier (as Randy): Right.       Kyle (as Symbol): You know, we’re collecting history. You’re actually being a part of that history at this point.Spurrier (as Randy): Isn’t that the truth.Kyle (as Symbol): So-Ali (as Yashee): We get like an automatic A, too, right?Kyle (as Symbol): Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): Come on.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, seriously.Ali (as Yashee): I know we’re only like a week into the semester, but-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Seems like a pretty big score.Kyle (as Symbol): I know how you three worry about your grades, and don’t worry about it for this one. Believe me, you’re getting – you know how there’s A’s? Well, I do a special one, S. Don’t say what it’s for. I swear to God, if you say that name again …Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I was gonna say, S for Super duper Splash.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, that’s bye.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye. We’ll keep you updated, Splash. Bye. Spurrier (as Randy): Thanks for your recommendations.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Love you!Kyle (as Symbol): [pauses] I love you too.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aww, he said it! Well-Ali (as Yashee): We’re not gonna listen to him, right?Spurrier (as Randy): No, no.Ali (as Yashee): Just making sure.Kyle: Erin sits up and she’s looking at you three very oddly. She says-Kyle (as Erin): So that – that thing didn’t do anything to y’all, did it? Y’all didn’t – y’all don’t seem like … like us. Uh, we got dropped like a sack of rocks.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Now, it tried that striz on us, but, you know, we were [scoffs] fine.Spurrier: and our necks glowed, right, when that happened?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: They, like, glowed again? I’m just making sure.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Are they still-Kyle: No.Spurrier: -glowing? Okay.Goodrich: I check your back, just-Spurrier (as Randy): Thanks.Goodrich: It’s fine, I guess.Kyle: The scar looks a little bit bigger than it was before.Goodrich: Oh boy.Kyle: But it doesn’t look like – it just looks a little bit bigger. That’s it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s a little bit bigger-Goodrich: I tell you.Spurrier (as Randy): Great.Goodrich: And I poke it, just like we do. [Ali giggles] okay. Well, you said that the footsteps are coming from the right, so…Spurrier: Yeah, we haven’t been off to the right.Kyle: Nope, not yet.Goodrich: You wanna check out – we heard some footsteps, miner crew.Spurrier: Yeah. Miners, do you guys feel like you can get up? Do you need to rest? Like, do you need to  leave? Like, where are you guys at?Ali (as Yashee): We’re gonna keep going in trying to fix this and find out what’s going on here, so...Spurrier (as Randy): But if you guys are gonna be susceptible to this, I don’t know, it’s kind of worrisome.Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I mean, we’re just desert town miners, so, uh – I mean, but you three are obviously much more than that, which-[Goodrich laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): We’re Chaos Sauce.Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, but I mean-Kyle: -and Erin darts a quick look over to Boom Queen, and Boom Queen kinda chimes in, says-Kyle (as Boom Queen): So, uh, who y‘all really with? Y’all secret government projects? You one of them voodoo creations by one of them gold wizards from Arcanium University or something? What’s up with y’all?Spurrier: Whoa, totally.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Oh, okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, we’re not.Spurrier (as Randy): No, no. It would be so cool though. Sorry. I got caught up in the moment.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Boom Queen): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re from Strumlotts. We just-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, we got waitlisted for that other school.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Whatever that was.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Okay. I’m just – you know. Seems like Erin had a lot of stock in y’all, and we took her word for it, but you’re not like any other bards we’ve met from Strumlotts.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you meet a lot of bards from Strumlotts?Kyle (as Boom Queen): No, but, you know. Come through every once in a while. Again, desert town, not that many people want to come out; plus, we don’t really like them outsiders anyway. So, just …Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hopefully you’ll think twice now. We’re from outside of Basom.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Yeah, you know, this – it could be a pivotal moment in our town’s culture and decision on how we treat people, so how this ends may very much affect what happens in the future of our lives.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No pressure.Spurrier: Oh man.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So what’s the verdict? You guys wanna – I mean, we’re not gonna-Kyle (as Boom Queen): We still wanna figure out where the problem with the water’s gone. If y’all are able to clear the way, we might actually be able to do something about that. But, heh heh, I can tell you right now, we – we ain’t going anywhere near that one again.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That one what?Spurrier (as Randy): That squid?Kyle (as Boom Queen): Whatever that Squiddy boy is.[Goodrich and Spurrier make sounds of agreement]Kyle (as Boom Queen): Squiddy thing, whatever. The Alien.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s a good call.Spurrier: And Kyle, the water was coming from the doorway that is closed?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: It’s not coming from the right. Okay.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: So I turn to the miners-Spurrier (as Randy): So do you guys wanna stay here and keep an eye on the water, like in case the door opens, and we can kinda figure out what’s up?Kyle (as Boom Queen): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): ‘Cause you guys don’t seem like you’re in amazing shape.Kyle (as Boom Queen): No, and especially not this naked boy on the ground here. So we might-Spurrier: Uh-oh.Kyle (as Boom Queen): -might keep an eye on him as well.Spurrier (as Randy): That would be-Ali (as Yashee): That’s right.Spurrier: ‘Cause he’s not dead, as far as we can tell? Okay.Kyle: Doesn’t seem dead.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: Phew.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Plus, you got that help from that – that fishy dead thing. Is it-Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, Zil.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Is Zil dead?Spurrier (as Randy): Undead, I think.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Undead?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Boom Queen): You sure you’re not one of them voodoo creations-Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, that wasn’t – I mean, since we’re all down here and being friends, I ate a gem that has a wizard inside of it, and he did that.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Boom Queen): What the-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, we’ll talk about it later, but, I mean, you know...  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): *Don’t worry about it.Spurrier: We’re getting really kind of bonded now, so... So that was him, that wasn’t me.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Oh, alright.Kyle: Trish gives Erin a very odd look, just like “yeah? Alright?” and Erin turns to you three-Kyle (as Erin): We’re gonna rest up here. Y’all – y’all go on ahead. I mean, if you wanna rest, we can keep some eyes on the ways, just to make sure nothing pops up on us, if you need a little bit.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Erin): I mean, we’ve all been going through this together, so … you need some eyes?Goodrich (as Raz’ul: Sure.Kyle (as Erin): This is just for a moment. We ain’t going anywhere.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): We can take a quick rest.Spurrier (as Randy): A short rest.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s do it.Kyle (as Erin): Haha, that’s pretty funny, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, we’re all kinda – yeah. Aw man.Kyle (as Erin): Yeah. Alright.Spurrier: Well, should we rest?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, that’d be good, because IGet my transforms back-Spurrier: Oh nice.Goodrich: -after a short rest.Spurrier: Yes.Goodrich: Cool!Kyle: You’re welcome.Goodrich: Thanks, Kyle![Players laugh]Kyle: Okay, so you take a short rest. Roll hit dice if you need to.[Dice roll]Spurrier: Alright.Kyle: Or want to. What’d you get?Ali: Two.Kyle: Oh yeah! You wanna use more than one?Ali: I don’t know. I got quite a bit off of the Rock Circle healing so...[Dice roll]Goodrich: Yeah, we hooked you up.Ali: I’ll just – I’ll stick with two.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: And I got a six, which amazingly puts me right back at full health.Goodrich: Hurray!Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Does that take care of you on your short rest?[Players agree]Spurrier: Should be good.Ali: Think we’re good.Kyle: Okay. As the short rest comes to an end, Yashee, your bones are feeling weird!Ali (as Yashee): Oh!Kyle: What’s happening, what’s going on with those bones?Ali: What does that mean?Kyle: They start stretching out and reforming back into your normal-size Yashee.Ali: Oh, has it already been two hours?Kyle: Yeah. [Goodrich snickers] I’m thinking, between walking through the cavern after the Roper, and then getting all the Gil stuff figured out, and then what happened in front of the cave and whatnot, and walking through all this area and getting through it.Spurrier: And then having a rest on top of that.Kyle: And then a rest on top of it.Ali: Oh yeah. Okay.Goodrich: And I definitely made some potpourri for the rest, too, so that takes some time.Ali: So I’ll get up and stretch, and I guess I just keep stretching.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yes.Ali: Like-Ali (as Yashee): Wait a second.Ali: My voice goes-Ali: I’m so [voice deepens] – oh, I’m back!Goodrich [as Raz’ul]: That was awesome.Ali (as Yashee): Whoa!Spurrier [as Randy]: Nicely done.Ali (as Yashee): That’s the best stretch I’ve ever had!Goodrich: Yeah, for real!Kyle: Miners are just laughing, just like-Kyle (as miners): [Giggle] You three really are weird.[Players laugh]Ali (as Yashee) Thanks!Goodrich [as Raz’ul): (laughing) thanks! [voice goes up and down] Yeah, weird, uh puberty![Players keep laughing]Kyle: Alright. So that finishes out the short rest. We got regular-size Yashee now. Everyone’s feeling good, ready to go forward. What do?Goodrich: Oh yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right? The room to the right? Go-Ali (as Yashee): Let’s go that way.Goodrich: We heard the footsteps and we’re like “yeah, they’ll be fine.” Took a rest, “Alright, let’s go see if those footsteps are still happening.”Ali: Somebody went down that way.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: You enter a large circular room. There are holes in the ceiling – there’s about four holes in the ceiling. But the main thing that catches your attention is that there are two lines of Gils.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: And all of them are holding a slate, and each has a letter written in Elvish script on it. Raz’ul, you’re able to read this, and you can see that on the left side, it spells out “dummy,” D-U-M-M-Y.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: The right side spells out “Voyeur,” V-O-Y-E-U-R.Goodrich: ‘Kay. I let you guys know that-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): My Elvish is a little rusty, but looks like they’re spelling out “Dummy” on the left and “Voyeur?” on the right, which is weird, but...  Hey Gils. What’s up with your signs? You practicing for the school play or something? What is this?Kyle: You’re talking to them, and none of them respond. They all just stand there, looking mindlessly – kinda their eyes are moving independently of each other-Goodrich: Oh boy.Kyle: -in weird ways, and they’re just standing there holding this.Spurrier: Zil is with us, right?Kyle: Yeah, Zil is with you. Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, you wanna go up and poke one of them, please?Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Just go kick one.Kyle: Zil takes his own arm and walks over and pokes one of the other Gils with it.Spurrier: Nothing happens?Kyle: No reaction.Spurrier: Huh.Ali: Alrighty.Goodrich: Is there anything else in here, Kyle?Kyle: Yeah. You – after you see these Gils that are lined up, you see that there is a doorway to the left, kinda slants down a little bit, and you can actually hear that waterfall sound that you heard in the last room, which came through the door that Squid made his egress through.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: But other than that, there is a door across the way, which has a slight incline to it, but you could go through it if you want to.Spurrier: So is the water one by the ""Dummy"" or by the “Voyeur” or…Kyle: “Dummy” is on the left, so it’s to the left. Yes.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: Ooh.Spurrier: And then the other one’s in between the two words, the one that’s going up?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Okay. So as long as Zil is over there by them, I’m just gonna have-Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, can you pull one of those slates off, see if-Kyle (as Zil): [grunts][Players laugh]Kyle: Zil grabs one of the slates with its single hand, tries to pull on it, but is unable to free the slate from the Gil that’s holding it.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Gil, let me give you a hand over there.Goodrich: I go over, try to help Gil out.Kyle: Give me a strength check.Goodrich: Okay. [Rolls dice] Ooh, sixteen plus three plus one for Jack of All Trades.Kyle: Okay. That’s a soft twenty.Goodrich: Yay! [Yeah! Sound effect] Oh!Spurrier: Just a little one.Goodrich: Ha!Kyle: Okay. So you have this slate in your hand.Goodrich: Which one did I grab? I guess-Kyle: Which one did you grab?Goodrich: Which one was Zil grabbing?Spurrier: That was up to Zil. I just told him to grab one.Kyle: He grabbed the first letter.Spurrier: The D of “Dummy”?Kyle: The D – what would be the D of “Dummy.”Goodrich: So I hold it up, I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Look. This is a D in Elvish. We’re learning.Spurrier: And does the Gil do anything when it’s been taken?Kyle: Just stands there like it’s still holding a slate.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hmm.Ali (as Yashee): Try breaking it. Smash it.Goodrich: I break it over my knee.Kyle: It breaks.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Ali: Did anything happen?Kyle: Nothing happens.Goodrich: Okay.Ali: We already started smashing things.Kyle: Now it just says “ummy Voyeur.”Goodrich: Okay, I just leave it there.Ali (as Yashee): Uh, could this be like a rearrange-the-letters kind of thing? You just messed it up.Spurrier: That’s what I was thinking at first. [Players laugh]Ali (as Yashee): Anybody got any glue?Ali: Does Zil have any like zombie goo coming off of him that we could use as an adhesive?Goodrich: Kyle, is there any goo?Ali: A stony adhesive?Kyle: Who wants to give me a nature check?[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Oh, I will. Druid time! [Rolls dice] Fourteen plus one.Kyle: You, in the past, have come across certain fish that have organs that may produce some kind of adhesive. You wanna try?Goodrich: Okay. Yeah, I’ll just stick it on Gil’s leg.Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, can you ooze a bit for us?Kyle: Uh-Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts quizzically)Kyle: And Zil takes a spear that it still had and kind of – [Players wince] – cuts into himself a little bit.Ali: Oh no!Kyle: and squeezes, and you see this little goo come out - and takes his hand and holds it out to your face.Spurrier (as Randy): Most appreciated. Put it over there, please.Spurrier: And I point at the – well, I point at you, Raz’ul.Goodrich: I put it back together and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Huuh, thanks, Gil.Kyle: You put it back together on the ground, and Zil wipes his hand over it as you hold it in place. And-Goodrich: It looks like Wilson now, and I make a little face on it.[Chuckles]Kyle: It’s the back side, so-Goodrich: Wilson!Spurrier: Zil is handy.Goodrich: Yeah. I put it back in the Gil’s hand and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): My bad.Kyle: Okay. It’s holding it.Goodrich: Sweet.Ali (as Yashee): Alright. Well, shall we head towards the water then?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, yeah. Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. Well, hang on.Spurrier: And I turn toward Zil.Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Spurrier (as Randy): Zil? I appreciate the glue, but I have one more favor to ask. Can you get down on one knee?Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Chuckles] Oh, is this it? The moment?Spurrier (as Randy): It is.[Players laugh]Spurrier: And I hop on Zil.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Tally ho. I’m tired of walking.Kyle (as Zil): [Grumbles]Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you, Zil.Goodrich: Okay. I guess your little feet are getting all wet.Spurrier: Yeah, exactly. Goodrich: All the water. Getting a little chill.Spurrier: Don’t want it to get all gross, all that hair.Ali: (Snorts) Get a little fungus, you don’t need that.Spurrier: Right. [Chuckles]Kyle: Right on. Okay. So you’re heading in the direction of the waterfall.Spurrier: Yes.Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: Cool. So you’re heading toward the sound of where the water is coming from, and as you get closer, it gets louder. And you enter this large onion-shaped room.Goodrich: Do we start crying?Ali: The waterfall’s actually tears?Kyle: Roll a constitution check to see if you start crying from this onion-shaped, yet not onion-stinky, room.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Or if it’s just a beautiful waterfall.Kyle: It’s so gorgeous, you’re moved.Ali: I got a sixteen. Definitely crying.Kyle: Okay. So you wanna-Goodrich: You wanted to cry?Ali: Oh, I thought that’s what we were going for is – are we crying? Can we?Spurrier: We’re just moved.Ali: No? Okay.Kyle: You can cry if you want to. I mean, if you’re trying to stifle tears then, you know-Goodrich: You know what? I’m just gonna cry too. It’s been a long time and I’m just tired. I’m just ready to see something nice.Ali: Just need to let it out.Kyle: You just took a short rest.Ali: I miss being little.Spurrier: I’m gonna let Zil do the weeping for me.Goodrich: Do you tell him “Zil”-weepSpurrier (as Randy): Zil, please weep now.Kyle (as Zil): [grunts]Goodrich: [Laughing] I grab Zil and I-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I know, bud. It’s so-Ali: It’s like goo tears, like the thing out of his-Goodrich: Oh, that’s what we need…Spurrier: That’s what we can do. I need to bottle that up and sell it later.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: I have something to put them in, if you want.Kyle: So you’re collecting Zil tears.Goodrich: And I’m just crying while I do it.Kyle: Okay. So water is pouring from the ceiling and from faces.Goodrich: [Quietly] Yay.Kyle: You notice where the water is pouring from on the ceiling. It actually looks like somebody’s broken the upper part of this curved wall of this room to cause this waterfall to happen, and it’s pouring down into a porthole that kinda sticks up out of the floor. But the waterfall is a little off-center, so some of it goes in the porthole, some of it’s pouring onto the floor, which – this room’s actually built up about six inches of water in it, so we’re calling this, technically, difficult terrain. So it’s gonna be a little bit harder to move – you’ve got half movement – and if anything comes up, keep that in mind. But-Ali: For six inches of water?Kyle: Yeah, for some of you, that’s a lot. That’s a, you know-Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Is it rough terrain for me?Kyle: It might be soon enough. I’ll make an exception to the taller-Ali: Well, I just wanted to check. More puddle – puddle size for Yashee, but-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Randy and I are getting a little worried.Ali: Maybe that’s why I’m crying.Kyle: Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): This used to be hard.[Players laugh]Kyle: So other than the waterfall and the porthole, you notice, near the waterfall, on the ceiling, you notice that there’s a hole that leads up. You also notice that there are a number of large rocks that are on the ground that you can pretty much guess are from the hole in the ceiling where the waterfall is coming from. Other than the hole in the ceiling and other than the entrance you came in, there is an entrance across the way which leads up. To the left, you notice that there’s a door that is closed, which you assume to be the door that Squid closed when they backed out of the transformation chamber rooms.Goodrich: Okay. So that would just go back to the room we all started in?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Where the miners still are? Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Okay. Gotcha.Kyle: Also in this room, you see a large glass dome that’s lined with swirling, dark metal. The glass is thick and has a green hue to it, kinda like, you know, old soda bottles and everything. But the dome is about fifteen foot tall, and if you were to see all the way around it, you’d see fifteen feet around. And there’s a bunch of liquid inside of it, but there’s nothing else in there.Ali: I’d like to investigate that a little bit.Goodrich: Me too.Kyle: Okay, go and roll me some investigations.[Multiple dice rolls]Ali: Well, I got an eight.Kyle: Okay.[Oh yeah! Sound effect]Goodrich: Ohoh!Kyle: Oh man!Spurrier: Plus one.Ali: Yay!Goodrich: I got a five plus one, six.Kyle: Cool. Raz’ul and Yashee, you’re just looking at it like – you know, you’ve got your hands cupped over your eyes like you’re looking into a fish tank, like “weird, weird stuff.”Goodrich: We’re still crying, too.Ali: Just can’t get through it.Kyle: It’s hard to see through the tears.Goodrich: Can’t get it together, yeah.Ali: Dad always said don’t go chasing waterfalls.[Players laugh]Kyle: Randy, as you’re investigating this large dome, you notice, at the bottom, there – it looks like there’s a door. There’s a weird door that-Spurrier: Built into this metal bowl thing?Kyle: Yeah, built into the floor of this metal bowl. It’s a big door.Spurrier: Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, guys, there’s a door.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh boy, another freakin’ door.Spurrier (as Randy): Just our strength.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Where? I don’t see it. I don’t see a door.Spurrier (as Randy): No, here on the – here on the bottom.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, point.Kyle (as Zil): [groans]Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you.Kyle: Zil points to the bottom.Ali (as Yashee): Ohhh! Oh, I see it now. I see it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ohh.Spurrier (as Randy): Well-Ali (as Yashee): Too bad there’s this dome surrounding it. Can’t really get in there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul)?: Hmmm.Kyle: So as you’re investigating this door, you actually start to hear, like, pounding on the door that’s closed, behind you – or the door that was to the left when you walked in. But you can hear this pounding, and you can hear the miners going-Kyle (as miners): [weakly] Hey! Hey! Kyle: You just hear – it’s very faint, and you can almost hear them better coming from around the way you came. And you just hear fish people.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Back to the miners.Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, charge!Kyle: Zil slumps off through the water-Kyle (as Zil): [groans]Kyle: -back the way you came. Are you all going?Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Yeah, we probably should.Spurrier: Yeah, let’s go.Kyle: Okay. So you all begin dashing your way back to the miners. You go through the room that you had just come from. All of those Gils are still standing there, holding their slate – the one being glued. And you come back into the room with the miners, and you notice there’s another line of Gils that are standing there with different slates. And the miners are all cornered off against the closed door. Erin just says-Kyle (as Erin): They just climbed up the way we came, and they just started standing. We thought they were gonna attack us, kill us or something, but they’re just standing there with these – with these slates.Goodrich: What do the slates say? Can I see?Kyle: Yeah. It’s written in Elvin again, and you notice on these, all the slates combined spell out ""BREADCRUMB CRIES.""Goodrich: Oh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It says “BREADCRUMB CRIES,” I think. Again, little rusty, but I’m pretty sure that’s what it says.  Spurrier (as Randy): Hmmm, okay?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So “BREADCRUMB CRIES,” plus “VOYEUR” and “DUMMY.”Ali (as Yashee): Well, we were crying back in the other room.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-oh. Do we do things and then the Gils show up and make fun of us for it?Kyle: [Chuckles menacingly] I don’t know.Goodrich: Oh.[Players chuckle]Kyle: Erin’s just like-Kyle (as Erin): They came from the way we came. They came from down in that room where that one Gil was kinda cut up and everything. Spurrier (as Randy): He was, uh, efisherated.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, that’s right, Randy. Efisherated. That’s real good.Spurrier (as Randy): Aww, thanks.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, we actually found something interesting in the other room, if you wanna come check it out. Are you guys feeling up to it or-Kyle (as Erin): I mean, better than getting surprised by these fishy things again.Spurrier (as Randy): You guys are feeling better?Kyle (as Erin): I mean, it’s only been like a couple minutes since you left.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, you know, but you guys are toughKyle (as Erin): Well, we didn’t think anything would wind up springing up on us like this, and we thought we’d have better … yeah, we’ll go with you.Ali (as Yashee): Alright.Kyle (as Erin): See what you found.[Players snicker]Goodrich: So we go back and show them the room with the big dome and the water and-Spurrier: -and the hole and stuff.Goodrich: -and the sultan-shaped ceiling.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Yeah. ‘Kay.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Here it is. What do you guys make of this?Kyle: They’re standing in the water that’s built up in this room, and Erin’s looking up at it. And she just goes-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I see what your problem is right here. [Players laugh] This – this has gotta be it. I don’t – I mean, we found our direction-Kyle: And she turns to Boom Queen, and Boom Queen kinda looks at her like-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Ah, well, yeah. It’s gonna be a tough one. Um, have y’all checked out that hole in the ceiling? Maybe that leads over … we can do some controlled blasts or something.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, we haven’t quite gotten up there yet.Kyle (as Boom Queen): Oh, well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are you guys wanting to stay here and fix this hole? I mean-Kyle (as Boom Queen): I mean, this is – this’d be the reason that we’d be here for, you know.Spurrier: I was gonna say, it seems like maybe that’s the reason why the place was dried up, up on the surface.Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I mean, you know, it couldn’t hurt to try. If it’s anything else further down, I don’t know if we can do anything about it, but...Goodrich: Could we grappling hook-Ali and Goodrich: Grappling hook![Players chuckle]Goodrich: Could we do that up there? Is that-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: [Coughing] Oh jeez.Kyle (as Erin): Careful there, Raz’ul. You’ll get some of that waterfall water in your mouth, it probably ain’t taste too good, filtered through all the sediments, you know-Goodrich: Yeah, oh boy.Kyle (as Erin): -to really be drinkable.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, my bad. I was just – yup. Anyhoo.[Players laugh]Goodrich: How far up is it, Kyle? Like, if we were to maybe stand-Kyle: It’s about thirty feet.Goodrich: Okay. But if we were to stand on the dome, would it be like fifteen?Kyle: Fifteen feet.Ali: Fifteen.Goodrich: You think you could-Ali: I could probably toss you up there.Goodrich: -toss Randy and I up there. Ali: I’ve got an acrobatics skills. That’s tossing things.Kyle: Yeah, that would be a strength thing, tossing somebody up.Ali: Alright. Well, whatever. Spurrier: And then it would be us to do an acrobatics to see if we do alright?Ali: Do a couple flips.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Let’s do it.Spurrier: Okay.Ali: Alright. Well – I mean, we’d have to get up on the dome in the first place, so…Kyle: That’s easy. With the metal bracings that are on this dome, it’s fairly easy to get some handholds, footholds. Ali: Oh, perfect. I’ll climb on up there, then.Goodrich: Nice. Okay. Aaand we’re up there.Ali: And I’m gonna toss ya.Kyle: Alright. Strength check, acrobatics check.Ali: Alright. [Rolls dice] That is a fourteen plus three.Goodrich: Alright. [Multiple dice rolls] I got a seventeen plus one.Spurrier: I got a two plus nine.[Players scoff.]Ali: Oh god.Kyle: Okay. Yashee, you throw both Raz’ul and Randy up into this porthole-Goodrich: At the same time?Kyle: At the same time.Ali: Sweet.Goodrich: Can we hold hands as we go up?Spurrier: I mean, you already are. Goodrich: Put them up like we’re superheroes like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yay!Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah! Kyle: Raz’ul, you are somehow tossed up a little bit higher than Randy – maybe Randy’s foot was a little slippery from the water –Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No!Kyle: But you’re still holding hands with Randy. So you get one hand up onto the actual edge of this hole, but then you’re cliffhanger-style holding onto Randy. Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: And you’re-Goodrich: Strength check?Kyle: Yeah, you’re gonna need a strength check to be able to pull yourself up.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Groans with exertion]Spurrier (as Randy): You got this!Goodrich: Almost got it![Dice roll]Ali (as Yashee): Climb up him! Climb right up him!Goodrich: Alright. Got a fifteen plus three plus one.Kyle: Okay. Yeah, you manage to pull yourself up. Like, what you do is you kinda use the momentum of pulling yourself a little bit to swing Randy up.Spurrier (as Randy): [very deadpan] Wheeee!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [groaning with exertion]Spurrier: Extreme!Goodrich: How’s Wimpy. Do I make Wimpy proud? Does he say [in growly voice] “yeah!”Kyle: Yeah. [Players laugh] Yeah. You look down, and Wimpy’s just cross-armed, nodding.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes.Goodrich: And I pull myself up, Simba style, land on Randy’s chest.[Players laugh]Spurrier: Ha, nice. Rude.Goodrich: Murderer!Kyle: Yeah.Kyle: So you pull yourself up into this room, and Randy, Raz’ul, you’re standing in there, and the first thing you notice is there is a coil of rope near this hole that’s tied off to one of the pieces of furniture that’s in here. But other than that, you notice that it’s a long, curved room; kinda looks like it matches the curve of the room that’s underneath you now. And you can hear water rushing from the very far end, and you notice that there’s just three Gils standing in this room. One is facing the wall that you can hear water rushing around, and the other two are just facing each other on each side of this room. Other items you notice in here: there are different tools and stuff set out on countertops; there’s a chair that looks like it’s meant for pedicures, but for some reason there needs to be – for some reason the wrists need to be tied down-Goodrich: Right.Ali: Oh god.Kyle: Who knows. I don’t know. But yeah, that’s what you see in this room. Looks more or less like a miniature salon, if you want to think about it that way, but deadlier.Goodrich: Right. And the two Gils, they’re not, like, chatting about their hairstyles or whatever? They’re just-Kyle: No, no. They’re talking about the new fin style … no.Goodrich: Oh, but they’re interacting?Kyle: No, they’re not interacting. “Where’d you get your fins done?”Ali: “Here. My hands are strapped in.”[Players laugh]Goodrich: What is the piece of furniture that the rope’s tied to?Kyle: It looks like a chest of sorts that has different compartments you can pull out. Imagine like a Craftsman tool chest, different layers and stuff, but not on wheels.Goodrich: If we were to, like, let it down to get Yashee up, maybe helped?Kyle: Yeah, you can actually look at – you can see like, oh, this is definitely here for people to be able to climb down and climb up. It’s probably how these Gils got up here.Goodrich: Oh, sweet.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, well, do we want to get Yashee up here? I mean, we got some rope and stuff.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-Ali (as Yashee): Yes, please.Spurrier: And Kyle, what is Zil doing in the midst of all this?Kyle: Zil is trying to follow you-Goodrich: Aww![Players laugh]Kyle: -but with one arm-Spurrier: Oh, right.Kyle: -is not really able to climb.Goodrich: He’s just running into the dome over and over like [grunts].Kyle: Yeah, just kind of one arm scraping up the dome, but isn’t getting anywhere with it.Ali: Aww, buddy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Tell him to chill.Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, you listen to those miner fellers. If they ask you to do something, you be a good boy and do it now, okay?Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Spurrier (as Randy): Alright. Thank you, Zil. [Players laugh] Alright, you guys have got Zil. You keep an eye on him.Kyle (as Erin): Alright, thanks.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh yeah.Kyle: You hear Boom Queen-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Y’all let me know what you hear up there. Maybe I’ll skitter up there and check it out once you come back.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): ‘Kay.Goodrich: Can we let the rope down to Yashee then? Kyle: Yeah. You let the rope down; Yashee, you climb the rope. It’s super easy.Spurrier: Bam!Kyle: You three are up in this area. What do?Goodrich: I guess walk closer to the Gils, right? Maybe – I mean, all the other ones have been unresponsive. So I walk up and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Gils. We’re [takes a deep breath] here. Here we are.Kyle: Yeah, you walk further into this room-Goodrich: [singing] Here we are now. [Speaking] No, that’s-[players laugh]Kyle: So yeah. You walk further into this room, and the Gils are still unresponsive to your approach. But as you walk further in, Raz’ul, you hear a familiar voice behind you, and it sounds like your father’s voice, saying-Goodrich: Oh jeez.Kyle (as Daz’ul): Ah, my li’l raspberry.[players laugh]Goodrich: What?Kyle (as Daz’ul): How have you been?Goodrich: Did we talk about this, Kyle? [Laughter] I don’t say anything back. Can they hear it?Spurrier: Can we all hear it, or is it in his mind?Kyle: No, it’s just Raz’ul.Goodrich: I … I, straight, keep walking.Kyle: Just don’t acknowledge it?Goodrich: Yup.Kyle: Okay. Alright.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe we should go check with the miners, see if they want to do anything here or what they think.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, see if they might have any ideas as far as what the heck-Spurrier (as Randy): All the water flowing that we’re hearing, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s head on back.Kyle: Cool. So you turn to start walking out, and all of a sudden, you each are struck by a spear from one of these Gils as they just, all of a sudden, emerge to react.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [startled sound][Dice roll]Kyle: And you each take – I’ll just do it all for you – you’ll each take seven damage as these Gils attack.Goodrich: Ooh!Spurrier (as Randy): Run away!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Run away! Keep running!Spurrier (as Randy): Go, go, go!Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: Plus, we told Gil we wouldn’t hurt any other Gils, so…Spurrier: Ehh.Kyle: That’s a good call, that’s a good call.Goodrich: Ha, freakin’ Randy.Kyle: So you run away instead of invoking initiative, and [rolls dice] they’ll each get a – well, hey, they all miss on that one. So you’re just like “ah!” and start running.Goodrich: Jump through the hole.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cannonball!Goodrich: No, Kyle, don’t do it! No, I’m just kidding!Kyle: Okay. Are you sure you wanna do it? Do you cannonball out?Goodrich: No. Uh-Spurrier: We can go down the rope.Goodrich: Oh yeah, there’s the rope.Kyle: Yeah, there ya go. Yeah.Spurrier: Ropes. Slide down the rope.Ali: I forgot about the rope. I’m just gonna jump down the hole.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: Okay. Are you going to try to – where are you gonna try to land?Ali: Probably on that dome.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Let’s just try to swing down the rope like DuckTales.Ali: Ohhh, you guys have fun with that.Kyle: She says she’s jumping.Goodrich: [Sadly] Oh.Kyle: So … alright. So you two, give me an acrobatics roll real quick, just to make sure, see how well you use this rope.[Multiple dice rolls]Spurrier: That is an eighteen plus nine.Goodrich: And a twelve plus one.Kyle: Okay. You’re both good.Goodrich: We DuckTales down the rope.Kyle: You jump out and-Ali: I’m all like “woohoo!”Goodrich: No, we’re like “woo hoo.” You’re not like “woohoo.”Ali: I jump right down. I’m excited!Goodrich: Whatever.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yashee, you jump out of this hole after your two compatriots have spun their way down the rope that’s hanging from-Ali: Halfway down in jumping, I’m like “oh, yeah, the rope.”[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: As you see us, we’re just like,Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What are you doing?Spurrier (as Randy): Bye.Kyle: And you land on the dome and your heels hurt a little bit. You take like three points of damage. It’s not that bad but-Goodrich: Did she crack it at all, maybe?Kyle: No, it did not crack. I would have said it if it did.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Spurrier: Tough. Tough stuff.Kyle: Mm-hmm. So you’re standing there and you look up, and you just see those three Gils looking down at you, and they’re just blinking one eye at a time – [Goodrich and Spurrier giggle] – which people would call winking, I guess, but-Ali: I’m gonna take out my bag with the finger in it and just like wave the bag at them.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, that’s right.Goodrich: Yeah, since we missed our opportunity with Squid.Kyle: One of them throws its spear at you. [Rolls dice]Ali: [laughing] Oh god.Kyle: And it misses.[Players laugh]Kyle: And breaks on the glass.Goodrich: Did it crack then?Kyle: [indignantly] No!Spurrier: It’s potent.Ali: I did have my Thundertap shoes on. That didn’t help? Little surge?Kyle: You weren’t tapping out a beat when you landed.Ali: Okay. Well-Kyle: Yeah, hmm. They’re just standing there, looking down at you. They don’t look mad or happy. They just look – like Gils.Goodrich: Like Gils.[Players giggle]Kyle: And you hear Boom Queen say:Kyle (as Boom Queen): Hey, y’all find anything interesting up there? What’s up with them?Ali (as Yashee): They stabbed us.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): It was very uncool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Also, there’s nothing up there. There’s – we could hear the water, but it looked like some sort of-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Wait. You heard the water? What?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, we got up there and we heard the water flowing from, you know, the other side. It’s going around, and we heard it flowing past, and it sounds like maybe we just got a leak in the pipe that’s flowing around.  So maybe-Kyle (as Boom Queen): Okay. Well yeah, if I can – I bet if I could get up in that room, maybe I could do a controlled blast of some sorts, maybe knock that wall down, fix – you know, get a little patch, you know.Kyle: And you hear Erin chime in.Kyle (as Erin): Well, actually, Boom Queen, that’s a good idea, but man, it’d be much easier to work from the inside of that pipe if it’s possible, but I don’t know if anyone can swim up in water like that. Maybe one of these fishy people, but…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You got a freakin’ Zora.Kyle (as Erin): Nah – what’s that?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nope, never mind.Kyle (as Erin): Alright. Um, anyway, yeah. If we could get up in there and that might be easier overall.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Well, we could probably stop the water magically.Ali (as Yashee): We could try.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. I mean, would that help, if the water was temporarily stopped?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, you guys could go up in there and-Spurrier (as Randy): I don’t know how long we could give you, but some would be better than none, I would think.Kyle: Erin goes like-Kyle (as Erin): [tentatively] Yeah, if y’all can do that, that’d be-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Deh, ‘cause the water’s definitely flowing around that room, so it sounds like we just need to do something about that hole. Maybe we should’ve started with that.Spurrier (as Randy): Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re just exploring!Spurrier (as Randy): Live and learn, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re bards, not freakin’ spelunkers.Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I mean, that’s why we’re here. I mean-Spurrier (as Randy): Right, exactly.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): This is really all your fault, why it took so long. Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, it’s totally my fault.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, no, I’m just kidding. One, two, three, four!Kyle (as Erin): Alright.Spurrier (as Randy): That’s a little rude.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aww.Kyle: So it sounds like we’re gonna be writing a song.Ali: That sounds like it.Goodrich: Let’s write a dam song.Kyle: Kyle, the dungeon maestro said. [Players laugh] A dam song. I see. [Goodrich imitates rimshot quietly] I hear. Roll the dice.[Music transitions]Ali: So are we doing major or minor?Goodrich: Oh boy. I wanna do what we kinda did that other time, we just flip a coin.Ali: Flip a coin?Spurrier: Oh, okay. Yeah, it’s kind of ...Ali: I’ve got my old coin in here.Spurrier: -plumbing. Are they happy songs or are they sad songs?Ali: Alright.Goodrich: I mean, we could just do major. I dunno. I’m in a major kind of mood.Spurrier: We’re trying to fix the problem, I suppose.Ali: To will the water to hold back, please.Goodrich: Weather’s like nice outside, and spring has finally sprung in Texas.Ali: Well, let’s just do major then.[Players laugh]Spurrier: Alright.Ali: Alright.[Multiple dice rolls]Goodrich: Someone got a wild. I don’t-Spurrier: That was you.Goodrich: Was it? Really?Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: Oh, okay. Here we go. [Rolls dice] Cool. Okay. So C, G, B diminished, and D minor.Kyle: Sweet.Spurrier: Not too shabby.Kyle: [Drawn out] Drrumms.[Coin flip]Ali: Uh-oh. That’s a heads.Goodrich: That’s a heads.Ali: It’s a heads.Goodrich: [like a baseball announcer] It’s a heads. [Dice roll] It’s a twenty-six.Ali: Alright. We got the twenty-six. Rock 10.Goodrich: We been rocking it out lately.Spurrier: Seriously, with all this rock.[Dice roll]Goodrich: [Whispering] Dice, no!Ali: What is that? Sixty-seven. Rock 14.Kyle: Okay. Sweet. Alright. Get to writing.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone. It’s your dungeon maestro Kyle, just joining you again to say thank you for listening, and thanks for, you know, keep hanging out with us and everything. We’re so close! We’re almost back to Strumlotts, or we’re getting to a point where we can go back there.

Fair warning: the – I’ve been listening in on the bards writing their song, and there’s gonna be a good opportunity, parents, for you to teach your children about homonyms, because we use one a lot. It’s – yeah, a lot. It’s the homonym for river barrier blocking thing.[Sound of a ringing phone][Small beep]Goodrich: [from a phone line] Hey Kyle, it’s Goodrich, from the future. It’s late, I’m editing the episode. [Giggles] It’s actually homophone, not homonym. Uh, yeah. Whoops. So anyways, it’s our bad, and go ahead, Kyle. Bring us home, buddy. Bye. [Long beep.]Kyle: So, you know, if you wanna take an opportunity, preview the song beforehand, make sure you’re cool with it for them to listen to, by all means, go right ahead. That way, they’re not running around just repeating this word, because … you know how kids are.Anyway, that’s all I’ve got to say. Of course, they hope you enjoy it, I hope you enjoy what they’ve written. It’s actually a lot of fun. So let’s get to it.[Music transitions]Kyle: Okay. So you begin talking to the miners about being able to magically stop the flow of water. And Raz’ul, as you go to grab your instrument, you notice it begins to flicker, light up – [Goodrich giggles] – glow even. [Goodrich giggles again] And it emits that same familiar magical glow that you’re getting ever so used to.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright.Ali (as Yashee): So warm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey guyyys, let’s dam it up![Guitar chord, followed by drumbeat and singing)(verse 1)Goodrich, Ali and Spurrier: [Singing] Oh, the water flows, give it nowhere else to go, it’s gotta hold, how will it hold?(Chorus, 2x)Ali: I said a dam!Goodrich and Spurrier: [singing] Dam dam dam dam dam dam dam dam.Ali: We’ll make a dam.Goodrich and Spurrier: [singing] Dam dam dam dam dam dam dam dam.(verse 2)Goodrich, Ali, and Spurrier: [Singing] Oh, it starts to slow, the pressure’s getting low, it’s gonna hold.Goodrich and Spurrier: You know that we’re believers even though we ain’t no beavers. [Continue as in  chorus]Ali: I said a dam, dam dam dam dam dam dam, we’ll make a dam, dam dam dam dam de dam, I said a dam, dam dam dam dam dam dam, we’ll make a dam, dam dam dam dam, I said a dam dam dam de dam, I said a dam dam dam, we’re making the dam. Oh, we’ll make a dam, we’ll make a dam, making the dam!Kyle: So Raz’ul, you strum out this D minor add 9 chord, and listeners, we’re taken to seeing Symbol, sitting in the bar with Mary and Tony, and he looks around and says-Kyle (as Symbol): What was that?[Players laugh]Goodrich: “I didn’t teach them that.”Kyle: But no, you begin playing the song together, and magic begins to come out of your instruments and flow around the room. And it intersperses with the water and kinda weaves its way through it. The water slowly begins to stop flowing, and you see your magic basically lifting it and pushing it back into the hole that it’s coming out of. And from there, once it stops flowing, you see your magic just, bam, spread into place and make a magical dam, stopping the water. And at this point, Trish and Erin and Alphonse are all looking at it like-Kyle (as miners): Well, damn!Goodrich: Well, damn![Players laugh]Kyle (as miners): I don’t-Goodrich: Does Zil also say “damn” and he goes [appreciative grunt].Kyle (as Zil): [grunts]Goodrich: He jumped in on the chorus [continues grunts]Kyle (as Zil): [grunts][Players laugh]Kyle: At this point, you hear the slates that the fish were holding in the previous room, those all crash, and you hear a couple of Gils march in. And they stand there, look at you, and they point in the direction that they came from. And Erin looks at you three and she says-Kyle (as Erin): Uh, not really sure what happens, but I think we could definitely work with what you’ve done here. So, I tell you what. That Squid person’s obviously trying to get your attention, you know, with these fish people, but we’ll take care of this here.Kyle: And Wimpy actually is getting some things out of his pack, is like-Kyle (as Wimpy): If there’s one thing my ex Jeff taught me, it’s if someone’s trying to kill you, you gotta kill them first. So…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa.Kyle (as Wimpy): That’s how it is.Spurrier (as Randy): Aw man.Kyle: And Trish is – Trish chimes in, says-Kyle (as Trish): Yeah, ‘cause if we don’t take care of them, this is just gonna happen all over again, right?Ali (as Yashee): I s’pose.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): yeah.Kyle: So Erin comes over, she’s just saying-Kyle (as Erin): So we – I mean, we can take care of this here if you’ll take care of … that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): We can try.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Goodrich: And I turn to you guys and I say – I look up at, you know, what we did, and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Huh, should probably add to our business cards – like at the bottom as our little tagline - “Chaos Sauce, they dam right.”[crickets/Spurrier gives a pity chuckle]Goodrich: Screw you guys. That was good! That is a good tagline for our cards, alright? “They” – never mind.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Erin): Good one, Raz’ul.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Erin): So we’re gonna get to work here-Goodrich: I said all that in character; you guys just looked at me like [Spurrier and Ali giggle] “No, come on, man. We’re workshoppin’Ali (as Yashee): You know, we’ll talk about it when we get back to school, okay?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [disappointed] Alright.Kyle (as Erin): Alright. Well, we’ll take care of this. You think y’all should get on?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, let’s go get that Squid boy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright.Goodrich: I take out my pencil and I’m chewing the eraser, like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aww, I thought that “they dam right” was really good.Ali: Just cross it off your list. Nope.Goodrich: Just cross it off the list. Nope.Kyle: Alright. So are you moving on?Goodrich: Yes.Ali: Onward.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: So you backtrace through several of the rooms that you’ve been in, and each of them has, you know, a small subset of Gils that are pointing the direction you should go.Ali (as Yashee): This is way easier.Kyle: Yeah, I guess.[Players laugh]Ali (as Yashee): Is this what that ""BREADCRUMB” thing meant? Is this a-Kyle: Yeah, yeah. These are the breadcrumb cries.Ali: It was the Gils the whole time.[Players laugh]Kyle: But you eventually make your way back into the room that had the eviscerated Gil in it, and remember there’s that porthole that you didn’t go up through?Ali: Mm-hmm.Goodrich: There’s a lot of things we didn’t do, you have to be more specific.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Through a lot of holes recently.Kyle: So … but there is a rope hanging from that hole, and the Gils are pointing you up into that direction.Goodrich: And those ropes weren’t there before?Kyle: They weren’t there before.Goodrich: Okay. Uh-Ali: Do we need to do a climbing check or anything?Kyle: Nah. It’s rope.Ali: So just head on up.Goodrich: Do we want to go up the ropes, period?Ali: Are they pointing up there?Kyle: Yep, they’re pointing up that direction.Ali (as Yashee): We should probably just go.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s time.Goodrich: Alright. I’m getting pumped up. Magic worked, feeling good.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Excited breath] I’m loose, I’m loose, I’m ready.Kyle: Alright. So you make your way up through the hole, and you come out through this little hallway as it levels out. And you notice this corridor arcs to the right, and there are Gils lined on both sides of it. On the left side of this corridor, you notice that there’s a passage that just goes off into dark cave, and there’s two archways that are set apart about – probably about like five, ten feet or so. On the right side of this corridor, there are three archways that are about five feet apart, and all the Gils that are lining this are pointing into this arched – the archways to your right.Goodrich: So they’re like the Rockettes, kind of? [laughs]Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Like they all have their arms on their shoulders?Kyle: But they’re not pointing with their legs.Goodrich: Right. Or are they, Kyle?Kyle: No, they’re not.Goodrich: Oh.Ali: Do you mean three archways, like three separate ways to go, or like-Kyle: It’s like a series of archways. Like you have one, two, three-Ali: Okay. So one pathway that has three-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Ali: -archways.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Cool.Kyle: So … and they’re pointing to the archways that are on your right.Goodrich: Synchronized.Kyle: Mm-hmm.Goodrich: Like the Rockettes. The Gilettes. I’m just gonna imagine that they are.Kyle: You can imagine whatever you want. That’s the whole name of the game-Goodrich: Alright.Kyle: -is imagining things.Goodrich: I follow. Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You guys gonna follow them, Gils pointing us the way there?Spurrier (as Randy): [sighing] Oh yeah.Ali: Let’s keep it going.Kyle: Okay. So you enter this area, and you see Squid standing near what looks like to be a large pink mound that is resting in a large pool of briny-looking brackish kind of water. Standing between you and them are about six Gils: some of them are wielding spears, some have staves, and a couple of them have these weapons that look like the gopher reach-and-grab sticks, but instead of rubbery material, it’s like sharp teeth.Goodrich: Right.Spurrier: Uh-huh.Kyle: So the Gils are looking mindlessly at you, and Squid notices you walk in.Goodrich: I nudge Yashee-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [whispering] Get that finger ready.[Players laugh]Ali: I pull it out slowly. [imitates cartoon noise]Kyle: And you hear Squid say-Kyle (as Squid): Ah, we can finally end this. But let me ask-Kyle: And Squid’s interrupted at this moment. You hear the voice that you heard earlier, that beckoned Squid away.Kyle (as other voice): [with low-pitched echo] No, no more questions! They should be in ceremorphosis by now! Failure is not tolerated, and you have failed!It was a mistake to change you, but there were no other options. Witness the true power of the illithid!Kyle: And this pink mound that’s floating in this brine rises up and begins to float above the pool, and it looks like a big mound of pink ground meat, or-Ali (as Yashee): There it is! It’s back! The meat of my dreams.Goodrich: Oh no! Yashee’s smitten.[Players laugh]Kyle: Raz’ul, you think back to looking through the anatomy book, and you can tell that this is a large brain.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, it’s a large brain. It’s a large brain!Spurrier (as Randy): Ugh.Kyle: So-Goodrich: What’s Zil doing? What’s he doing.Kyle (as Zil): [grunts]Goodrich: Is he freaking out?Kyle: Zil’s just standing there. He’s still a zombie.Goodrich: Oh, he’s not like wide-eyed and-Kyle: No reaction.Goodrich: He sees the big brain!Ali: Well, I mean, like, zombies eating brains.Kyle: Oh.Ali: Like, starting to drool.Kyle: I see. I see, yeah.Goodrich: Still nothing?Ali: Just, no.Kyle: There’s a trickle-Ali: I see and I don’t care.Kyle: Yeah, there’s a trickle of saliva dripping from I guess what would be a fish lip.Ali: Oh thank goodness. Okay.Kyle: So-Ali: Me and him both. [Goodrich laughs]Kyle: And you notice as this brain rises up out of the brine, you notice like these large tentacles – it’s just part of the thing.Goodrich: It’s part of the thing.Kyle: It looks like, you know, Andross at the end of Star Fox 64, so just picture that. There are no eyeballs.Goodrich: I’ve been picturing that this whole time, so thank you.Kyle: Yeah, that’s exactly what it is. And so you hear-Kyle (as other voice): Cera will take care of this.Kyle: And we’ll see what Cera’s gonna do next time.[Theme music fades in]Goodrich: Cera Bellum.Ali: Ah!Kyle: Got it! Got it!Goodrich: Ding ding ding!Ali: There it is.[Theme music finishes]"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-20-cera-bellum,Episode 20 – Cera Bellum,"Episode 20 – Cera Bellum[Theme song plays]Kyle: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to BomBARDed. We are going to be continuing the storyline. So I have Goodrich, Ali, and-Goodrich: Huh?Spurrier: Hi, everybody.(All cheer)Kyle: [singing] Back in the saddle again.Goodrich: So who is it that you play? It’s like Ralphie? Rinaldo?Spurrier: Randall, I believe it is.Kyle: Ralphie!Goodrich: No, it’s just Randy.Spurrier: Just little ol’ Randy.Goodrich: Just Randy.Kyle: We’re excited to have Randy back. Let’s go ahead and recap Episode 19, since it happened sooo long ago. So the episode started with Squid being called back by a different voice in all of your head, and Squid retreated through the door. The door closed, which kind of stopped the stream that was pouring through the room that you were standing in. So during this time, Raz’ul, you slipped a stealthy call to Symbol and kind of discussed the events that had been happening, stuff that went on since you’ve kind of split. Symbol saying, “Uh, you know, I’d be remiss if I didn’t advise you just leaving, but I don’t fault you either for being bards of your word and following through with what you promised the miners. Just be careful.” So the bards helped the miners onto their feet. But afterwards, you guys decided, after a short rest, to explore the direction that you heard some fishy footsteps coming from. And that’s where you came into that room that had the – you know, the tiles that spelled out “dummy voyeur.” So from there, you decided to check out the room to your left, which had the sound of a waterfall coming from it, and this is where you discovered a larger chamber with a giant glass dome, and what you believe to be the cause of Basom’s oasis problem. So after that, you rushed back to go find the miners, because you heard a commotion coming from the other side of the closed door. And you arrived back to find that more Gils with slates had appeared in the room; that’s what caused the miners to freak out. And that one was the one that spelled out “breadcrumb cries.” So -- and I believe the Discord figured all that out and-Spurrier: Yes.Kyle: -nailed it all down.Spurrier: Deciphered it a lot better than we did.Kyle: Cried about-[Overlapping conversation]Kyle: That’s okay. Listeners-Ali: We spent like ten seconds on it.[Players laugh]Spurrier: We just smashed one of them.Goodrich: Oops!Kyle: And then glued it back together with Gil stuff. So – but if you aren’t aware, you can still figure it out if you don’t know the answer; I’m not going to give it to you.Goodrich: When we did so, did you mark down that we have Zil’s tears bottled? Because that could be valuable. Spurrier: I think I did.Goodrich: Okay. Well, just, you know...Kyle: If you don’t, put it in your inventory. So—but everyone decided to get up out of that room because it was kinda getting creepy, and you bards took the miners back to check out that sweet waterfall and the problem. This led to some rooting around in the ceiling, just to see what was going on up there. You came across some Gils that were chilling up there, which, you know, you guys didn’t have time for that. So you came to a group conclusion that it’d be easier to try to get up into the source of water and do some strategic explosions rather than blowing up a wall in the third ceiling room. You told the miners, “Hey, you know, we can probably control the flow of the water,” and you performed a song which actually slowed the flow of water and kind of dammed things up. [Players chuckle]Kyle: And the miners said, “Well, we can take care of this, but honestly, Squid needs to be taken care of, or this is just going to keep happening.”Goodrich: Man, one song that I heard just this morning on the radio was that Talking Heads song, the Once in a Lifetime, [sings] “Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down, letting the days go by, water flowing underground.”Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: And like, the way that it is with that synth at the beginning [imitates synthesizer] “Picture yourself!” and I was like, “Aah! It’s like I’m back in the cave with Squid!”Ali: It’s getting you like pumped up for the game. Goodrich: Yeah, pretty much.Kyle: Very relevant. But it was after-[All laugh]Kyle: It was after this that you guys were directed by the Gils that had been walking around and doing stuff – they were kind of pointing you in the direction of where to go, and it eventually led you to a large pool chamber area where you encountered Squid, six other Gils, and a large brain.Goodrich: [with a strong Southern accent] Meat! Meat!Kyle: Yeah, a large pile of meat.Ali: Meat boi.Spurrier: Little meat boi.Kyle: And this is where you met Cera. And this is kinda when everything comes to a head, and we’re kind of at that moment, so …Goodrich: Comes to a head? Spurrier: Nice. Goodrich: (murmurs) Cera Bellum…[General groaning]Kyle: So I guess we’re gonna start the episode with rolling some initiative.[Goodrich groans]Spurrier: Oh my.Goodrich: Welcome back, Spurrier!Spurrier: Yeah, I was just going to say.[Multiple dice rolls]Goodrich: And Kyle, what’s Jermaine’s situation?Kyle: You don’t know.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Spurrier: Naked and alone.Goodrich: All by himself in the other room.Spurrier: Just what he wanted.Ali: Right. Well, I got a-Kyle: Yeah, Ali, what’d you get?Ali: Sixteen.Kyle: Randy, what you get?Spurrier: Eighteen plus three.Kyle: Goodrich?Goodrich: I got a fifteen plus nada.Kyle: Alright. And for the purposes of Zil, Randy, you’ll just be able to control Zil on your turn.Spurrier: Okay. Goodrich: Oh, that’s right.Kyle: You let me know what you want him to do. Goodrich: And are you still riding Zil?Spurrier: Uhh, definitely.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Okay.Spurrier: Always and forever.Goodrich: Alright. You’re like a freakin’ jousting match over here.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Now, just to describe what’s going on: again, this is a room with a large pool in it. There is a perimeter around there that you can walk. If you go through the water, it is going to be difficult terrain. The Gils are lined up in front of Cera in a staggered formation, and Squid is off to the left, hovering above the water a little bit next to Cera.Goodrich: So Cera Bellum is the brain meat creature?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay. The voice was a disembodied voice that we don’t know where it’s coming from?Kyle: I mean, yeah. That's Cera though.  Goodrich: So Cera refers to themself in the third person?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Oh!Spurrier: They can do what they want.Goodrich: That’s fair.Spurrier: They’re a giant brain.Goodrich: Well, yeah, I know. It just, you know …Ali: And Squid’s just up there, hanging out like, watching?Kyle: Yeah, just floating nearby.Ali: -- little audience, like watching the scene.Kyle: Yeah.[Ali snickers] Kyle: So we start off-Ali: Rude.[Players giggle]Kyle: Randy is the first one in the initiative order.Goodrich: Oh boy.Spurrier: Does Zil – I mean, is Zil affected by the difficult terrain as well?Kyle: You wouldn’t imagine they are, because they are amphibious, so…Spurrier: Okay, cool.Kyle: No. Why not?Spurrier: Alright.Goodrich: You can ride him like a freakin’ dolphin.Spurrier: I was gonna say.Goodrich: [laughs] Free Willy!Kyle: What’s that Daniel Radcliffe movie?Spurrier: Oh, Swiss-Kyle: Swiss Army ManGoodrich: Swiss Army ManSpurrier: Farting along. Goodrich: Yeah. [Everyone laughs]Spurrier: Oh, Zil ho. I’m gonna keep that in my back pocket. For now though, since this is uncharted territory, I’m just gonna shoot at Cera Bellum with my bow.Kyle: Okay. Go ahead and roll me an attack roll.[Dice roll]Spurrier: Off to a roaring start, that is a two plus six.Kyle: Hey!Goodrich: You’re just getting back into it.Spurrier: Yeah, I was just gonna say.Goodrich: No one can fault you that.Kyle: That is going to miss.Spurrier: Yup.Kyle: So anything with your movement? You gonna stay where you are? Again, you can command Zil to do what you want on your turn, so …Spurrier: I’m just gonna stay safely on Zil for right now.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: That’ll do it.Kyle: Okay. Well, that will take us to – it’ll actually take us to a layer action that Cera is going to take. And Randy, I am gonna need you to give me a charisma saving throw, please.Spurrier: Okay. [Rolls dice] So glad I’m a halfling! That was a one. Let’s reroll that again.Kyle: Okay, go right ahead.Spurrier: I’m gonna try rolling with my other hand.Goodrich: I was gonna say, roll with your non-cast hand.Spurrier: Yeah, let’s try that again. [Rolls dice] Okay, that’s better. That is an eight plus four.[Goodrich giggles]Kyle: Okay. So you fire this bolt off, and then all of a sudden, you feel this sensation just overcome you and you can’t – it’s like you are stuck in place. Like, it’s not like you’re frozen or paralyzed, but it’s just that you can’t move out of the area you’re in.Spurrier: So like my body can move, but I can’t leave the area?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay, cool.Kyle: You’re like stuck in the area that you’re in. So …Goodrich: You’re like Michael Jackson doing the lean he does in the Smooth Criminal video.Spurrier: There we go. Yeah, exactly.Ali: Ah!Kyle: Absolutely. Okay. It is Squid’s turn in the initiative. Squid is going to float over past the Gils and-Ali: Oof.Kyle: -- right up to little Randy and make a tentacle attack. [Dice roll]Goodrich: With his face?Kyle: Yeah. [All laugh] Kyle: Yeah, he’s just gonna go and like whip at you with his tentacles and go [growls].Spurrier: [groans]Kyle: And a sixteen hits you?Spurrier: Just barely.Kyle: Just barely. [Players laugh] Kyle: Squid comes up to you and begins to have their tentacles go all over your face –Spurrier: [groans]Kyle: And you feel it’s very slimy, very uncomfortable.Goodrich: The little suckers stick on?Kyle: Yeah, they stick on there. [Someone makes kissing sounds] Kyle: And you feel that same sensation like you had felt when you got like psychic blasted and everything.Spurrier: Oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: And-Goodrich: This isn’t like Squid giving Randy a kiss, is it? Is this how they kiss?Kyle: No.Spurrier: A mental kiss.Kyle: Yeah, a kiss like you would get from-Goodrich: An octopus?Kyle: -a xenomorph.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So because it makes contact with your face, you are considered grappled, which-[Goodrich laughs] Kyle: -if you want to escape that, you can on your turn when it comes back around. So it …Spurrier: So I’m grappled in addition to not being able to leave the area that I’m in?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: On top of Zil.Spurrier: On top of Zil.Kyle: Yes.Ali: But that also means that Squid is, like, stuck where he is too, right? Because –Kyle: Yeah. I mean, well, Squid could technically – you can drag somebody using half of your movement.Ali: Because he’s got multiple tentacles.Kyle: Well, yeah. They’re using all four to latch on.Ali: Oh, okay. So-Spurrier: Ah.Ali: -no available tentacles.Kyle: No available tentacles. Can only do it to one person at a time.Spurrier: Well, well, well.Kyle: Astute observation. And that is going to end Squid’s turn, which takes us to Yashee.Ali: Oh!Kyle: What do?Ali: And I’m right next to Randy?Kyle: Yes.Ali: Okay. Since Squid is like suction-attached to him, I think I’m gonna take out my maul and just give him a whack. I’ll be like – Ali (as Yashee): Hey, leave him alone! Ali: I’m just gonna try to smack him right on his head, just like a bop! Like, “Get outta here!” Bap!Goodrich: Bad Squid! Bad Squid!Kyle: Then give me an attack roll. And since he’s in a grapple, you would have advantage.Spurrier: Nice![Dice roll] Goodrich: You have advantage. It’s cool, it’s cool.Ali: Oh, okay, cuz that was a two.Kyle: Yeah, go ahead, roll again for me.Ali: Alright, let’s try that one more time. Come on! [Rolls dice] Okay, that is a twelve plus six.Kyle: Okay, that is going to hit.Ali: Alrighty, that’s a 2D6, so let’s see. [Rolls dice] Okay. A six plus one plus my strength is ten.Kyle: Okay. So you go for this attack, and while you do make contact, Squid maneuvers in a way to where you miss his head and you wind up hitting part of the breastplate that they’re wearing. Still do damage, but you miss the head, of course. If you get that critical hit, we’ll talk.Goodrich: [Laughs] Come back and see me.Kyle: Yeah. Anything else in your turn?Ali: Um…how deep is the water?Kyle: Where the Gils are standing looks like it’s probably, you know, three to four feet, but underneath where Cera is looks like it gets significantly deeper.Ali: Ah, okay. I’m just gonna stay where I am for now.Kyle: Okay, excellent. Well, that’s your turn. Raz’ul?Goodrich: Okay! Well, so I see Squid go over and give Randy this disgusting kiss, and I’m going to just react. I’m close by enough, I guess, to just-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: -walk over.Kyle: Yeah, you can do that.Goodrich: Now, I want to just use Usumptin, just to try to chop off Squid’s tentacles-Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: -just so that he can’t do this to Randy or anyone else.Spurrier: Or anyone.Goodrich: So … [Rolls dice] well, five plus six, so eleven for my attack roll.Kyle: Unfortunately, that does not hit. Goodrich: Booo.Kyle: You move around to try to get a swing on Squid, and they seem to maneuver, like take a step forward, pushing Randy back just enough to where, nah, you miss.Goodrich: Maybe Squid’s so gross too, I just get up close, I’m like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aaah, gross!Kyle: “It’s nasty. I don’t actually want my axe to touch it.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, Usumptin, you stay over here.Ali: You don’t use your axe as an axe very often. [All laugh]Ali: Whooooa!Goodrich: It’s just like us doing this. We haven’t done this in forever! [All laugh] So meta. Okay.Kyle: Okay. So that takes us to Cera’s turn in battle. So Cera is gonna take one of those large tendrils and swing it at Raz’ul.Goodrich: It can reach all the way over here?Kyle: Oh yeah, it’s a loooong one.Spurrier: Gross.Kyle: This long one goes right over the Gils and right towards you. [Rolls dice] And-Goodrich: Misses!Kyle: Actually, it does not.Goodrich: Ohhhh!Kyle: It gets you, and you wind up taking twenty bludgeoning damage.Goodrich: Whohohoooa! What?Ali: Oh no!Spurrier: Wow.Kyle: And this large tendril, like, wracks into your side, kinda pushes you forward just slightly, but then wraps around you, and you are considered grappled.   Goodrich: Jeez.Kyle: And it is going to take another action, and it is going to try to do the same thing to Yashee. [Rolls dice] And it is going to hit Yashee as well-Ali: Oh no.Kyle: -for eighteen damage, bludgeoning damage.Spurrier: Oh man. Kyle: And you are grappled as well.Goodrich: Delightful.Kyle: And it’s at this point, as you two are being grappled, that you hear Cera say-Kyle (as Cera Bellum): Squid, you are too weak. You are not able to permeate these minds and do what is necessary for the Illithid. Witness the power!Kyle: And there is this wave that just echoes out from it.Goodrich: Not a water wave but-Kyle: Not a water wave, a psychic wave. Much like what Squid did. And same result: You guys don’t seem affected by it at all, and, you know, your necks light up a little bit, your instruments light up a little bit. And Cera is kind of dumbfounded at this moment, or – if a brain could look dumbfounded.  Goodrich: Right. I was gonna say. We can feel its dumbfoundedness. Kyle: Yeah. You sense it in a way. You’re just like, “What? Nothing happened.”Ali: It’s a little droopy.Kyle: And, yeah. The tentacles actually kind of slacken a little bit, which I am going to say, if you’re going to try to break the grapple on this, you will have advantage-Goodrich: Alright!Kyle: -against it. So … but that brings us to the Gils, which – there are two in the back that are wearing these kind of muddy robes and they have scepters. And they begin what looks like casting a spell. And you see this bright light emit around both Squid and around Cera. And you can tell there’s some kind of – looks like a protection spell of sorts. But those are those two movements. There are two that had those reach-and-go sticks that I was talking about, and they make their way up to Zil, and they actually try to grab – I guess there’s only one arm for Zil. So one grabs one arm, one tries to, I guess, grab their shoulder and-Goodrich: Give him a hug and-[Dice roll]Kyle: Yeah, they get some damage in on Zil-Ali: No!Kyle: -which I’m keeping track of that; you don’t have to worry about that, Spurrier.Spurrier: Oh, okay. Cool.Kyle: And Zil is considered grappled as well.Spurrier: Oh my.Kyle: And two – the other two Gils come up to both Yashee and Raz’ul for an attack – [rolls dice] – since you’re there. First one misses – [rolls dice] -- and those guys don’t do too good. So … but that’s the end of the Gils’ turn and the end of the round, so we’re gonna go back to the top. Randy, you’re being grappled right now. Even though Squid was hit by Yashee, you’re still under the grapple. So …Spurrier: Right.Kyle: You can try to do whatever.Spurrier: Just enjoy being grappled for a while.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Really savor this kiss.[All laugh]Goodrich: You can kiss back.Spurrier: I can [audible tongue waggle].Goodrich: Oh jeez.Spurrier: So what would be my – like, what would I be doing for getting out of this grapple?Kyle: You basically give me a strength or a dexterity check, if you want to use acrobatics to try to wriggle your way out.Spurrier: ooh, let’s do the acrobatics and be all wriggly and stuff. Alright. [Rolls dice] That is a fourteen plus nine.Kyle: Okay, yeah. No, you are able to break the grapple. How would you break the grapple with suction cups being on your face?Spurrier: Well, since I’m savoring the kiss, I – he’s probably not expecting it, so I stick my tongue out and really get around in there.[Players laugh]Ali: Prime him!Spurrier: Freaks him out. So my tongue does most of the acrobatics.[All laugh]Kyle: Okay, okay.Spurrier: And I’m free!Goodrich: “And I’m free!”Spurrier: I’m back, baby.Kyle: You just-Goodrich: Squid’s never been kissed like this before. He’s like “Aaah.”Kyle: It’s so foreign. Yeah, no. Squid makes this revolting sound, is just like-Kyle (as Squid): Aaargh! What are you doing?Goodrich: Do we see this, or is this like their little secret?Kyle: Well, you can’t really see it because there’s like webbing around his face, so you don’t see that happen.Spurrier: It’s a personal moment.Kyle: But yeah, Squid pulls back, and the suction cups like “pop-pop-pop” off your face.Spurrier: Sweet.Kyle: And you’re just standing on top of Zil with your tongue sticking out.Spurrier: Bleh.[Players laugh]Kyle: So…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Randy, what did you do to get out of there? Let us know. How do we do it?Spurrier (as Randy): Expressed myself.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Used the-Spurrier: Well, he probably wouldn’t – it probably wouldn’t work again, because he’s been kissed.Goodrich: Oh, I just meant “he did what?”Spurrier: So because of the thing that Cera Bellum did, what actions am I allowed to do or not allowed to do? I just can’t move, or…Kyle: Yeah, you can’t move.Spurrier: But I could just do anything else?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle: However, breaking a grapple takes your action for the turn, so you still have bonus action, but you can’t move, so…Spurrier: Oh, okay. Well, yeah, since all my bonus actions are about moving, I guess I’ll just chill. So…Kyle: Yeah. Nothing wrong with chillin’.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: Stare back into Squid’s eyes.Spurrier: I was gonna say, look longingly. So…Kyle: Well, what about Zil? What do you want to do with Zil?Spurrier: Oh, right. Is Zil allowed to move? Like, how does that affect – since I’m on top of him? Kyle: You have to command him and find out. You’re not sure.Spurrier: Right. Does Zil have any weapons at this point?Goodrich: You said he had a spear, I think.Kyle: Yeah, he’s got a spear.Spurrier: He still has that?Kyle: Yeah, still.Ali: But his hand’s grappled, right?Kyle: Their hand is grappled.Spurrier: So Zil would have to break free of a grapple too?Kyle: Yes.Spurrier: Well, let’s just go ahead and try it. Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: This has kind of been a grapple-themed party so far.  Kyle: Do you want to roll for Zil?Spurrier: Sure.Kyle: Yeah, go for it.Spurrier: And you’ll just add whatever modifiers? Okay. [Rolls dice)Kyle: I’ll make it appropriate.Spurrier: That is an eight plus something.Ali: Alright!Kyle: Zil is trying to wriggle their arm free, but is unable to get it out of that reach-and-grab stick, and it’s just kind of wiggling around, and the other Gil is holding it on real tight.Spurrier: Ah well.Goodrich: [makes buzzer sound]Kyle: So that’s going to be that.Ali: And while he’s wiggling it, a spear like sticks into … (laughter) Oops!Goodrich: Oopsies!Ali: No, no.[Players laugh]Kyle: Well, unable to break the grapple. But we will go to Squid, who is, again, still kind of disgusted and grossed out with you sticking your tongue in their … mouth?Spurrier: In their general direction.Ali: Yeah.Goodrich: So he rolls at disadvantage now, right? Kyle: No.Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: You don’t know.Goodrich: You don’t know.Kyle (as Squid): That was … that was unpleasant. Um…Kyle: And …Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s he talking about?Spurrier (as Randy): You’re the one who initiated it.Kyle: He notices that Raz’ul is bound up in Cera’s tendrils, be like-Kyle (as Squid): Easier target! Alright! Kyle: -and is going to go for an attack on you – [rolls dice] – ugh – and tries to lunge forward. And the fact that you’re grappled doesn’t seem to matter at all. It just, like, totally misses. Like, the tendril from Cera is wrapping around you, and when they go in to do the face-hug thing, it winds up hitting part of the tendril and it’s just like [grunts]. Alright. So that’s gonna be Squid’s turn. We’re gonna go to Yashee.Ali: Alright. Well, Yashee’s getting pissed.Goodrich: Uh-oh.Kyle: Okay.Ali: You know, seeing her friends getting attacked, even if you did get away. I didn’t like that you had to, you know, use your tongue and-Spurrier: It was fine.Ali: -take that. Yeah, well, Yashee wasn’t happy about it. [Players laugh] Ali: So-Ali (as Yashee): [raging] I’m gonna rage!Kyle: So bonus action to rage?Ali: Yeah. So I’m going to rage and try to get out of this grapple. I have an advantage on strength checks.Kyle: Alright. So you can go ahead and roll that strength check at advantage.Ali: Alright.Goodrich: Does she have like double advantage because of – Kyle: No, you can’t do that.Goodrich: Oh, okay.Kyle: Yeah, it’s unfortunate. I wish there was a way, yeah. Stack an advantage.[Dice roll]Goodrich: [in announcer voice] Tr-tr-triple advantage!Ali: Got a seventeen plus three, Kyle.Kyle: Okay.Ali: But, you know what? I mean, I do have advantage. Let me just roll again, just to make sure. [Goodrich makes appreciative sounds in the background]Kyle: Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you have it, why not?Ali: A seventeen plus three again. [Everyone cheers]Ali: The Fates have chosen my number.Kyle: Yeah. You’re totally able to break the grapple on this thing.Ali: Okay. Can I tell you how I break the grapple?Kyle: Yes, you can.Ali: Alright. So as I’m grappled, I start thinking back like-Ali (as Yashee): How could I get out of this grapple?Ali: And I think back to when we were grappled earlier, and I remember Wimpy grabbing the tentacle and like tearing it in half.Kyle: Okay.Ali: And so that’s what I want to do.Kyle: Let’s say this is a much larger tentacle.Ali: I’ve got much bigger hands.Kyle: You do.Goodrich: And you’re raging too, right?Kyle: You know what? Let’s have fun with it. You’re able to get a good grab on it to start unraveling it and breaking the grapple. Give me another strength check – yes, at advantage, ‘cause you’re raging – to see how hard you pull. I just gotta see if this is gonna work out.[Dice roll]Ali: A sixteen plus three, or [rolls dice] a fourteen plus three.Kyle: Okay, yeah. You’re able to pull – and you squeeze and you’re trying to make it break, and pull as hard as you can. Ali (as Yashee): [raging, distorted growls]Kyle: Oh jeez, yes.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Disgusting.Kyle: And you pinch it really hard, and roll me a – you know what? Roll me a D8 and add your strength.Goodrich: I’ll just say, this time, we hear a “brr?”[Dice roll]Ali: Six plus three.Kyle: So you grab real hard and you start pulling, and you’re only able to make a small cut, like – not even a cut, I guess, because you’re just ripping it apart. So you do some damage, but you’re not able to get all the way through the tentacle. But you are freed of the grapple so that you’re no longer in that for your next turn come around, and you’re raging.Ali: Okay. Well, in that case, I can use dash as a bonus action-Kyle: Okay.Ali: -when raging because of my totem spirit.Kyle: Alright. What are you doing?Ali: So I’m just gonna – I’m not gonna go far, cuz I, you know, wanna stay here to help, but I’m just gonna kinda slip to the side, maybe to the side of the Gil that’s kind of in front of us?Kyle: Okay, yeah. The one that attacked Raz’ul earlier?Ali: Just getting in position to do what I need to do.Kyle: That does move you out of Squid’s threat range, so that’s an attack of opportunity.Ali: Aww! Kyle: So [rolls dice] …Ali: Because I’m raging, remember, I do – you have disadvantage on the opportunity attacks.Kyle: That’s a totem thing?Ali: That is a totem thing.[Dice roll]Goodrich: You totem, Ali. Kyle: If you see critical misses happen, this is what happens. [Players laugh] Kyle: Squid lunges towards you and trips over the tentacle that you’d just broken free from.Goodrich (as Squid): I’m having the worst day ever! Kyle: It’s tripped over and basically like fallen prone, even though they were levitating.Ali: That smooch really messed him up, Spurrier. He is confused.[Overlapping conversation and laughter]Spurrier: Once you’ve had Randy, you’re feeling so dandy.[Players laugh]Goodrich: That or you just have really bad breath.Spurrier: Oh, that too. Totally both.Goodrich (as Squid): The breath was so bad, but the kiss was sooo good! Mmm!Kyle: Alright, so … but that’ll wrap up your turn in that event. Raz’ul, what you doing?Goodrich: Can I – am I able to cast a spell, like, if I don’t use my instrument, like kinda how Randy did in-Kyle: No, I made a mistake. That was a lapse in my knowledge of the rules, and I’m going to try to correct that going forward. So-Spurrier: Poor you.Kyle: -unfortunately, if you’re grappled, you’re considered incapacitated, which means you can’t take actions or reactions. So the only action you can really take is breaking the grapple.Goodrich: Got-cha.Kyle: Yeah, sorry. Sorry, listeners. I’m working on it.Goodrich: Well, Randy’s like a little halfling, so he got some meta luck and was like “ooh, thanks Kyle.”Spurrier: That’s what I was gonna say. Yup.Kyle: Yeah. Me being dumb is meta luck. That’s right.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Alright. Well then, I need to break the grapple then. So [rolls dice] that would be eleven plus three plus Jack of All Trades, so fifteen. And I’m gonna say – is it cool if I just say “JOAT” for Jack of All Trades""? Ali: The JOAT! I was thinking that.Kyle: That JOAT!Ali: He’s the JOAT.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely.Goodrich: So I got the JOAT. So fifteen and then [rolls dice] oh, thirteen plus three plus Joat! So that’d be seventeen.Kyle: Yeah, no. That definitely beats it.Goodrich: Sweet!Kyle: You beat it on both accounts.Goodrich: Awesome!Kyle: So you are free from the grapple, and you have movement if you want to move. Again, remember that there is a Gil near you, so you are in a threatened range if you leave that.Goodrich: Alright. Well, I’m not gonna leave that. I’m just gonna – I don’t know. Maybe all this excitement’s giving me gas. [Everyone laughs] Goodrich: I just toot in my hand and I waft it up to Squid’s face, because he’s like floating in the air, right?Kyle: Yeah. He’s kind of fallen-over floating.Goodrich: So that’s what I do, and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Heh heh heh.Ali: What a bad day for Squid.Goodrich: He’s having the worst day ever.Ali (as Squid): I don’t know what’s gonna go wrong.Goodrich: That’s all I do, and I stay where I am.Kyle: That’s disgusting.Goodrich: You’re disgusting.Kyle: No, I’m not the one shoving farts in people’s faces.Goodrich: You’re the one kissing Randy with a squid.Kyle: Randy tongued Squid.Spurrier: Yeah, I mean, I definitely reciprocated, so ...Goodrich: Okay, well.Kyle: It’s true. You’re disgusting.Spurrier: We can all be disgusting.Kyle: Yeah, we’re all just nasty bard people.Goodrich: We’re all just giddy that Spurrier’s back.Kyle: That’s really what it is. Okay, so Cera’s turn. Gonna go for some tentacle hits. [Rolls dice] Nope. [Rolls dice] No. Okay. So yeah. The tentacles sweep at both of you. You – Raz’ul, one sweeps at you, and this is where you kind of bend over to kinda waft that fart right into Squid’s face.Goodrich: [Laughing] Yes. That’s when I bend over to gather the fart.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Perfect.Kyle: And then it goes right over you. And Yashee, one goes for you as well, but you’ve moved around, and you kind of maneuver your way over it, and your dexterity allows you to avoid being hit by the tentacle. And so we’re at the Gils. I know the Gil holding onto Zil is going to go for a bite – [rolls dice] No, that’s not gonna hit – and the other one’s still gonna try to grapple it which [rolls dice] didn’t hit either. These –Goodrich: Sucked.Kyle: Okay. Different dice, different dice. It’s fine.Ali: So this battle’s over, right?Kyle: Yeah, right?Goodrich: And we run away.Kyle: The two Gils that are in robes, they begin casting a similar-looking spell, and out from their area, these spirits start to whirl around them. And they just stay in their area, but you – they look like they’re protective spirits, like they’re gonna help them out. And then the two other Gils that aren’t holding onto Zil are gonna attack Raz’ul and Yashee. [Rolls dice] Nope.Goodrich: What the heck?Kyle: I know, I know! Dice not working for me today. [Rolls dice] And that one is going to get Raz’ul.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Ali: Oh! Sorry.Kyle: So you’re gonna take … yeah, nine damage. It’s not bad. You take nine piercing damage as one of them catches you in the side as you’re breaking out of the grapple. [Goodrich audibly winces] Kyle: So that’s Cera and the Gils. That’s the end of the round, so let’s go to the top with Randy.Spurrier: Alright. Well, since Squid’s just lying prone on the ground, that means I can do my sneak attack on him, right, because- Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: -he’s within five feet?Kyle: Yeah, you’d have advantage. Yeah.Spurrier: Cool! Well, yeah. So I just look down at Squid and say-Spurrier (as Randy): It was a lovely moment, but it’s time … it’s time to move on. Goodrich: We’ll always have the cave.Spurrier: We’ll always have the cave kiss. So yeah. I’m gonna attack him with my rapier and do a sneak attack.Kyle: Okay. Go ahead and roll at advantage because they’re prone.Spurrier: Alright. [rolls dice] So that first one was a five plus six, and let’s try that again.Kyle: Okay.[Dice roll]Spurrier: That is a fifteen plus six.Ali: Yeees!Spurrier: Hurray!Kyle: Okay, yeah. You hit. Spurrier: Cool.Kyle: So go ahead and roll me some damage.Spurrier: So that’ll be 1D8 plus 2D6 plus 3, so if someone wants to roll a 1D6 along with me.Goodrich: I gotcha.Spurrier: Thank you.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Oooh!Ali: Oh, very nice.Spurrier: So that is a six, an eight, a two, plus three. Nineteen.Kyle: Alright.Ali: Bye, Squid.Spurrier: Bye.[All laugh]Kyle: Yeah. You catch him after falling over trying to get after Yashee, and you take advantage of this opportunity. And you get him right in the side, right under where the ribs would be.Ali: Aww.  Kyle: And you hear like –Ali: It tickles a little but also hurt a little. Ow.Spurrier (as Randy): Enjoy the kiss of my rapier.[All laugh]Goodrich: E tu, Randy?Spurrier: Yes.Kyle: Okay. And that will take us to … to the layer action. The brain is going to emit this psionic ability to Squid, and Squid, after being stabbed, turns and looks at you, Randy, and you can see this glint of determination in their eye. And guess whose turn it is?Goodrich: Squid!Kyle: Squid’s turn.Spurrier: Great, great, great.Kyle: Squid is going to get up, and he is very upset about being stabbed, and actually rips one of the spears away from one of the other Gils and just goes to stab at you in rage, in anger. Goodrich: A lovers’ quarrel. You’re having a row.[Dice roll]Kyle: And that’s actually gonna hit. That’s a twenty.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: yeah.Kyle: So you take eight damage as you get prodded in the gut. And you hear Eddie even go-Kyle (as Eddie): Ow.[Various wincing sounds from the players]Kyle: That’s gonna be Squid’s turn, and that takes us to Yashee.Ali: Alright. Well, I know I kind of set myself up to attack this Gil, but I think it’s time to try to get at Cera up there.Goodrich: Yeah!Ali: So I’m pretty far away still, so I think I’m gonna take out one of my javelins actually and try to chunk it at Cera. Is there a point on Cera that looks maybe more vulnerable?Kyle: No, nothing really stands out.Ali: Okay. Then I’ll go right for the heart of the brain, right in the crease, the fold. Goodrich: Right for the cerebellum, maybe. Errr.Kyle: Okay. So you go to make this attack, and when you do, those spiritual guardians that came out of those priestly-looking Gils, they come up and they kind of get in your face, and they really berate you in ways. [Players snicker]Ali: Verbally?Kyle: Yeah. I need you to make me a wisdom saving throw, because you’re starting your turn within the area of the spirit guardians.Ali: Alright. (rolls dice) That is a fourteen plus nothing.Kyle: Okay. Well, fourteen actually meets it, so I still get to roll damage because you’re only gonna take half. So good job. (Multiple dice rolls)Ali: That’s too many dice. Oh no!Goodrich: Keeps rolling.Kyle: So you take seven damage.Ali: Okay.Spurrier: Phew.Kyle: It’s a kind of radiant damage, looks a little gray in color, but you can tell it’s not evil.Goodrich: Duh?Kyle: You can go ahead and make your attack, but before you do, they also had cast Sanctuary before, so I need you to roll another wisdom saving throw.Ali: Oh my gosh. (Rolls dice) That’s a six.Spurrier: Wow.Kyle: Okay. That’s not gonna cut it, so ... Ali: That’s fair.Kyle: But you’re in the pullback of throwing your spear, like you’re almost on the verge of being able to do it, but then something just – you can’t. You can’t. And it’s -- pretty visibly, you two, Randy and Raz’ul, you kind of like “what?”Goodrich: So we see this, and we’re like, ""What’s up with Yashee?”Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay, interesting.Kyle: You can attack someone else if you’d like, or not attack at all.Ali: Well, I guess I’m next to that Gil still, so …Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Do I wanna hit a Gil? [Goodrich laughs] Can I just … can I just like push him down?[Everyone laughs]Goodrich: Playground rules.Ali: Yeah. Just like knock him into the water.Kyle: You just want to push. You know what?Ali: I’ll kick him, if that’s better.Kyle: Yeah. Just give me a strength check.Ali: Okay. I do have advantage on strength checks. Kyle: There you go.Ali: Woohoo!Kyle: Give me a strength check.Spurrier: Reaching.[Dice roll]Ali: So that’s an eleven plus four. And the second roll … [rolls dice] it’s an eighteen plus four.Spurrier: Nice. Be nice.Goodrich: The Gil skins his knee as you push him.Ali: Right into the water, where you belong, you fish boy. [Dice roll]Goodrich: And he starts crying, and the recess leader comes over and is like “Yashee!”Ali: Blows the whistle.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Yeah, no. You shove the heck out of this Gil and they just go flying forward into the water.Ali: He doesn’t like get pushed into one of the other Gils and they all get knocked over? [Players laugh]Kyle: No. You push him down, he goes about ten feet. He’s prone. So from Yashee we go to Raz’ul. And you are also in that fifteen-foot range, so I need you to go ahead, give me a wisdom saving throw for the potential damage you may take.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Not great. That’s a four plus five for a nine.Kyle: Okay. You’ll take the full damage [Goodrich sighs] of these boys [Multiple dice rolls] and spirits.Spurrier: So many spirits.Goodrich: Jeez.Kyle: You take ten radiant damage.Goodrich: Golly! I’m down to two!Kyle: Yeah.Ali: This is when we start hearing a (imitates alarm sound). Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Where’s that sound coming from?Goodrich: Oh jeez. Okay. It’s my turn to attack though, right?Kyle: Yeah, it is your turn to attack.Goodrich: Okay. So my first thing is to say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, maybe we should try something a little bit more. I’m not feeling so great, you know.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] I was doing my best, okay? It’s all I could manage.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, that’s fair. It’s a moral dilemma for sure, but... Goodrich: Okay. So … but okay, now I’m going to cast Moonbeam as a third-level spell, and I’m gonna cast it on the brain. I guess – you said I saw that Yashee kind of freaked out for a second when she tried to cast it?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Okay. So Raz’ul’s gonna try something different, just after seeing that – and I’ve kinda been wanting to do this anyway, so – and instead of doing the Moonbeam song – which, again, was just for funsies anyways – Raz’ul’s going to look over at the brain and he’s gonna say –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, that’s it!Kyle: Before you do-Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: -give me a wisdom saving throw to see if you can.Goodrich: Jeepers. [Rolls dice] Alright, that’s better. That’s an eighteen plus five.Kyle: Okay, yeah.Goodrich: So feeling good, I’m feeling fresh.Spurrier: Nice.Goodrich: No, I’m not. Feeling terrible. So I look over at the brain and I say –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): In the name of the moon, I will punish you![Players laugh]Goodrich: And so then the camera does that little orbit pan, like it does in Sailor Moon, around Raz’ul. Kyle: Around a bloodied, beaten Raz’ul. Goodrich: [Laughing] Yes. And I’m gonna say – and I hold up Usumptin and I say –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Mooooonbeeeeam Magic!Goodrich: -you know how she like holds up her tiara?Kyle: Yes. Beautiful.Goodrich: Well that’s what I do. And then I cast Moonbeam on this brain. And that’s – Raz’ul’s feeling it, so … yeah.Kyle: Okay. So do you want to do damage now, or do you want to have damage start at the beginning of their turn?Goodrich: I want to do it now, if that’s cool.Kyle: Okay. Yeah.Goodrich: So I’m gonna roll it up. 2D10 says [rolls dice] … oh wow, seven and a nine, so sixteen. So eight.Kyle: Not bad. Okay. So you’re casting Moonbeam in a different fashion. How about you tell me how it differs in appearance?Goodrich: Right. So just different – I was hoping, if this is cool with you, Kyle, that it’s still like the shaft, but it’s – instead of it just being like pale moonlight, it’s like green, kinda like Sailor Jupiter’s, maybe.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: -‘cause of like the nature and stuff. And plus, Sailor Jupiter’s the coolest, I think, and... Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: But yeah, you know, sparkly and kinda shimmery and… Kyle: Bedazzled?Goodrich: Well, yeah, and just more kinda sparkly –Spurrier: Razzled.Goodrich: -- and razzle-dazzle. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Kyle: There you go. So it looks like that.Goodrich: Yes! Perfect. And Raz’ul’s just like –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa.Kyle: It’s all the razzle-dazzle that seems to rub up against the brain and kind of caused the damage this time.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: It’s like giving it a scrub-a-dub a little bit with all its dazzliness.Goodrich: And when Raz’ul does that, I do the pose that Sailor Moon does: I put my hand on my hip and do the three fingers, like “uhh!”Ali: Except you’re also like –Goodrich: Dying.(Everyone laughs)Kyle: Like blood dripping from your nose or something. But yeah, that wraps up your turn, unless you want to use movement. Goodrich: Uh, no. No.Ali: He just falls down.Goodrich: I just fall over.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s all I got.Kyle: Okay. It is the brain’s turn. And before, it had been swiping its tentacle left and right. This time, it just comes up and it looks like it’s gonna go for a slam on you.Ali: Oh gosh.Goodrich: (groans)Kyle: So Yashee, it is going to try to slam one down on you [rolls dice] and –Ali: Welcome to the slam.Goodrich: Yeah. Hey, Spurrier.Kyle: Twelve meets your AC, I believe, right?Ali: Yep.Kyle: Okay. You’re gonna take [two dice rolls] – you’re only gonna take five damage.Ali: What kind of damage is it?Kyle: Bludgeoning.Ali: Okay. I do have resistance to that, since I’m raging still.Kyle: Okay, so half rounded down is two damage.Ali: Woohoo.Kyle: But yeah, it comes down and slams and hits your shoulder. It kinda knocks you off balance a little bit, but you’re able to maintain your step. And that’s going to be its one attack, but it does have another legendary action it can take with another tentacle, which is gonna go for a similar slam attack on Randy.Goodrich: Oh, thank goodness.(Dice roll)Spurrier: Great.Kyle: And that’s going to hit with a twenty-four. Spurrier: Uh, yeah. Kyle: So [two dice rolls] and you are going to take way more damage –Spurrier: Awesome.Kyle: Not way more. You’re only taking ten damage.Spurrier: Oh, phew. Alright.Kyle: But yeah. So for those rules lawyers at home that know the Elderbrain tile, yes, I’m making up my own moves, cuz I wanna do that.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Oh no.Ali: So back off, man!Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: Leave Kyle alone!Kyle: Just leave me alone!Goodrich: Leave Kyle alone!Ali: All right well, just to mention, above the table, I’m at like eleven, healthwise.Goodrich: I’m at two.Spurrier: I’m at twenty-three.Goodrich: Oh, aren’t you special.Spurrier: I mean, a little. I’m Randy.Ali: Randy takes charge.Spurrier: Charge away on Gil.Kyle: The two Gils are still gonna hold onto Zil. The ones in the back that are still near Cera, they look like they’re taking a defensive position, especially seeing that there’s been a spell cast near them, and having seen Cera actually take damage. You see them again casting similar spells, and you notice this green, twinkly light emit all around your foes, and they all seem to chipper up a little bit-Goodrich: Oh jeez.Kyle: -as it looks like they’ve cast Cure Mass Wound spells.(Goodrich groans)Spurrier: Sweet.Kyle: And everyone’s kind of healing up a little bit. Didn’t say it was gonna be easy.Goodrich: [Laughing] No, you didn’t.Kyle: So that’s them. One of the Gils gets up and is looking for a weapon, can’t find one. The other one is near Randy, so it’s going to take an attack on Randy. [Rolls dice]Spurrier: Joy.Kyle: Nope, not with that one. [Players laugh] Yeah, it pretty much just trips and falls over, prone on the ground.Spurrier: Seems to be a theme in this battle. Goodrich: I know.Kyle: Yeah. Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: But that is the end of this round of combat, so let’s get back to the top with Randy. What would you like to do?Spurrier: Okay. Well, seeing people getting healed, and seeing how sweet we’re doing in battle, and I guess – and again, I noticed Yashee like try to attack but fail. Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: You know, I’m gonna take out that flask that we found. [Goodrich and Ali make sounds of being impressed] Spurrier: I guess it’s – yeah. And I’m gonna –Goodrich: Take a huge pull.Spurrier: I’m gonna – yeah –Goodrich: It’s all over.Spurrier: Drink, drink deep.Goodrich: This one’s to you, Chaos Sauce.Spurrier: Constitution check, here I go. No. Yeah. And so when I open it up, I can still hear that like windy sound inside? Kyle: Yeah. You still hear that swirling sound of the wind.Spurrier: Okay. I’m gonna just open it up and point it at the brain.Ali: Yes.Kyle: Okay. You point it at the brain, but nothing seems to be happening. You’re just pointing it at the brain.Spurrier: Okay. Um, is there like anything on the flask? I don’t remember what you said about it.Kyle: There’s just that A with a – upside down A with a tilde going through it.Spurrier: Okay.Ali: No instructions or anything? [Players laugh]Kyle: [Laughing] No instructions.Spurrier: Right. No.Ali: “Step 1…”Spurrier: “Open flask.”Goodrich: Oh man.Spurrier: Can I do like an arcana check on it, see if I know what’s up?Kyle: Yeah, go for it. Roll an arcana check, see what happens.[Dice roll]Spurrier: That is an eighteen plus one.Kyle: Okay. Yeah, you’re seeming to recall a conversation you had with Eddie really early on about magic items and how sometimes they might need a command phrase of sorts to be activated.Spurrier: Oh, okay. I guess since Yashee has often been the one to decipher and comprehend things, I’m gonna turn to Yashee and say –Spurrier (as Randy): Hey!Ali (as Yashee): [raging] What’s up?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, I’ve got this flask I’m gonna toss ya.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Okay…? [Goodrich laughs] For what?Spurrier (as Randy): Well, it’s got this little symbol on it, and I have no idea what it is. I’m hoping, if you can decipher it, maybe it’ll – we can get this brain to get in the flask.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Alright, toss it here.Kyle: Okay. Let me interject here real quick, ‘cause you’re pointing this thing at Cera and you’re turning to look at Yashee. And when you say “get in the flask,” there’s all of a sudden like a large gust of wind (wind sound begins in background) that starts to suck Cera towards it. And I’m going to make –(Various sounds of approval) Ali: Does it say “Mary!”[All chuckle]Goodrich: What’s that?Ali: Jimi Hendrix.[All laugh]Kyle: And according to this item that I have the details for… so Cera looks like they’re being sucked into the flask little by little, just, you know, bits and pieces of it in one long string. And all of a sudden that stops, and it goes back to its normal formation. [Goodrich sighs] And you hear Cera freaking out saying –Kyle (as Cera): No! That’s – I am not going to be trapped in something like this!Kyle: And this is gonna break combat a little bit, but Cera just disappears. (Sounds of surprise) You see it begin to, like – it looks like it begins to cast a spell, and then its body kinda turns transparent and phases out. And you hear Squid say-Kyle (as Squid): No! You can’t go to another plane! You haven’t taught me how to do that!Goodrich: He is such a scrub this episode. That sucks so bad.Kyle: You notice that, yeah, the body just – the body of Cera Bellum seems to be just leaving and disappearing from this realm. And it says –Kyle (as Cera Bellum): Squid, you are a mistake, as I have said. You will be the sacrifice for our exploration back here to see if this will be a reasonable colony. With the existence of … these, it is not. Live your life as you will or can.Kyle: And Cera retreats to another plane.Spurrier: Oh. Goodrich: Cool. Wait, but does that mean Cera’s still in the room, but just on a different plane?Kyle: No. It means Cera’s gone. Goodrich: Oh, oh.Kyle: Cera’s gone. That is one thing about the Illithid, especially an Elderbrain: they think they’re in any kind of like real danger, they are apt to retreat because they’d rather preserve themself than-Ali: Turtle in a little shell, boop boop.Kyle: Yep. [Players laugh] So that’s just one of the characteristics of it. Unfortunately, that leaves Squid on their own.Ali: Totally screwed.[Players laugh]Kyle: You notice Squid’s looking around – it’s their turn in combat – and …Ali: We all gather round him like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, well, well, what have we here?Kyle: -kinda looks at you three, looks at the Gils that are all – they kind of all stop for a second, and their eyes roll into the back of their head. And then they come forward and they’re rubbing their foreheads and they’re like looking around real confused and kind of in a stupor. And Squid kind of looks at you three; he says-Kyle (as Squid): We were just having fun, right? [Players laugh] I mean, “eat your brains,” that sounds so dramatic! I wouldn’t actually do that. You – we-Goodrich: We all laugh just like that and say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Real funny.Kyle (as Squid): I mean, I’m a victim as much as anyone. I didn’t ask to be created. That was – that was Cera’s doing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, right.Spurrier (as Randy): Hmmm. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey.Kyle (as Squid): Certainly.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So Randy, what did you say again when-Spurrier (as Randy): I’ve got this cool little – what’s it called? – oh yeah, a flaaask.Kyle (as Squid): Uh-huh.Spurrier (as Randy): Do you got somewhere you wanna be or somewhere you need to be, somewhere you could go? If not, I’ve got a place for you.Kyle (as Squid): I can leave. I … I don’t even have to have servants. I … I could just walk off into the-Ali: I’m gonna grab the flask real quick and I turn to Squid.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Or you could just get in the flaaask!Kyle: Alright, same result starts happening. Let’s see – [rolls dice] That’s a critical miss! Man, my dice are on ice today! Squid’s just like-Kyle (as Squid): No! I promise I won’t do-[Slurping sound from one of the players]Kyle: And Squid is sucked up into the flask, and the copper top on it seems to just [tongue click] right into place.Goodrich: Just like in the Duracell commercials.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely. And …Goodrich: So what happened to Squid? So what happens in the flask? Do you know what happens in the flask or-Kyle: I know what happens in the flask.Goodrich: Can you tell us?Ali: It’s like a little flasky prison.Goodrich: Is it a little secret?Kyle: That’s – you would have to be in the flask to know, and I don’t think you wanna be.Goodrich: Could … nope, nope.[Players laugh]Kyle: You could. Yeah, you could.Ali: Hey Raz’ul!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Goodrich: So do we just never open this thing again?Spurrier: I mean, that’s fine. Squid can hang out in there.Goodrich: Kyle?Kyle: Yeah, that’s – you decide what you do with the flask at this point. If you never open it again …Spurrier: I feel bad.Goodrich: Hopefully he’s comfortable. Like, what happens to Pokemon in Poke balls?Kyle: That’s a huge theory, and we’re not gonna get into that.Spurrier: There’s a lot to that.Goodrich: Oh, okay. So can we just imagine that it’s like a Pokemon in a Poke ball and Squid’s just okay? It’d make me feel better.Kyle: Yeah, that’s – if that makes Raz’ul feel better.Ali: If that’s what you think happens in Poke balls.Kyle: So yeah.Ali: A little prison.Goodrich: I was gonna say, we’ll just leave that for everyone to discuss. When I was coming up, it was assumed it was like a little spa and they were sitting there kinda chilling. But then they don’t come out healed. Oh boy. Yeah, you said we’re not gonna get into that.Kyle: Yeah, no. They get turned into light and they’re transferred into energy, so…Goodrich: Just like in the flask.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Alright. We digress.Kyle: Okay. So now that resolved.Goodrich: We did it.Spurrier: Hurray!Ali: Well, like resolved, but, you know, that brain could come back at any time.Kyle: Could.Ali: I’m still a little worried.Kyle: But from what it seemed like – yeah, you should be worried. Yes, of course. But it seemed like this was kind of – from what you gathered from what Cera was saying, it seemed like this was kind of a reconnaissance thing to see if it was a viable reopening of this colony, and it didn’t seem like Cera considered that, considering you’re a rival.Goodrich: Because of Chaos Sauce?Spurrier: Because we couldn’t get mind-slapped.Goodrich: So we saved the world? (Gasps) Chaos Sauce saved the world!Kyle: As far as you know, you can believe it to be that.Goodrich: That calls for a song. Roll up those dice!Ali: Vic-to-ry!Goodrich: I dunno. We should probably get out of this cave first.[Players laugh]Kyle: Okay. All the Gils seem to be coming to, and they’re looking around at you. And, you know, they’re just blabbering, gibbering in their typical Undercommon speak and everything. And they don’t seem hostile; they seem just confused.Spurrier: How is Zil? Is Zil just the same?Kyle: No, Zil is Zil.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle: Nothing’s changed about Zil.Spurrier: Awesome.Kyle: They release Zil from their grasp, and they kind of take a step back, and they’re looking at Zil like “oh, odd.”Goodrich: Can I say –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bleep blop bloop bloop.Goodrich: What is that mean?Kyle: You say that, and they look at you like –Ali: Is that somebody’s name?Kyle (as Gils): Bleep blop bloop bloop.Goodrich: And I motion back out towards that cave like –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): “bleep blop bloop bloop,” come on with us.Goodrich: Out the door. Kyle: Okay. So you start walking out the door.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s go find Trish and everybody and- Kyle: Well, it’s actually at this point that you start talking about leaving where you actually hear an explosion happen. [Explosion sound in background]Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: And moments after you hear this, you see three figures fall from the ceiling (Goodrich shudders) into the pool of brackish, nasty water. And emerging from the water, you see our three miners.Goodrich: Alright!Spurrier (as Randy): Hi!Goodrich: I say real quick to you guys-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, real quick. Just play it cool, okay? This is the first time we’re saving the world, we gotta act like, okay? [Spurrier and Kyle laugh] We’re like bigtime now, so…Ali: I’m still raging, so I’m like-Ali (as Yashee): [Raging] Yeah, that’s right. We took you out! Get outta here, little brain, Squid! Never coming back! That’s right!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, okay. But when we get up to them, just play it cool. Like, yeah, no big deal. You know, this could probably up our rate, you know.Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Oh yeah.Goodrich: But yeah. I toss some potpourri in your face and say “hey, chill.”Ali: Oh, good call.Spurrier: And while Yashee’s distracted by that, I just reach over and grab the flask and slip open Joby and slide the flask inside.Ali: Oh yes!Goodrich: Oh, you stuff him, stuff the flask in Joby?Kyle: Alright. Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Since he has a zipper back.Spurrier: Exactly.Ali: Potpourri gets all in my face and I take a (sniffing) a big whiff and I’m like-Ali (as Yashee): Ah, thanks. Thanks Raz’ul. You always know what’s best.Kyle: Okay. Erin’s just like-Kyle (as Erin): What … what’s going on down here? What’s up with these Gils?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, it’s cool. We handled it, like professionals.Spurrier (as Randy): They’re back to normal.Kyle (as Erin): Where’s the Squid guy?Ali (as Yashee): He’s in the flask.Ali: And I look down at my hands and (mumbles).Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Where’s the flask? Wait, where is the flask?Spurrier (as Randy): It’s taken care of.Kyle (as Erin): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What? What did you do with it?Goodrich: I whisper to you –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What did you do with it?Spurrier (as Randy): [whispering] Later.Kyle: Randy, you say it’s taken care of, and Alphonse just nods.Spurrier: Oh yeah.Kyle: Trish chimes in. She’s like-Kyle (as Trish): Well, I think we gotta – I think we got that taken care of, so um, let’s go. Let’s get out of here.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes, please.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Did you take care of the leak or whatever? Is that all good? Are we good to leave?Kyle (as Trish): Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. We’re good to go. That’s a – well, we won’t really know until we get back to Basom, but yeah, it should be taken care of.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. I guess same for us. We won’t really know (laughing) till we get back to Basom if …Kyle (as Erin): Yeah. Well, I mean, if we get on, I don’t know what these little Gils are gonna do, but... Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, we actually saw where they live, kind of.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, they’re from down here, I guess.Goodrich (as Raz’ul: They’re from downtown Cavetown or whatever they call it.Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, I bet they call it Gillington or something.[Players laugh]Ali (as Yashee): They can just follow us.Kyle (as Erin): Okay, yeah. I mean, we’re gonna go back the way we came, ‘cause that’s how we know how to get back to the surface. You know, you follow back. It’s just Cave 101.Ali: Wish I had a little flute, like Pied Piper.Ali (as Yashee): Follow me, Gils.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): All I’ve gotta just say is “bleep blop bloop bloop.”Kyle (as Gils): Bleep blop bloop bloop?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bleep blop bloop bloop. Kyle (as Gils): Bleep blop bloop bloop?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bleep blop bloop bloop. Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, you guys wanna – do we wanna look for our naked boy, or do we wanna leave him down here?[Overlapping conversation]Spurrier (as Randy): I’m fine leaving him, but he has – Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, no, no.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright, fine.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Let’s go get Jermaine. Kyle: Okay. So you all head back to where you had left Jermaine, but Jermaine’s not there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Sweet.Kyle: So at this point, give me a survival check to see if you can track where Jermaine might have gone.[Multiple dice rolls]Ali: I’ve got a four plus three, seven.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: I have a four plus one.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I have a five plus two plus JOAT! So eight.Kyle: Okay. There’s really no signs as to which direction Jermaine would have gone, so there’s really no sense of where to go. Do you want to spend the time walking around, see if you can actually find him? Spurrier: Have we seen our Gil in the midst of all of this?Kyle: No, he stayed back in, I guess, Gillington. Is that what I called it?Spurrier: Back in Gillington. Okay, cool.Kyle: But you still have your Zil and everything.Spurrier: Alright. Sweet.Kyle: And you notice the Gils have been kind of – some of them kept with you ‘cause they were following you, some of them wound up tracing their way back, and some have left.  Goodrich: They’re like, “ehh, another Tuesday. So days without alien invasion, put it back to zero.”[Chuckles]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I mean, if he’s out and about, maybe he went back to Gillington.Spurrier (as Randy): He’s also a sweet cult boy, as we found out.Ali: Mhm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhhhh…Spurrier (as Randy): So I’m fine to leave him down here. He can just hang out here for a while, maybe forever. But it’s up to you guys. I don’t really care. Ali: I call out-Ali (as Yashee): Jermaine?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jermaine!Ali (as Yashee): You here?Kyle: Give me a perception check.Ali: Stick my head around the corner.Ali (as Yashee): Hey! Jermaine!(Multiple dice rolls)Ali: That’s a ten.Goodrich: That’s seventeen plus five, so twenty-two.[Oh yeah! Sound effect]Kyle: Ohhh crap!Goodrich: He’s back with the natural twents!(Various celebratory sounds)Kyle: Alright. Randy and Raz’ul, you hear some shifting and shuffling coming from the room that you had encountered the first Gils holding tiles and everything.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: And you head that direction. And you see Jermaine sitting on the ground, and it looks like he’s wearing a robe similar to what Squid was wearing. And he’s kinda covering himself up and just sitting on the ground, just looks out of it, doesn’t look quite all there. And as you’re standing there looking at him, you notice some of the Gils are also kind of looking at each other, murmuring, and they’re pointing. They’re pointing at something on his body. You notice that they’re pointing to his hands. His hands look really thin, long and emaciated. They look different. Jermaine kinda looks up, says-Kyle (as Jermaine): [in a sleepy voice] Where are we?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh man. Oh man. We’re in this crazy cave, and there was a squid, there was a meat brain boi, but not anymore, because of Chaos Sauce. Actually-Goodrich: -and I hand him a card. [Lauughter]Kyle: It kinda falls between his fingers as he doesn’t seem to have strength.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ll do that for ya. Goodrich: And I’ll just put it in his – pocket? Does he still-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Is there a pocket on the robe?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. You hang onto that if you need a …Ali: I’ll say-Ali (as Yashee): You don’t remember anything, anything that happened to you down here?Kyle (as Jermaine): I remember flashes of him, of who he was. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Who’s that?Kyle (as Jermaine): Whoever …Kyle: -looks down at himself-Kyle (as Jermaine): -whoever this was.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wait, oh-oh. Are you not Jermaine? What’s your name there, slick? You-Kyle (as Jermaine): I don’t know. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Jermaine): I don’t know who I am.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s the last thing you remember? Retrace your steps.Kyle (as Jermaine): There were many like me … in a pool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Like a swimming pool?Ali (as Yashee): We saw a pool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we were just at a pool.Kyle (as Jermaine): But he remembers … it’s all fuzzy.Ali (as Yashee): We can’t leave him here.Spurrier (as Randy): Without the brain, he might not be functional.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. A hive mind sort of thing.Spurrier (as Randy): Possibly…?Kyle (as Jermaine): What?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, tell you what. Don’t worry about it. Keep your coat on, keep that card.Kyle (as Jermaine): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re gonna head back topside, and there’s some folks there that might be able to help ya out.Spurrier (as Randy): Or you can stay here with the Gils.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well…Kyle (as Jermaine): I can stay here?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You like it down here?Spurrier (as Randy): You were also really well off nude, if you want to take that robe off. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I would keep it on.Goodrich: I say to Randy-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [whispering] The card’s in the robe, dude.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, yeah. Well, if – are we gonna come play a show here? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, we could. It seems like it’s okay now.Spurrier (as Randy): Hmmm. Goodrich [as Raz’ul): I would. Dude, we’ve got a sweet hookup with Gil. He could get us booked down here.Ali (as Yashee): There’s really good acoustics down here.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [singing] Ahhhh!Spurrier (as Randy): Just keep nudity in mind. But the robe suits you for now.Ali (as Yashee): I like it.Kyle (as Jermaine): Thank you ... is the words?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): You got it. See? He’s learning.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s go find Gil, let’s go find Gillington. Kyle (as Jermaine): So I-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And you’ll be alright.Goodrich: I try to help him up, like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You’re good. Come on.Kyle: He kinda stands up.Ali: Does it seem like it’s just his hands that look different?Kyle: Just his hands so far. Ali: The rest is very Jermaine-looking.Kyle: Yeah. It still looks like Jermaine, but his hands look weird.Spurrier: Does he still have the mark on his arm of the cult and all that? Okay.Kyle: Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): We should bring him back to Basom, guys. We can’t leave him down here. Can’t leave him really with the Gils either; he’s not a Gil.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, but he can live someplace where you’re not like anyone else. Hey, let’s just get back to Gillington and see what Gil has to say about all this. Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Didididididoo.Kyle: So y’all make your way back to Gillington with Jermaine in tow, and I’m gonna do some quick actions here.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Just gonna do some quick things that happen. You get back there, ‘Cause there’s so many things to do now that we’ve resolved this.Ali: [singing] Everybody needs a montage.Goodrich: [singing] Gotta do it with a montage.Kyle: So you leave the lair and you head back to – I guess Gillington. We’ll just stick with that. When you walk up, you notice that everyone’s starting to crowd around ""The Gil” – you know, the original Gil. Gil is kinda looking at you and just, I guess, smiles, if a fish could smile. Goodrich: He’s just got a sweet glisten in his eye.Kyle: Waves-Goodrich: He’s smiling with his eyes.Kyle: -and kind of parts the crowd a little bit, walks up and just says-Kyle (as Gil): Um, thank you so much. Because you kept your word and I was the only one to remain unaffected, I’ve actually been promoted to being an archpriest and we’re about to do the ceremony. You wanna stay? You wanna watch me get ordained?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, sure. Yeah.Spurrier (as randy): Sure, yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Congratulations.Spurrier (as Randy): Nicely done.Kyle (as Gil): Thank you, Yashee.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, by the way, Chaos Sauce, your friendly neighborhood exterminators, got rid of that pesky brain in the cave, and the squid too.Kyle (as Gil): Mm, a brain? Oh, yup.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yep. So don’t worry about that anymore. You’re good to go. That’ll be about five hundred gold pieces, plus, you know, you got your quarterly checkups.Kyle (as Gil): [stammers in disbelief]Goodrich: And then I slap him.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m just playing, man. I’m just playing. Don’t worry about it. I’m just pulling your fin.Kyle (as Gil): You’re a funny one, Raz’ul.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, you know.Kyle: So everyone starts to gather around the shoreline. Most of the Gils are making a large circle around “The Gil,” and there’s spaces for you to be able to stand and be part of that circle. So the Gils that were wearing those rather dirty-kinda-looking robes — you know, they were a little decorated — they form a tighter circle around Gil. And what follows is a series of events that contain a bunch of gibberish, from your understanding; a lot of stomping; some mud smearing; a little bit of fish slapping; [players giggle] and then there’s an adornment, where Gil is reclothed in what is a surprisingly clean and ornamented set of robes. That pretty much ends the ceremony, and everyone’s cheering, they disperse...Goodrich: I cheer.Spurrier (as Randy): Hurray, hurray.Kyle: You’re all cheering for Gil.[Scattered clapping]Spurrier: [Quietly imitates a trumpet fanfare]Ali (as Yashee): We’re proud of you.Kyle: And then Gil comes up to you and says-Kyle (as Gil): I’m glad you could stick around. I’ve taken care of something for you. It might have been a little difficult when you first came in, but I had some people get this before you got back.Kyle: And you guys never actually picked up your tent garbage when you left.Goodrich: Oh no!Ali: From the S.S. Chaos Sauce?Kyle: Yeah, you never picked it up, you just left it there.Kyle (as Gil): We took care of that thing, the other tentacle thing. We can actually do that; we’ve fought a few of them before. But we went ahead and cleared the way so you can take your trash and [Goodrich laughs] go back to the surface. But you can come back anytime. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Goodrich: And I motion to Jermaine. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, this Jermaine fella, we’re gonna take him with us…?Goodrich: -and I look back to Randy and Yashee, say-[Dice roll]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Take him with us? Leave him here? What do you guys – I mean…Gil?Kyle: Jermaine’s just like-Kyle (as Jermaine): I can stay, I can go. Kyle: Gil’s just like-Kyle (as Gil): No offense, you’re the only three – well, I guess the other three are good too, ‘cause they helped, but … nah, we don’t-Ali: No, they don’t want him.Kyle (as Gil): We don’t want that. You can take him home.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, would you be open to a celebration show, maybe later on? Not right now, obviously. You’ve got some rebuilding to do. But, you know, for the grand reopening of Gillington, we’d love to come back. Right, guys?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Yup.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And, you know, it’s been quite a ride, and we’ve all learned a lot.Goodrich: And I give him a card.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But keep that with you.Goodrich: And I curl his fin over it-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And listen. It’s been a real, real treat, kind of. It’s been something. Kyle (as Gil): I agree. I never met anyone from the surface and …Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes. This is a first for, I think, all three of us.[Wary agreement sounds]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So … Spurrier (as Randy): Also, Gil?Kyle (as Gil): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): This, you know, other – this Zil, that we’ve kind of dubbed him, I’m not sure what would be – I’d be happy to take him, but I understand if you guys would rather him stay here with you.Kyle (as Gil): No, he seems to take a liking to you.Kyle: And you look, and Zil’s kinda just like hovering over your shoulder- [Players laugh] Kyle: and there’s just like a blank stare. Spurrier: I just reach up and pet him, yeah.Kyle: Yeah, it’s a little slimy. And he’s just like-Kyle (as Gil): No, nah.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. As long as you’re cool with it. I just … I didn’t know if it would be rude to take one of your own, even though he’s kind of a zom-bie.Kyle (as Gil): Yeah, kinda seems dead.Ali (as Yashee): Can he survive up there?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re gonna find out.Kyle (as Gil): I mean, I’ve never … I don’t really like bright lights – none of us really do -- but … I don’t know how he’ll fare.Ali (as Yashee): If he doesn’t like it, we’ll just send him back down.Spurrier (as Randy): We’ll just toss him down.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [laughing] Open the hole.Kyle (as Gil): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): So just listen for a plop, and you could … it might happen, it might not. Kyle (as Gil): We’ll post up at the bottom of the hole, and if he shows back up, then we’ll know, I guess.Spurrier (as Randy): Sweet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, we will go ahead and take Jermaine with us, and it’ll be fine. We’ll see what we can do up there for him. So hey, Gil, listen,.Kyle (as Gil): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Take care of yourself down here, okay? Kyle (as Gil): Oh, we will. Now that I’m the archpriest, I should have some, like, bigger sway in what people believe and bleep blop bloop bloop and all that good stuff. So thank you again. And Chaos Sauce forever.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, heck yeah! There he is. Alright!Kyle (as Gil): You definitely have some fans down here in the underside. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Awesome. Well, we’ll try to send down some merch or something when we get some made up, so ... yeah. Well, I guess, let’s go.Spurrier (as Randy): Trash pile ho!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye, Gil.Spurrier (as Randy): Byee.Goodrich: And just like at the end of Pokemon-Ali (as Yashee): Bye, guys!Goodrich: -we’re like walking off into the cave, waving. And Kyle says, “And so, our three adventurers …”Kyle: “…find themselves at the end of another day.” Well, you guys go back. The roper’s dead. You find the hole that you came down, you bust out your tent trash, you recreate the S.S. Chaos Sauce.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey guys, I’ve got something for this. [Singing, accompanied by electric guitar] I like you, trash town, with those Gils, yeah. (Speaking) I dunno. [Players laugh]Kyle: That’s fine. Yeah, you start the song and you kick it off that way instead of the other way, and …Goodrich: Or we just play it in reverse like [imitates rewinding audio]. Kyle: Yep.[Players laugh]Spurrier: That’s all we do.Kyle: Always. Forward, backwards, upside down. But the – you recreate the S.S. Chaos Sauce, float your way back up to the top, takes as long as it takes. You emerge from the underdark, and you’re greeted by an early evening sun. It’s quiet other than the whipping of the wind across the dunes, and then you hear some familiar grunts and bellows. You-Goodrich: The sandatees!Kyle: Yep.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): The sandatees.Kyle: You head over the ridge. You can see that the camp’s been broken down, but the sandatees that you and the miners rode in on are all still there for you to take back.Ali: Alright.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know whether that was a rude gesture or nice of them to leave them for us. Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, probably nice.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I guess a vote of confidence, I suppose.Ali: How long have these sandatees been waiting? How long were we down there, you think?Kyle: I mean, you went down there in the morning, it’s evening. So it’s been about, you know-Ali: Oh.Goodrich: Oh wow.Ali: What a day. Spurrier: What a day.Goodrich: What a day.Kyle: It’s amazing how time works in D&D, it’s very, very-Goodrich: Or as far as we know, it’s been about a day.Ali: Yeah. We work quick, ‘cause –Goodrich: I’m telling you, dude.Ali: -to solve this whole town’s problems.Kyle: Stuff goes down. You did take a short rest.Goodrich: That was just a lunch break, Kyle. I mean, come on.[Chuckling]Kyle: Gotta get those sandwiches, right?Goodrich: That’s right. Yeah.Ali: Oh man. Well, if we’re taking off on the sandatees, I spend like the first five minutes just loving on Sandy like-Ali (as Yashee): Oh, I missed you so much! I’m so sorry you had to stay out here. I’ll give you lots of treats when we get back.Goodrich: Do we do anything for Randatee?Spurrier: No, just stare it down.[Laughter]Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, I’m back.Goodrich: And Randatee again is like “oh?”[Players make quizzical animal sounds]Kyle: You all do what you need to do to get your sandatees prepared, and Jermaine winds up riding with one of the miners back. We’ll just say that. So you make your way back to Basom, and you arrive back in town a little bit after dusk. You leave your sandatees where you got them-Ali: Are we seeing them again though or-Kyle: Oh, no. As far as you know, this is where you’re parting ways with your sandatee.Spurrier: Oh no!Ali: I wonder if I can, like, purchase her or something.[Laughter]Goodrich: Take her back to Strumlotts?Ali: I mean, if she’s like- Kyle: I just did a head turn like Hmmm?Ali: If we got her from like a sandatee rental company, you know, if I could buy her outright. Kyle: “You could adopt a sandatee for a monthly charge. There’s so many of these sandatees.”Goodrich: [singing] In the arms of Yashee.Kyle: If you want to inquire, yeah? You have to inquire about it.Ali: Is there anybody around, or are they closed for the day? It’s one of those things where you can slip your keys in the door and-Kyle: Well…[Overlapping conversation and laughter]Kyle: You know, there’s a gentleman that’s wandering around, seems to be taking care of the tack for these things as you dismount. Kinda looks at you and says-Kyle (as gentleman, with Southern accent): Oh, you got back later than the other ones. Y’all enjoy your ride?Ali (as Yashee): This was the very best time. You know, I’ve really grown close with my sandatee; we’re like best friends, so-Kyle (as gentleman): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): Can I, you know, take her with me? Is that okay?Kyle (as gentleman): Well, no. That’s kinda part of my cattle.Ali (as Yashee): What would you – could we trade or … I wonder if she even wants to come home with me. I guess I should-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You want me to ask her?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, would you?Goodrich: Yeah. I’ve got Speak With Animals. Is that cool, Kyle?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, just see how she’s feeling about it.Kyle: Yeah, you can talk to a sandatee if you want to.Goodrich: So I guess I get off of Randatee and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, listen, bud. It’s been real, but I don’t-Goodrich: Well, I guess first I can do my spell, so-Ali: It’s been nice, but…Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [singing, accompanied by guitar] Talk to me like sandatees do, walk with me like sandatees do.Goodrich: And I turn to Randatee and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Slim. Look, dude. This has been great. You probably want to stick around here though, right? Kyle (as Randatee): Yeaaah. Yeaaah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, yeah. Cool.Kyle (as Randatee): I like the sand on my stomach.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Who doesn’t? But look, it’s been real great. Thanks for taking us out there. Take care of yourself. Hey-Goodrich: And I turn to you, Randy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, we’re good over here so... Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, okay. Cool.Goodrich: I smack him on the butt and-Kyle (as Randatee): Aww yeah![Laughter]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nope, nope, go on and get now. Get in the stable now.Kyle (as Randatee): Aww yeah!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Thank you. Randy, get off that sandatee now.Spurrier: I roll on off.Goodrich: Okay, sweet. And I go over to Sandy and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Sandy, look. I don’t know if you know this, but Yashee actually really – I mean, it seems like you two got along real, real well. And if you wanted to come back with us to Strumlotts, I know that would make Yashee so happy. What do you think?Kyle (as Sandy): Oh, we could do that?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Look, we know a bunch of cool other people at school, and-Kyle as Sandy): Oh wow!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. So what do you say? You think if there’s a way to get you there, you would – you wanna?Kyle (as Sandy): I love her.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aww, sweet. Hey, good news, Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): What’s up.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): She says … yes.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, okay. I mean, make sure she knows, like, what the accommodations are gonna be like. I don’t want her to be surprised about anything.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, right. So hey, Sandy, look. There’s the stables.Kyle (as Sandy): Where.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What are you saying. Hey, look at me. Eyes here.Kyle (as Sandy): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You good? Okay. So-[laughter]Ali: What?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): There’s stables at school. I mean, you’re not gonna be able to sleep in Yashee’s room or anything, but we’d come and visit you and-Kyle (as Sandy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’d be a fun – that sound good?Kyle (as Sandy): Yeah!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Yeah, she’s down, Yashee. So hey, look, doc. So I just talked with your sandatee. You might have heard us doing the-Goodrich: How do sandatees sound when they talk? Kyle: [animal noises] Bellowing and whatnot. The gentleman you’ve been talking to is quite perplexed by the conversation you’re having, and then as Randy is dismounting, Zil is probably riding along with you as well as Raz’ul. You just fit three on one.Kyle (as gentleman): What the holy heck is that? What you got there? A little fish person? Kinda half-dead? What?Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, he’s full dead but full undead. His name’s Zil. He’s friendly. You can pet him if you want. Kyle: He just looks really confused. He’s like-Kyle (as gentleman): You out-of-town folks are mighty weird. Erin, Trish, you know these people?Kyle: And Erin and Trish both nod and they’re just like-Kyle (as Erin): Yeah, it’s a long story. You ain’t gotta worry about it none, Drew. Ali (as Yashee): We saved the town!Kyle (as Drew): Well, yeah. I mean, the water came back and everything.Ali (as Yashee): We helped.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I feel like we’re getting off track here. The sandatee wants to come home with us. Is that cool?Ali (as Yashee): Let’s focus.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Focus up here, Drew.Kyle (as Drew): Okay. I mean, in town, you ain’t getting no attitude or anything.Goodrich: No, I was accidentally talking in sandatee to Drew. Forgot to switch over.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): My bad, Drew. I was just saying, Sandy’s getting all worked up a little bit, so I was trying to calm her down.Kyle (as Drew): Oh, okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, hey, look though. Don’t worry about Zil. Zil’s cool, he’s with us. We’ve had quite a day. If you would be willing to part with Sandy, we could maybe compensate you in some sort of way or maybe give you a song, perhaps. Kyle (as Drew): Hmmm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Like maybe a song you could use for advertising your stable that you could, you know, have-Kyle (as Drew): Oooh, free advertising. I hadn’t thought about that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Free advertising’s pretty good, right? So yeah. If we wrote like a jingle for your shop – what’s your shop called, man?Kyle (as Drew): Sandatee for You and Me.[Laughter]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That sounds like a tagline, though. What’s the real name of your shop.Kyle (as Drew): I dunno. Ain’t really thought of one, ‘cause people just call me Drew the sandatee Man.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ah, perfect.Kyle (as Drew): I never really thought about it. I guess Rent-a-tee.[Goodrich laughs]Spurrier: Perfect.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Perfect. Look, Drew at Rent-a-tee. Is this all you do, sandatee rentals and adventures and stuff? Go see the sand, travel-Kyle (as Drew): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Explore Basom, adventures in the desert?Kyle (as Drew): Yeah, I guess that’s all I do.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Don’t sell yourself short, Drew. It’s good. So okay, we’ve got our root material. Give us a sec, we’re gonna come up with a song. Would you – is that alright with you, if we give you this? This is free advertising. This is gonna drum up-Kyle (as Drew): Yeah, yeah. If anybody sees you with that Sandatee, you gotta tell ‘em, like, you got it from Drew’s Rent-a-tee. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And we play the tune. You got it.Kyle (as Drew): You play the tune, everywhere.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Absolutely. Sweet. And actually, we know a bard in town that we could maybe teach it to and he can-Kyle (as Drew): Oh no, not that boy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, listen-Ali (as Yashee): He’s better than you think.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, exactly. So … we’ll get to that later. Anyhoo, you guys, you ready?Kyle: Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Goodrich: Roll ‘em up!Kyle: Yep.[Music transition]Goodrich: Alright, here we go!Spurrier: Just figures, after our big boss battle, we just write a jingle.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Our boss battle, quote/unquote.[Multiple dice rolls)Spurrier: Yeah, exactly.Kyle: Get a wild.Goodrich: There’s a C. Oh, we didn’t decide major or minor.Spurrier: Well, it’s a jingle. I think it’s major.[Sounds of agreement][Dice roll]Kyle: Oh, you got the wild.Spurrier: Oh, well, well, well. [grunts][Dice roll]Ali: Alright!Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: Perfect. C, two F’s, and an A minor. And C again.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: So … [singing] a drumroll!Kyle: Yep.Ali: Okay. I’m just gonna – I’m just gonna throw ‘em all at once.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Spurrier: Oh my.Ali: Blues are the pattern, purples are the kit. Alright here.[Multiple dice rolls]Goodrich: I’ll leave that up to you to –Kyle: Oh god.Ali: Okay, let’s see. Tails.Goodrich: Alright.Ali: Okay, blue, pattern. That is ten. It’s just ten. Alright. Techno3.Goodrich: Oh boy. Ali: And the kit is twenty-three, which is Fusion02.Kyle: Alright, okay.Goodrich: Oh man, that’s great.Ali: Excellent. Kyle: So I, VI, IV, yeah, and then- Goodrich: Some fusion techno. Let’s get on it. Drew’s Sandatees.Kyle: Yeah, write that song.Spurrier: Jingle, jingle, jingle.Kyle: Listeners, talk to you in a second.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey, everyone, it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle, back just you and me, nobody else.

Or if you want to email us, we also have our Gmail, which is Bombardedcast@gmail.com. So a couple things: you know, we had to do this break.

So you’ll be able to listen through those, you know, if you missed out on it. They’re still there.

I’ll be sure to mention it in the middle bit, like I kinda am right now. So just keep an ear out so that you can win some of that swag that we were giving away. Don’t think I really have anything else to really talk about. I guess they’re gonna write a jingle, so let’s get back to the bards. Let’s hear this song, this jingle. I’ll talk to y’all later, bye.[Music transitions]Ali (as Yashee): Hey Drew.Kyle (as Drew): Yeah? What y’all got?Ali (as Yashee): Hey, I think we came up with something you might like.Kyle (as Drew): Hit me with your best shot.[Drums begin the beat, followed by keyboard, guitar, and vocals]Ali, Goodrich, and Spurrier: [Singing] Rent-a-tee, sandatee, a desert ride for you and me, Rent-a-tee, sandatee, flop across the sandy sea. Goodrich: [singing] If you don’t have a sandatee, then come on down and see Drew! He’ll fix you up and you’ll agree that Rent-a-tee’s for you!Ali (as Yashee): (to Drew) Just say something here.Kyle (as Drew): I got sandatees. Come on down, south side of Basom. We’re gonna have sandatees for you whenever you need ‘em. Uhh. Is that…is that it? Goodrich: [singing] Drew’s the king of sandatees, so he’s got one for all of you, so head down south and you will see, no one can outdo- Ali, Goodrich and Spurrier: [singing] Rent-a-tee, sandatee, satisfaction guaranteed. Rent-a-tee, sandatee, call 555-S-A-N-D!Kyle (as Drew): Well, dang! I mean, that’s – I can’t say I’ve heard a better song about my business, so – ‘cause there haven’t been one, but yay. I like it!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright!Spurrier (as Randy): Fantastic!Ali (as Yashee): Sweet. Kyle (as Drew): And, you know, since y’all be the ones coming here helping the town and everything, I reckon, you know, the least I could do, maybe.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): There you go.Kyle (as Drew): That and the song, so... Ali (as Yashee): Alright! I got a sandatee!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright!Ali (as Yashee): Sandy’s mine forever!Kyle (as Drew): Yeah, you know.Goodrich: [imitates a theme song)[All laugh]Kyle: So he’s like-Kyle (as Drew): I’ll tell you what. I’ll have her ready to go for you whenever you’re ready. You know, just swing on by before you head on out to town to wherever your travels may take you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Drew’s gotta say goodbye first.Kyle (as Drew): Yeah.Goodrich: Aww. A single tear rolls down his-Kyle: Yeah. And Drew’s like-Kyle (as Drew): Y’all enjoy it. They’re having a party ‘cause the oasis is all filled back up, so y’all must’ve done something right.Kyle: And the miners are like high-fiving each other.Goodrich: Nice.Spurrier: Yes!Goodrich: Maybe humming our jingle?Kyle: Maybe a little bit.Goodrich: Oh. It takes a little bit to catch on.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: I whisper to Randy and I’m like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [undertone] Yeah, it shoulda been [singing] “Rent-a-tee, sandatee, write a song and get one free.”[All laugh]Kyle: But Drew walks off to go, you know, take care of the tack of the other sandatees and everything. And you all group together and you start heading towards the tavern. And Erin kinda mentions this as you’re walking. She’s like-Kyle (as Erin): Listen. I know it’s kinda bad what happened down there with Jenny and everything, which, considering, I think maybe that should come from us, from me. I’ll talk to Tony about it. I’ll pull him aside once we see him.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): That’s probably a good idea.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It’s not all great news.Kyle (as Erin): Y’all have done enough, and it’s appreciated. But, you know, it’s a win.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Erin): It’s a win. So let’s get on back to the tavern.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s fair.Kyle (as Erin): You know, enjoy them “libations,” as they call ‘em.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. I mean, I’m down.Spurrier (as Randy): Onward.Kyle: Okay. So you arrive to the tavern, and you can hear the rabble of townsfolk celebrating. And as you enter, there is a loud cheer as you enter in, and you know, they see the miners and everything and see the rest of you. You notice that none of the people from the Bureau are here, but the ones that really stand out to you of course are Tony’s there, Dogum and Symbol are there, and-Goodrich: You mean Luey Hewis. Kyle: No, I don’t. It’s Symbol, in his normal regalia. And you notice that Symbol’s actually talking with Tony, and you see nearby, Tony’s daughter Mary. She has like these long lengths of fabric that are over a support beam in the roof and it looks like she’s trying to pull herself up on them and is messing around with in a kind of – looks like she’s sort of trying to do a dance of some sort using them. Goodrich: Sweet.Kyle: But Symbol gestures you over and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, you’re already back. So … I talked to you not long ago. What happened?Spurrier (as Randy): Hi Splash.Ali (as Yashee): When did you get here?[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): It’s okay. Tony knows. It’s fine.Kyle: And it’s at this point that Erin grabs Tony and says-Kyle (as Erin): We should go talk real quick, Tony. Let’s go chitchat.Kyle: -and they walk off together. And Dewey actually comes over with a few drinks and sets them down on the counter and says-Kyle (as Dewey): Hey, Symbol, so these are your bards, huh, helped us out and everything?Kyle: He’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, yeah, these are my students. Kyle: And Dewey looks at you three, he’s like-Kyle (as Dewey): Hey, I wanna thank you for helping out our town. You know, we’ll get you taken care of for the night. You know, Symbol’s been talking to me. And also, just in general, you know, Symbol helped out Mary a little bit; I don’t know if you looked over there. She’s been kind of down but-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, looks awesome.Kyle (as Dewey): Yeah, she’s – Symbol showed her this – told her about this troupe that he had traveled with, and these dancers danced using silks, you know, hung like they are right now. So whatever you bards do whenever you go to places, you really somehow bring out the best in a dire situation. So I just – thank you from the bottom of my heart and-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh yeah.Kyle (as Dewey): and the town.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Even Splash brings it out, believe it or not.Kyle (as Dewey): Who?Ali (as Yashee): You’re welcome. She looks like she’s having a great time up there. She’s beaming and happy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, she looks awesome.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, she’s – and I think I’ve got something I could work up which I’d be excited to see her use in her dancing. So…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah? Sure. Yeah, that’s pretty cool, Splash.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, no. It’ll be good. Thanks, Dewey.Kyle: And Dewey goes on, because everyone else in the bar is just asking for drinks hand over fist.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So Symbol turns to you and says-Kyle (as Symbol): So what – you know, you need to fill me in on what happened. How did this resolve?Ali (as Yashee): I got a sandatee.Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, okay.Ali (as Yashee): That’s the last thing that happened.Spurrier (as Randy): Strumlotts can accommodate that, right, Splash?Kyle (as Symbol): I’m sure we can figure something out.Goodrich: He doesn’t know.Spurrier (as Randy): Fantastic.Ali (as Yashee): I could always set up like a little – like a little bed or something in my room.Kyle (as Symbol): I don’t think that’s a good idea.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Plus, the elevators might not be able to hold that much weight. But don’t worry about it, Yashee. [Ali laughs] Also, we got a little flask that we have a squid in now. Randy? What happened to that?Spurrier (as Randy): Oh – well, alright. Fine. Spurrier: So I pull out Joby and I zip him open, and I pull out the flask and hand it to Splash.Kyle: And Splash holds it, he’s just like –Goodrich: He’s about to open it! We’re like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, no, no, no, no! Kyle: No, he wasn’t gonna open it. But he’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): So the thing you were telling me about is in – in here?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Well, one of the things. The other thing was a giant meat monster. Honestly, we should probably get with you about, like, our difficulty level when it comes to these sort of things, ‘cause I’m pretty sure that thing was about to freaking smash us. Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, it sounds really off from what the Bureau was antici- -- I tell you what. Let me take this. I’ll go find John and the rest of the Bureau members and take this to them. And – wait, is that … is that Jermaine? Is that their-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh yeah. When we found him, he was like super out of it and-Spurrier (as Randy): He’s in kind of a weird way.Ali (as Yashee): Kinda Jermaine.Kyle (as Symbol): It sounds like – [snickers] – it sounds like a lot of weird stuff going down. So I tell you what: I’ll go ahead and take this, and before the end of the night, I’ll take this and I’ll take Jermaine over there and get him situated back with his people.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh sure, yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): So anything you need from me before I go do that?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, we gave him a card. Can you just make sure he has that card? Goodrich: And I give Splash some cards to give to the Bureau members, like-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): you know, corporate events, they pay really well.Ali (as Yashee): No, we wouldn’t mind coming back to Basom.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Also true.Kyle (as Symbol): That’s fair. It seems like you’ve made good progress here with the people, considering.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): “Considering” is definitely-[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): -operative there.Kyle (as Symbol): And speaking of the Bureau and John and everyone, they’ve actually decided that they’ll be able to stay. Since they’re not able to do the job they came to do, they decided they could stay and help with the mine, which leaves the town in a better situation than we thought we were gonna be able to leave them in. This actually worked out really well. I have to say, A+. [Players cheer] A+ work.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Thanks, Splash. But again-Kyle (as Symbol): You’re alive.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): -seriously, that was super scary. Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, I know. It’s okay. And if, you know, you need to talk to me about anything regarding it, we can and – what is that!Kyle: -as he points to Zil just standing in the doorway.[Players laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, this is my friend. His name is Zil. He’s an undead fish person who I sort of command. But he’s my friend, he’s cool.Kyle (as Symbol): Is this an Eddie thing?Spurrier (as Randy): Unintentionally, but yes.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): We have a lot to talk about on the ride home.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah. Which – you know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But hey, where – is Fingerbones here? We kinda have a song we need to teach him.Kyle (as Symbol): Oh yeah. I think I saw Fingerbones around here somewhere.Kyle: He points over near the hearth, and Fingerbones is just tuning up.Goodrich: Okay, can we go over?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey guys, we should go talk to Fingerbones real quick.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, alright.Ali (as Yashee): Errr.Goodrich: Go over to Fingerbones.Kyle: Okay. And he stands up, he’s like-Kyle (as Fingerbones): Oh hey, hey guys. What’s going on?Spurrier (as Randy): Fingerbooooones!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Fingerbones, two things real quick.Kyle (as Fingerbones): Yeah?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): One, we made a little jingle for the sandatee dealer – you know, the only sandatee dealer in town?Kyle (as Fingerbones): Yeah, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. We made a jingle for him, and we should probably teach it to you because we’re leaving. But-Kyle (as Fingerbones): Aww.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But, but – do you want to come to Strumlotts with us, Fingerbones?Kyle (as Fingerbones): I mean, I’d need to apply and wait for the next semester and everything. Maybe I could – you could put in a good word for me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you think that Splash could get Fingerbones in?Ali (as Yashee): Write him a letter of recommendation or something-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle: Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): -before he leaves.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s bring Fingerbones over to Splash.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: We introduce them, I guess.Kyle: So this is like “okay, so this is”-Spurrier: Fingerbones. That’s his stage name.  Goodrich: Fibbledywiz McFlibbs or something.Kyle: Fibblewicks McFlibbs.Goodrich: Right, yeah, yeah.Kyle (as Fingerbones): My name is Fibblewicks McFlibbs, but they’ve been calling me Fingerbones ‘cause they don’t want to say my name, I guess?[Players attempt to explain]Kyle: Symbol’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): I understand.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Perfect, instant rapport. So Splash, what would you say about some sort of recommendation for Fingerbones to get into Strum-lotts?Ali (as Yashee): He is really good. He is really-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He is really good. Ali (as Yashee): -quick at learning.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He’s better than me at the guitar. I mean, that’s a fact. That’s a rock fact.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. Well, I’ll consider it. I tell you what. Rest up, enjoy the night. I’ll chat with Fingerbones, assess, and if I feel like there’s something I can do, I’ll do it. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool.Kyle (as Symbol): We’ll have to wait till I get back to the school to be able to talk to anybody and put in that word.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sweet.Kyle (as Symbol): So…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, Fingerbones, maybe we’ll see you soon, you know.Kyle (as Fingerbones): You know, there’s gonna be the Bicentennial at the capital soon. Maybe I’ll run into y’all there?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, yes, maybe?Spurrier (as Randy): Sure.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Could we maybe be penpals?Goodrich: Do they have penpals in Beetzart?Kyle (as Fingerbones): I’ve got a pen.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You’ve got some pals. Aaay, Fingerbones!Kyle (as Fingerbones): There you go.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, this has been lovely, but Fingerbones, you keep them bones in your fingers and [Everyone snickers] we’re gonna mosey.Kyle (as Fingerbones): I will. Be sure to write me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Bye, Fingerbones!Kyle: And he walks away and Symbol says-Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I’ve already got lodging taken care of. Dewey — of course the town is ecstatic that, you know … you can see Dogum over there, he’s got so many fish now.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. Shot out of the well when the water came back, shoot into the air.Kyle (as Symbol): They just all came back. And you know, of course he’s saying “Fishtus this, Fishtus that.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. Ehh, Fishtus works through people, you can tell him. Kyle (as Symbol): There ya go. There ya go.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah. It’s all good.Spurrier (as Randy): Perfect.Kyle (as Symbol): Absolutely.Kyle: So you go through the night, you enjoy the libations of the party going on, and eventually find yourself asleep. Same single bedroom, all pile in. Have a good night’s sleep, no weird dreams.Goodrich: Phew.Kyle: No meatball dreams.Ali: Awww…Spurrier: I guess that-Kyle: Well, maybe different meatball dreams.Ali: I’m surrounded by pasta, perhaps, this time?[Players chuckle)Kyle: Yeah, absolutely. Big ol’ noodly meatball dreams.Ali: Or in between two delicious pieces of bread.Kyle: Mmmm.Goodrich: Called Randy and Raz’ul.[Players laugh]Kyle: So it’s morning time. You’re all getting set up to leave in the cart with Mitch and Symbol. Drew brings over your sandatee and says-Kyle (as Drew): Okay. You can ride on back with them, or they can follow your cart. I don’t know how you wanna do it, but here. Here’s your sandatee.Ali (as Yashee): She got everything she needs?Kyle (as Drew): Yeah, tack and everything, and it’s all set up.Ali (as Yashee): Got all her possessions, make sure her stall is cleared out?Kyle (as Drew): Yes. She has everything she owns.Ali (as Yashee): Her favorite blanket?Kyle (as Drew): Favorite blanket? Yes. The one with the stars on it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): She’s got you, Yashee, that’s all she needs.Ali (as Yashee): I’m her blanket.Kyle (as Drew): Yeah. Anyway, I gotta get to tending, so …Kyle: Drew heads out, and you know, waves bye to Sandy the sandatee.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye, Drew.Ali (as Yashee): Okay, Splash, figure this out.Kyle: When you bring it over, Splash is actually loading up something into the back of the cart. He’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): This will be delicious. Cool.Goodrich: Looking at Sandy? “This will be delicious”?[Players laugh]Kyle: No, a different package altogether.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Kyle: And so, yeah, he’s talking to himself, he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): This is gonna be really good, can’t wait.Kyle: And turns and he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Oh yeah, that’s right, you had a sandatee. Okay, just … Mitch, tether – what’s the sandatee’s name?Ali (as Yashee): Sandy.Kyle (as Symbol): That’s right. Go ahead and tether Sandy to the cart. And actually, maybe Sandy could actually help-Ali (as Yashee): Can she keep up? Is she fast enough?Kyle (as Symbol): Oh yeah, I think so, at least on the sand, and we can figure out something when we’re out of the desert. So yeah, let’s head on back. We got some travel ahead of us.Kyle: And before you’re heading out, you’re about to hop into the cart, and a couple of kids with a mom walk up.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Kyle: And they walk up to Raz’ul. The kids are kinda looking at the ground, they’re just like-Kyle (as kids): Mister, you’re … you’re the guy who did the scary stuff with the magic the other day?Kyle: They’re kinda kicking the dirt, and they’re looking kinda shy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yes. Sorry about that. I-Kyle (as kids): No, you don’t have to apologize. We heard that you actually helped our town out a lot. And … yeah, it scared us, but, uh, it’s actually pretty cool. And those-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It is cool.Kyle (as kids): We were wondering if maybe you could show us one more time.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, sure!Goodrich: So I swing down Usumptin and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [singing, accompanied by acoustic guitar] Oh ho ho, it’s magic, you know, never believe it’s not so, children. It’s magic, you know, never believe it’s not so. [Speaking] Sorry my guitar’s a little out of tune, we just … it’s been through the desert. I mean, come on.Kyle (as kids): It’s okay. I was more – the magics going on. It’s so cool.Goodrich: Was it like – the magic, did it make like a little sandatee sparkle.Kyle: Yeah, it did. It did. And the mom’s just kinda like, has her hands on their shoulders and just like mouths “thank you.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Anytime, ma’am.Kyle: And the kids are kinda like “meh,” and they run off and they’re just running off-Kyle (as kids): Man, that was so cool! Yeah!Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: And it’s time to leave Basom.Goodrich: And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bless my nippers. Bless them all the day long.Kyle: So this closes the chapter of our time in Basom for now. And…Goodrich: Fin! Get it? Like you know, the end of movies that says-Kyle: Le fin.Goodrich: But it’s like there’s the Gils.[Players laugh]Ali: You run off into the sunset.Kyle: You’re all together. You got Sandy, Zil’s on top of the cart.Spurrier: He’s faring okay in the sun?Kyle: Yeah, sure. Spurrier: He’s not melting?Kyle: He’s not smelling terrible at all.Ali: You got him right next to Mitch up there.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah, Mitch is just like-Kyle (as Mitch): I don’t know about this.Spurrier (as Randy): Zil, you keep him company now.Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Spurrier [as Randy]: It’s a long ride back.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Zil’s hand creeps over on Mitch’s shoulder.Kyle (as Zil): [Grunts]Spurrier: Just wraps around him.Ali: His one hand.Goodrich: And then Mitch says “it’s gonna be a looong drive home” and then the, like, little circle comes down [imitates cartoon sound.]Kyle: But then it opens back up, listener, and-[Players laugh]Kyle: You’re traveling back to school, and you reach the edge of the Strei desert and begin taking the road east back to Strumlotts, with the Hemphills on your left leading to the beginning of the Dragonspine mountain range. You all begin to hear a dull [imitates rhythmic thumping sound] and Mitch calls out-Kyle (as Mitch): Hey, you should check this out.Kyle: You stick your heads out to look, and you notice a ship with propellers slowly flying through the air. On the side of the ship, you notice a sigil that you can’t associate with anything related to Beetzart. And as you’re pondering this, you see an explosion where one of the propellers is, then, moments later, you hear it. The ship tilts off center and begins to descend. Seconds later, a large bird emerges from the top of a distant forest, flying towards the ship. The bird grabs the edge of the ship, balancing it out. The ship is able to continue on, and appears to be slowly heading towards the capital, Sundance. Raz’ul, you’re shook by this event more than the others, only because you’ve seen a bird this size one other time in your life, and that was when you met your druid mentor, Reed.Goodrich: Uh-oh.Kyle: And we’re gonna stop there.[Theme music begins playing]Goodrich: Oh jeez. Bye! Welcome back, Spurrier![Players laugh]Spurrier: Back to school.[Theme music finishes playing]Kyle: Hey, this is Kyle. I wanna give a shoutout to Fay Onyx real quick, who is @Writing_Alchemy on Twitter. They opened my eyes up to some representation that was really needed, and uh, just wanna say thank you. Talk to y’all later."
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-21-getting-schooled-mvt-iv,"Ep. 21 - Getting Schooled, Mvt. IV","Ep. 21 - Getting Schooled, Mvt. IV[Theme music plays]Kyle: Hey everyone! Welcome back to BomBARDed. Let’s go over last episode real quick so we can move on to what’s gonna happen this episode. So last episode started with a showdown between our bards, Cera, Squid, and some Gils, and that happened to climax with Randy stumbling across the phrase that activated the flask he had found earlier in the lair.Goodrich: Phew.Spurrier: Yeah, right?Goodrich: Thanks, Randy.Kyle: Y’all were really getting the business there.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Especially you. [Players giggle] Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Down to what, two hit points?Goodrich: Yeah. We never really talked about if we got healed up, so I guess the whole rest of the episode, I’m just this bloody little dwarf.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: We walked real slow.Goodrich: Pretty much, yeah.Kyle: So … but that flask tried to pull Cera inside of it. Cera was able to overcome the pull, but that really freaked out Cera and they decided to shift planes as a mode of retreating, and voicing that they’re abandoning their purpose for being there in the first place. However, this did result in Squid being left behind, since Squid had not been taught this technique, and Squid found themselves at the hands of some pretty upset bards and some confused Gils; which Yashee wasted no time at all, grabbing the flask and repeating the phrase Randy had spoke, causing Squid to be drawn into the flask and captured. Goodrich: Uh-huh.Kyle: Before you left the lair, you had located Jermaine, who looked really weird, was out of it, seemed like he had symptoms of amnesia. You had witnessed an ordaining of “the Gil” when you had all gone back to Gillington, after meeting back up with the miners and finding out their success in exploding and blocking the waterway in such a way that they think will be beneficial to Basom.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: Made your way back to Basom, where everything was pretty much resolved, more or less. We tied all those strings together. You did give the flask to Symbol, and you had also mentioned, you know, how Jermaine was a little odd, and Symbol’s like “I’ll take this and Jermaine to the Bureau, to John, and the other bureau members there.”Goodrich: And we did write our sweet jingle.Kyle: Yeah, you did write a sweet jingle, which is how Yashee has a sandatee now.Ali: [Happily] I do!Goodrich: Yes!Spurrier: Hurray!Ali: My little buddy.Goodrich: Are there stables at Strumlotts. I just said it and was kind of in the moment about it. I didn’t really even think. It was like, yeah, there’s stables, because I was thinking Hogwarts.Kyle: Yeah, yeah.Goodrich: With stables and a gamekeeper.Ali: If there aren’t, I’ll start campaigning for it.Goodrich: That’s our next project.Ali: “As your next president of Strumlotts School of Barding, I will build stables.”Goodrich: Or we can start some sort of lemonade stand, like “we’re raising funds for the new stable for my one sandatee.”Kyle: Yeah, I guess you’ll have to find out to see if there’s some proper lodging for a sandatee and a Zil.Spurrier: And a Zil, yes.Kyle: But they are coming along with you, regardless. [Players giggle] And so you spent the night, you know, partying with the townsfolk, said bye to Fingerbones and some of the other characters that we had met, and you left out the next morning. And we ended the last episode with seeing this scene of an airship flying in and having an explosion, and a large bird coming up and basically taking the place of that propeller. Raz’ul, again, you’d recognize this bird anywhere, as it was your druid mentor, Reed.Goodrich: Yup.Kyle: So we’re actually gonna pick up in this moment, and-Ali: Wait, the bird was his mentor or the [laughs silently] … sorry.Kyle: Yeah, the bird was his mentor.Goodrich: Laugh all you want, man. That’s alright.Ali (as Yashee): [In a child-like voice] That’s my mentor, flying up there!Goodrich: Yeah, she don’t know. She don’t know.Kyle: Yeah, no. So-Ali: I really don’t.Kyle: Symbol chimes in and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I guess their magic stabilizers kicked in, lucky for them. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, well, actually, that looks like my druid teacher, Reed. Just gonna toss that out there. Spurrier (as Randy): What?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Could be another giant owl, but-Ali (as Yashee): It is the bird?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): It is the bird. Hey!Kyle (as Symbol): What – what bird?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, you didn’t see that big owl that came and grabbed the ship? You didn’t see that?Kyle (as Symbol): No. I saw the ship level out.Kyle: And Mitch kinda hits him and says-Kyle (as Mitch): Stop messing around, man. What’s up?Kyle: And Symbol’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): No. [hesitantly] I…didn’t see a bird.Kyle: And he pulls out a journal and starts jotting stuff down in a journal.Goodrich: And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wait, Mitch, if you’re here, and Splash is here, and we’re here, [gasps] Who’s driving the cart?![Players laugh]Kyle: Zil’s up front.Kyle (as Zil): [grunts][Overlapping conversation and laughter]Spurrier (as Randy): Tally ho.Ali: Wait. So did we see the bird?Kyle: Yeah, you two saw the bird.Ali: Okay. Just checking.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So Splash, you really didn’t see the bird?Kyle (as Symbol): I – I don’t know what bird you’re talking about.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wow.Ali (as Yashee): Just like he didn’t see the vision when we all touched that orb back in Not-Basom, right?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): I didn’t see anything.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): Sure, Splash.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, regardless, I saw my druid teacher, and, I mean, I-Spurrier (as Randy): He looks huge and cool. What’s his deal? Kyle (as Symbol): Describe to me what this looks like.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, it’s just a giant owl.Kyle (as Symbol): Giant owl.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): And his name’s Reed. He taught me – he’s actually really super cool. When I first met him, you know, it was kind of at a pivotal moment in my life. I was kinda bummed out, like really bummed out, and was doing my own thing, trying to get this whole druid thing started.Ali (as Yashee): Did he take you under his wing?[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, actually. [Laughs]Goodrich: And a single tear rolls down Raz’ul’s eye.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Anyways, um, no. Yes, he did. But he was actually really – he was a really cool dude, and I kinda asked him, like, “I mean, is this weird? You know, I’m a dwarf and you’re a druid person” – I don’t even know what the heck he was, but I didn’t really care. He was really good at being a druid, and so he taught me a bunch and…Spurrier (as Randy): Is he always an owl?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No. He’s like a super awesome druid and can just turn into stuff. You know, like really-Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, so he’s not just a magical talking owl?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, sometimes he is.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, but that’s not his MO.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, it depends on how he’s feeling.Spurrier (as Randy): True. Okay, cool. I just thought you learned to be a druid from a giant owl, which would be cool too but-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, sometimes. But – and I still can’t fly like he can, so most of the time, he wasn’t a giant talking owl. But, you know, when he wanted to go and do his own thing, he’d totally turn into a giant owl.Spurrier (as Randy): Get away from you, yeah.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean, sometimes, sure.Kyle (as Symbol): Randy, how cruel!Spurrier (as Randy): No, no.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nah, he’s not wrong though. I mean, real talk, I suck, I’m not a great druid. But-Ali (as Yashee): Oh really?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m getting better.Kyle (as Symbol): Huh. Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, no, I mean – you know how it goes: you’re learning something, you’re not great at it at first, but I did – you know, it’s fine. I get by, and I seem to be an okay part of this crew and...Ali (as Yashee): You’re still young.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Stop.Ali (as Yashee): There’s still time to learn.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But he split on me, so I don’t know... Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, wow.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I didn’t-Spurrier (as Randy): So he actually did just want to get away from you? [Goodrich laughs] I didn’t mean it.Kyle (as Symbol): Aww.Ali (as Yashee): Flew the coop.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, so – but you’re all telling me that there is a bird holding on – an owl holding to the edge of that ship right now?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Look closer, Splash. Look closer.Kyle (as Symbol): I can see perfectly fine. Apparently not, though. Okay. So an owl, and-Kyle: -he shows you in a journal, he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): -is this what it kind of looks like?Kyle: And he shows you the picture that he’s drawn of the owl.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s a great picture of an owl, Splash. Yes, it’s an owl, just like I said.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. [Players laugh] I mean, are there any distinct markings-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Symbol): -anything that sets this owl apart from the others, other than, I don’t know, being big enough to help lift a ship?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, you ever play Legend of Zelda, Splash? [Players laugh] Still just playing. No, no. No, he’s just a big-Kyle: Super wicked eyebrow game.Goodrich: Yeah, exactly. “Splash’s eyebrows are all on fleek, man.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, it’s just a big owl. He is brown – like, you know, a brown owl, big eyes. It’s just an owl, man. Big owl, big owl. Sorry, it’s just, I haven’t seen this bird, I’m kinda having – I’m a little verklempt over here. So it – yeah, should we follow the bird? I kinda wanna get to school.Kyle (as Symbol): No, I don’t think it’s our issue. If you say there’s a bird saving this ship.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): -it’s gonna work out really nice, because, yeah, I’d wouldn’t really want to have to investigate the crashing of a royal galleon of the Ionian province, which I’m sure they’re probably coming into the continent for the Bicentennial coming up, which-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, Fingerbones was talking about that.  Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah. It’s a couple weeks away, but, um, that must be, you know, the royalty of that province from Alcan. So they – I wonder if they’re talking about opening borders up. They’ve had trade going for a while, and I guess trade has been going well, so – you know, it’s kind of – Beetzart’s limited things as far as, like, people being able to leave or come in.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): Granted, I’m sure it’s able to be done if you can slip someone the proper coin.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): They should talk more about those trade disputes. Everybody loves a good talk about trade and blockades. [Laughs]Kyle (as Symbol): Trade’s a fantastic thing. But luckily, we don’t talk about that, we just document history of it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [laughing] Right!Kyle (as Symbol): But, yeah, again, I don’t actually think it’s our problem. If there had been a crash, now that’s something to write about and document. But, I mean, you could write this in your wrap-up of the Basom journey, I guess, if you wanted to. It wouldn’t hurt to document it, if it’s audacious as it sounded.Spurrier (as Randy): Saw giant owl.Goodrich: Yeah, I write that down too.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, did you get that?Ali (as Yashee): Big, huge.Kyle (as Symbol): Very great job.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): We already got our A for this.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So screw it.Kyle (as Symbol): Such apt bards. Okay, let’s go.Kyle: Alright. So you continue on down the road and finish your travel toward Strumlotts. And you arrive in front of the school and get all your gear out and everything.Goodrich: I say “A chord!” It pops up.Kyle: No, you-[Players laugh]Kyle: No. As you’re getting everything off the cart, Mitch lets you, Randy and Yashee, know that they’ll take care of Sandy and Zil and get them situated.Ali: What does that mean? Who’s taking her?Kyle (as Mitch): [sounding uneasy] It’s Mitch, you know, your driver. He’ll take her over to the stables.Ali: There are stables.Kyle (as Mitch): Yeah, there are some stables here. You know, I-Ali (as Yashee): Make sure she has a really nice one, okay, with like lots of hay and-Kyle (as Mitch): Symbol said if he took the job, I’d have to be stablemaster, because I’m his guy like that.Ali (as Yashee): -maybe like a window looking out to wherever it looks...Kyle (as Mitch): I’ll see what I can do.Ali (as Yashee): [Quietly] Perfect.Kyle (as Mitch): I know I-Spurrier (as Randy): Zil’s fine in like a box or something. [Players laugh] He’s not needy. Kyle (as Mitch): I’ll get him a barrel of water to chill in.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, awesome.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh nice.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe him and Sandy can be roommates.Spurrier: That would be-Kyle (as Mitch): That’s the plan.Ali (as Yashee): Make their own little dorm.Goodrich: I smell a spinoff.Kyle: [makes animal noises]Goodrich: [Singing] “Making your way in the world today takes everything you got.”Kyle: The Odd Couple?Goodrich: Oh yeah.[Kyle sings under his breath]Goodrich: [Imitates another song] Let’s sing all the goofy TV themes.Kyle: All of them. All of them. Symbol is getting off the carriage and he’s grabbing that package that he put on the back. He’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Oh yeah, this is gonna be delicious.Kyle: And he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. I have to go put this away real quick before it has more chance to spoil. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What is it?Kyle (as Symbol): It’s just some treats for me. It’s something delicious. I’m really excited to break into-Ali (as Yashee): Just for you?  Kyle (as Symbol): Just for me.Ali (as Yashee): You didn’t get us anything?Kyle (as Symbol): You had your ch-ch-chances.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But we did save the town, you’d think we could get some treats.Ali (as Yashee): You couldn’t give us a little gift bag or something?Kyle (as Symbol): I tell you what. There’s a process to preparing them. I’ll let you know when I’m ready to eat them.Ali (as Yashee): [Whispering] Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Symbol): And we can eat them together.Spurrier (as Randy): Awesome.Ali (as Yashee): Thanks.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Then we could maybe have that talk we were talking about, where you don’t send us down into caves to defeat giant brain monsters.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah- Goodrich (as Raz’ul): ‘Cause-Kyle (as Symbol): -we’ll have that conversation. I don’t think – I don’t think the next assignment should be a scoop that I get.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): ‘Cause that didn’t seem to work out well, did it?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No. I mean, that was horrifying, right? I mean, can I get a freakin’ witness over here? Like, that was a terrifying experience.Spurrier (as Randy): [noncommittal grunt] Yeah.Goodrich: I mean, okay. I was the only one who almost died, I guess, so... Spurrier: Yeah, I mean, I was like at half health. I was fine.Goodrich: Which, have we rested? Are we-Kyle: Yeah, it’s been a long enough time to where you’re rested up and you don’t have to worry about anything like that.Goodrich: Sweet! Thanks, Kyle!Ali: Take off all the bandaids.Kyle: So, but Symbol’s kind of walking off, and as he does, he says-Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, and be sure you get a good night’s sleep-Kyle: You’ve arrived about midafternoon.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So he says-Kyle (as Symbol): Be sure to get a good night’s sleep, as you – I went ahead and signed you up for an ear-training course. It’s gonna happen in the morning as early as possible, of course, ‘cause that’s how that happens. So – but after class, you can drop by the library to see Mr. Read about another Wonderball treat. [Players make sounds of being impressed] I think you’ve more than earned it.Goodrich: [whispering] Yes.Kyle (as Symbol): But yeah, get some rest, and you can do whatever you want with the rest of the night, I think.    Spurrier (as Randy): Sweet.Kyle: And he walks in and basically starts like running away with-Goodrich: With his treats.Kyle: -with his package of treats.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye, Splash!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Classic Splash.Kyle: So yeah. I mean, we’re back at school, you don’t really have any obligation for the rest of the evening, so what do you wanna do?Goodrich: I rub Randy down with potpourri ‘cause you smell like Zil.Spurrier (as Randy): Ah well, thanks.[Players giggle]Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Does it complement the Zil flavor?Goodrich: No, no, it just masks it. In fact, I’m gonna retcon to say I did that as soon as we got in the carriage, ‘cause he a stinky little boy.[Players chuckle]Ali: We all probably stink a little bit.Goodrich: Yeah. I rub us all down.Ali: Go wash up and change out the old clothes.Goodrich: Well actually, speaking of clothes, I’m gonna lift up your shirt and check your back.Spurrier: Oh, it’s been a while.Goodrich: We haven’t done that in a while, yeah.Spurrier: That’s a good call.Goodrich: Getting a little worried, because you’re calm like a freakin’ bomb over there.Ali: How’s your crack doin’?Goodrich: So I lift it up. How’s it look, Kyle? Kyle: It doesn’t look like it’s changed any since the last time you checked it.   Goodrich: Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): How do you feel? I mean, does it-Spurrier: Do I feel anything different, Kyle?Kyle: No, you don’t really feel anything different. It’s kinda the same.Spurrier (as Randy): I feel dandy. I mean, if you wanna, you know, just do a little fingerGoodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ll poke it, yeah. Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Kyle: You poke it, no real reaction. Still feels like really hard, you know, harder than if you poked skin.Goodrich: Right, yeah.Kyle: Has a give. This doesn’t have a give.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Well, the – you know, same as always.Ali (as Yashee): Find somebody to look into that at some point.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [chuckling] Yeah.Ali: Go down to the nurse or something.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You wanna go to the nurse?Goodrich: Is there a school nurse we could go see?Kyle: Sure.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You wanna?Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, it couldn’t hurt.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Yashee, you wanna go too?Spurrier: See someone that’s got some training.Ali (as Yashee): I gotta go put some things up in my room real quick, but yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, yeah. Well, let’s go, I guess, to our room. Back to our room, our dorm room.Kyle: Okay. So you’re going to head back to your dorm rooms. You walk through the main foyer of Strumlotts and through the double doors. And it’s hear you find Tabitha and Brenda McDade; they both look a little frazzled, as they have just finished picking up papers, folders and books. Looks like they had a little bit of a collision of sorts, but Tabitha is nervously apologizing to Brenda, and Brenda responds-Kyle (as Brenda): Don’t worry about it. I probably would have dropped them myself at some point. But I must be on to review these potential assignments to pair with the available note classes.Kyle: And Tabitha says-Kyle (as Tabitha): Of course. So sorry again, Ms. McDade.Kyle: Brenda walks off toward the offices, and Tabitha rubs the back of her head with one of her hands and notices you three standing there. And she is kind of caught off guard, and you can see that her stack of papers and books begins to slide off-balance. So-Ali: I’m gonna go-Ali (as Yashee): Hey, Tabby, be careful!Ali: How far away is she from us? I’m just gonna run up to her-Kyle: Ah, you know, you could make it in time. Are you trying to help her with the books?Ali: Yeah. I mean, I’ll run over there.Kyle: Give me a dexterity save.Ali: Okay.Kyle: Let’s see how dexterous you are. You’ve gotta beat a ten.[Dice rolls]Ali: Nineteen plus two?Kyle: Oh yeah. You bolt over there before they start falling off and catch them, and Tabitha’s just like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Oh, thanks, Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, that was a close one.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Tabitha, we’re back!Spurrier (as Randy): Hi.Kyle (as Tabitha): I see that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s up?Kyle (as Tabitha): Not much, just – we got back from Beln yesterday. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oooh.Kyle (as Tabitha): And man, is that a depressing little place.[Players chuckle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What did you do while you were there?Kyle (as Tabitha): We tried to play at the tavern, just to, like, kind of raise spirits, ‘cause they lost their mayor recently.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-oh.Kyle (as Tabitha): And-Ali (as Yashee): Wait, we’ve been there, right?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, that’s where we played.Goodrich: How does that work?Kyle: No, you three haven’t been there.Goodrich: Okay. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Tabitha, outside of this timeline, in an alternate dimension, we’ve totally been to Beln and it was awesome.Ali (as Yashee): I’ve heard a story about Beln before somewhere.Goodrich: About these three bards. No, just kidding.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, that sucks. We actually kind of went on a crazy adventure-Goodrich: And I tell her everything up to going into the hole.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah. I gave you that call to make sure you were okay, because somehow you guys left this plane?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh yeah. Okay, Tabitha, listen.Kyle (as Tabitha): Mm-hmm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): When you play with your crew, with your group, does, like, wicked crazy things happen? Like, super out of the ordinary? Kyle (as Tabitha): No, nothing really out there crazy. I mean, we’ve – we’ve been practicing a lot. But nah. I mean, you know, we’re able to achieve some form of magical effect, but it’s pretty minimal.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): Well, what about when you’re by yourself, doing magical stuff? I mean, we saw that one time in the practice room, things got a little…different.Kyle (as Tabitha): Oh.Kyle: She goes a little flush and is like-Kyle (as Tabitha): I – yeah. That’s – that’s something else, that’s not bard-related.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): How did you know left a plane? What is–Kyle (as Tabitha): Uh…Spurrier (as Randy): Seems some pretty in-depth knowledge.Kyle (as Tabitha): I was told.Spurrier (as Randy): By…?Ali (as Yashee): Wait, did I tell you that?Kyle (as Tabitha): Uh, no.Ali (as Yashee): I don’t think I told you that.Kyle (as Tabitha): By the being you met in the practice rooms.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, yeah.Kyle (as Tabitha): They kind of let me know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you still do that sort of thing?Kyle (as Tabitha): I mean, it’s an on-and-off kind of conversation.Spurrier (as Randy): Is it healthy?Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, it’s fine. It’s gotten me to where I am now, and it’s given me more power than I thought I would have to do what I need to do. Which…I don’t know if we’re there yet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Kyle (as Tabitha): So tell me this though: You guys went with Chaos Sauce for your name?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Yep.Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think it’s working pretty well, actually.Ali (as Yashee): [whispering] Give her a card. Give her a card.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, you want a card? Here.Goodrich: And I give her a card.Kyle (as Tabitha): [to herself] Oh dang it, now he’s gonna want a card. Okay, well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Who wants a card? What?Kyle (as Tabitha): Garreth.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You want more? Oh yeah, give one to Garreth, too.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But don’t tell him it’s us. Tell him it’s like this super awesome band you heard of and you wanna go to one of their shows real bad. And then it’s our show, and then-Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): -you know what I mean. So it’s a funny kind of joke, and then it’s a...Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, we’re – I mean, it depends on if we wind up being in the same area, I guess. But, um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Don’t worry about it.Kyle (as Tabitha): You know [scoffs] Garreth wanted to go with the North Stars and-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s a cool name.Kyle (as Tabitha): [sighs] It’s not bad. I mean, at least I like stars, and Ilda seems to be eating up anything that he throws on the floor, so-Spurrier (as Randy): Gross.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Well, does he say – he’s kind of your front man, right?Kyle (as Tabitha): [snickers] Yeah, I guess. He forces his way up there. But-Goodrich: Yeah. It is maybe a little bit egotistical of a name. I don’t know.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): If you don’t take into account his last name, I think it’s a pretty sweet name. But-Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh well.Kyle (as Tabitha): So…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are you gonna stay with it, you think or-Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, I think that’s what I’m stuck with, but-Ali (as Yashee): I like it, but if you have something better, you should bring it up to him. Don’t let him take the lead all the time.Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, see, we don’t have cards made, so I guess it’s not set in stone or anything.Ali (as Yashee): Just make your own cards, and be like”no”-Kyle (as Tabitha): “This is it.”[Players chuckle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s what I did. I didn’t ask those two chuckleheads about cards; I just made some up.Kyle (as Tabitha): You just kind of strong-arm it, okay. Yeah, I see. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But I made the cards – never mind. It’s not important. Hey, listen.Kyle (as Tabitha): Right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’ve got a couple of things to take care of, just getting back. I mean, Randy and I gotta check on … some stuff and put some things away. Yashee, do you wanna-Ali (as Yashee): I needed to go back to my room real quick.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): I wanna go eat though; I don’t know about you guys. I’m famished from the road. Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, sure, yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Tabby, you wanna grab some food with us?Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, I think I’m actually forgetting something. What was it?Kyle: And then at this point, some of the other doors that lead further into the school open up, and you see Garreth walk in, and Ilda is, you know, closely in tow behind. And Garreth just snaps out, says-Kyle (as Garreth): Tabitha! There you are! You’re late for practice again!Kyle: And you can just hear Ilda go-Kyle (as Ilda): Humph! Humph!Kyle: -and nod. And-Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Man, just lay off, alright? She ran into McDade with the books and they fell on the ground. Just relax, alright.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, I was just talking to Chaos Sauce here and they-Kyle: And Garreth says- Kyle (as Garreth): Chaos Sauce, huh?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle: And he looks you three over, he’s like- Kyle (as Garreth): You’re the mooks that stole my letter and tried to put it back. Yeah, I remember you yelling your name down the hallway after running away. Can’t say I’ve heard of you for any other reason, but yeah. Maybe getting kicked out of school for stealing another student’s property may gain you some infamy that you’re looking for.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh no, that was the other Chaos Sauce.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, I don’t remember that happening.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Garreth): Yeah, no, I think I would recognize at least two shorties and a big tall-Goodrich: [rolls dice] Let’s roll some deception. Ooh, that’s a five.Kyle: Not good.Goodrich: Nope.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, well, you know, it was all in good fun. We were just kinda doing-Kyle (as Garreth): Good fun, huh? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. I mean-Kyle (as Garreth): Yeah, yeah. Well, watch yourselves, ‘cause I know people.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh?Garreth: People who pull strings. And I’m not talking about the students studying marionettes here. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. Well, if you do, here’s a card. Pull some strings, get us a gig or something, right?Kyle: And he just kinda turns his nose up at your card. And Ilda jumps out from behind his legs, goes-Kyle (as Ilda): You shouldn’t steal; it’s bad. And Tabitha, you knew Garreth scheduled practice for every day at this time. Kyle: Tabitha says-Kyle (as Tabitha): I don’t know why you’re pushing so hard to do the Academicon early. They will not let the three of us, as first-year students, take the Academicon.Kyle: And Garreth replies-Kyle (as Garreth): Yeah, that’s the level of determination that doesn’t get you anywhere. So why don’t we just go ahead and go practice like we’re scheduled, and leave these … Chaos Sauce alone.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sure. We actually have to go practice too. Don’t we, guys?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Kyle (as Garreth): I bet you do.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Enjoy doing it every single day. Obviously you’re going to need it. Make sure to look north, to all the stars.[Players snicker]Kyle (as Garreth): [angry sounds]Kyle: And he fumes a little bit, and he’s just – turns and walks away.Spurrier (as Randy): [Softly] Byee.Kyle: And Ilda gives you a small scowl and goes-Kyle (as Ilda): [angry whine]Goodrich: Uh.Kyle: And walks off behind Garreth. And Tabitha just looks at you three and goes-Kyle (as Tabitha): I don’t – I don’t know.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s the hand you were dealt. It’s not your fault.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe you can start having secret practice with us.Kyle (as Tabitha): We’ll see. I can only hope, right?Kyle: And she starts to trudge off, following behind.Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: It’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): I’ll talk to y'all later.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Have fun practicing.Ali (as Yashee): Okay. See you later.Kyle (as Tabitha): See ya.Kyle: And they all walk off. So, after that having happened, you’re gonna go to your rooms, get washed up. Yashee- Ali: Gonna get some food, maybe.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay.Ali: We can go to the library soon too, right?Goodrich: Yeah. Well, and do we want to see the nurse first real quick? Spurrier: I mean, we can try.Goodrich: OkayKyle: What do you want to do first?Goodrich: Let’s do the nurse first. Kyle: Nurse first.Goodrich: I mean, I don’t know.Ali: That’s fine.Goodrich: That’s what I’m thinking, like, that’s what Raz’ul’s thinking. Like, I mean, we’re here, there’s someone that can maybe check it out. Is the nurse in this school just a cleric or-Kyle: Uh, you don’t know.[Overlapping conversation]Ali: Yeah, let’s just go do that first.Spurrier: Mosey.Kyle: Okay. So you make your way around the school and follow the signs that say “hey, nurse, this way.” [Players chuckle] “Nurses’s office, over here. Keep walking.” And you find yourself at the nurse’s office, and there’s a little placard on the outside that says “Nurse Odejoy.”Goodrich: Odejoy.[Players giggle]Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Alright. Yeah, let’s go inside, I guess.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: So you open the door, and there’s the nurse standing. She has a cupboard open and she’s pulling things out of it and looking at them. And she turns to greet you three. She’s wearing a nice long, flowing kind of laboratory coat and a black pantsuit underneath it. Goodrich: Nice.Kyle: And-Goodrich: Does it have a big bow on the back?Kyle: Yeah, a big bow on the back, and pink hair and Nurse Odejoy.Goodrich: Right. [Laughs]Kyle: Yeah. So-Ali: I go-Ali (as Yashee): Hellooo, nurse! [Players laugh] Hi.Kyle: She says-Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Oh, hi. Welcome to the nurse’s office.Kyle: You can see she’s wearing some certain symbolism that represents Pranus, who you know to be the daughter of Altonia, the goddess of health and redemption. Goodrich: Sweet.Kyle: So she says-Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): How can Pranus’s blessing find you today?Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [singing] Doctor, Doctor, give me the news!Goodrich: Is that what you say, Randy?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): You’ve got a bad case?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Of Randy’s-Ali (as Yashee): The crack in the back.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Big crack in the back, that’s – haha, funny, funny. You can leave.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, no, no, wait, wait.Spurrier (as Randy): That would be the crack further down the back. This is a higher-up crack in the back.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you wanna show Nurse Odejoy your crack?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): You cracked a bone? Spurrier (as Randy): No, let me just show you, if that’s okay.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Okay, have a seat right up here.Kyle: -and slaps a parchmented table.Goodrich: That’s not funny, Kyle, you’re asking Spurrier if he cracked a bone.Kyle: Oh, yeah.Goodrich: That’s poor-[Players laugh]Kyle: I wasn’t thinking about it.Goodrich: I’m just playing.Kyle: I know.Spurrier: Alright. Well, I hop on up and rip off my shirt.[Players laugh]Goodrich: All in one movement?Spurrier: [makes swooshing sound]Goodrich: Midair, just “waaa.”Spurrier: That shirt’s gross anyways. It’s got all sorts of Zil slime and stuff on it. So yeah, rip off the shirt, and say-Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, there’s a crack, and I don’t know if you dabble in sweet, sweet magic ink, but we’ve got that going on, too. I didn’t get this administered, it just kind of showed up one day.Kyle: She steps around behind you and kind of, like, looks at it studiously, puts her finger on her lips, and just like contemplates for a minute. She says-Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): This is a hodgepodge of a bunch of different things you have going on here. Uhh, there’s so much here that I can’t make heads or tails of what starts what enchantment and what limits what ward.Goodrich: And I reach up real quick and like reach up. I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, don’t forget, there’s a big crack up there, too. That’s what we’re here about.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy):   Yes, I – yes, I understand. I see that.Ali (as Yashee): You can poke it.Spurrier (as Randy): By all means.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle: She puts a glove on-Goodrich: I was about to say.Kyle: -and pokes in. She’s like-Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Oh, that’s very disconcerting. Um, I tell you what.Kyle: And she turns around and opens up a book and starts flipping through things. She’s like-Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Um, I mean, this is a lot going on here, but I think there’s some divination I could do. However, I don’t have the material components for it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s cool. We actually don’t play with, really, material components in this game.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Oh, but this is different. For me, you know, maybe you have ways of getting around those-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Riiight.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): -that the heavens allow for some reason. Um, but perhaps if you could bring me 250 gold pieces’ worth of incense, and I will need four strips of ebony worth about fifty gold pieces each.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, cool. Do you know where we could find that stuff?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Probably any major market; Sundance, if you happen to be going there or on assignment.Spurrier (as Randy): Does the incense need to be a certain flavor, like nag champa or anything like that?   Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): No, just any general incense you can get.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ve got potpourri, does that count?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Uh, do you have 250 gold pieces’ worth?Goodrich: I guess I could just bring her later what I have and see how much more we need.Kyle: I will tell you this: you do not have 250 gold worth of incense on you.Goodrich: Okay. That’s fair.Kyle: You probably maybe have like ten – [Players laugh] – on you at any point in time.Goodrich: That’s fair, that’s fair, that’s fair.Kyle: This is gonna be a big bag of incense.Ali (as Yashee): That’s like a lot of gold pieces.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): I know, and it’s a very taxing process.Ali (as Yashee): Could the school maybe cut us a check for it or … no?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): I mean, you get paid for your duties at the school as well as gaining education, so…Ali (as Yashee): We do?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhh…Ali (as Yashee): I didn’t realize we get paid.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): When does that check come in?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): I guess it’s more so you get paid from being assigned to go places, and you might get paid that way. [Players make sounds of dawning understanding] I don’t know. I just nurse here, so...Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Giggles] Yeah. Okay. Cool, Doc. Well-Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): If you do that, I’ll be willing to perform the – cast that spell for you. And maybe we can find out a little bit more information. Bring that back to me when you’re ready though.Spurrier (as Randy): From what you can tell, is there like a time limit on how quickly we should act on that or…Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Uh-Spurrier (as Randy): If it’s gotten a little bigger as time has gone on, hasn’t changed super recently, but, uh, putting that out there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right now, he’s comfortably numb, you could say.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): [pauses] Okay. [Goodrich laughs] I probably wouldn’t want to wait, you know, too much longer. I mean, the overall ward seems to be intact, so I think once it maybe would crack through the outer circle, you might actually lose the arcanic flow of magic that is imbued into it.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): So sooner than later.Spurrier (as Randy): Sure. I’ll keep that in mind.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): I can put a Band-aid on it if you’d like.Spurrier (as Randy): Will that do anything?Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): No.[Players snicker]Spurrier (as Randy): Then that’s okay.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): But I have these teddy bear ones, if you like teddy bears.Goodrich: Aww, get a sticker.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. That I can do, yeah.Kyle: Puts a teddy bear sticker on there.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, do you also have like maybe a blanket I could borrow? I sort of ripped my shirt in half. I don’t wanna be showing this off to the whole school.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Yeah, no, that’s-Spurrier (as Randy): I’ll bring it right back when I change.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): You don’t have to worry about it.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, thank you.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Here’s a blanket.Spurrier (as Randy): Thanks.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Toodle-oo.Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): Have a good day. Come back and see me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye.Ali (as Yashee): Alright. Kyle (as Nurse Odejoy): But only if you need me. Bye.Kyle: Okay. So you head back to the rooms, drop off anything that you were carrying with you, and change.Ali: I go in and open up my spoon cabinet.Kyle: Okay.Ali: And I’m gonna – I need to rearrange them a little, ‘cause my new spoon is like real tinny sounding, so I can put it on – closer to the right. Kyle: You got it on the right row, column area.Ali: Yeah, yeah, yeah.Goodrich: I light up some potpourri real quick, just for, you know, when we get back and whatnot. Kyle: Yeah. Your secret stash.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: I just spend some time with Joby.Goodrich: Awww.Ali: Do we have a-Kyle: Introducing him to your new bear Band-aid?Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: Like “check out little me, Joby?”Spurrier (as Randy): This is you.Ali: Your little friend. Do we have like a little mini fridge?Goodrich: For the finger?Ali: Yeah.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah. Sure.Ali: Ok. I just stick that in there for later. Kyle: Okay. So you store that away.Spurrier: Probably put the bottle of Zil goo in there too.Ali: Ooh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: So … but you’re ready to go, and you head on out. And you’re making your way down to the library. You walk in, and Mr. Read’s behind the table. There’s some students sitting around, reading; some of them are in the aisles, pulling books. There are floating carts that are going back, and books are just magically going back on the shelf.Goodrich: Nice.Kyle: So … but Mr. Read looks up and looks at you three and goes-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Welcome back.Spurrier (as Randy)Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re back.Kyle (as Mr. Read): How has it been going? Haven’t seen y’all in a little while.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Boy, has it been crazy. Don’t worry about it though. Splash-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Not gonna.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yep, yep. Classic Read, or Mr. Read. Oh boy.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Huh?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Anyhoo, Splash said there were going to be maybe some Wonderballs for us?Kyle (as Mr. Read): Uh, yeah, he let me know about that. However, you might have to come back in the morning.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh?Kyle (as Mr. Read): Um, he told me he told y’all to wait till after class tomorrow morning, but-Ali (as Yashee): He didn’t.Kyle (as Mr. Read): -he must not have. So … but yeah, there’s actually a person from AU here that’s working on it. Something had happened with an arcanic capacitor, overloaded. We’ve actually lost all the different passphrases and everything-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-oh.Ali (as Yashee): Oh no.Kyle (as Mr. Read): -so when you come back tomorrow, it should be ready to go. And we’ll have to redo those, but it should still work the same nonetheless. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Food!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, alright. Well, we tried. Kyle (as Mr. Read): Alright.Ali (as Yashee): Sounds great.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): See you tomorrow, Mr. Read.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye.Kyle: Alright. So you head off. He gives you a wave, says-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Farewell. See you tomorrow. Drop back by. Bye.Kyle: You make it to the cafeteria, and it’s close to dinnertime. There’s a good line going on; people are standing in line, performing for their food-Goodrich: Oh boy.Kyle: -as they should.Goodrich: Right! Jeez.Kyle: There’s a lot more students than you realized, actually, that went to Strumlotts that are here. [Players laugh] And-Ali: I thought it was just like six people.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Yeah, no. You finally see it’s like, okay, there’s actually people that go here. Some people are just eating; some people have books with them that they’re studying. You notice in the corner there’s a few students that are milled around and they’re rolling dice, and it looks like they have some gold out on the ground.Goodrich: Oooh.Kyle: So what do y’all wanna do?Spurrier (as Randy): Um, well, before I get food—or maybe one of you guys can get me some food—I’m gonna go see what’s up with those dice-rolling boys. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Just be careful now. Don’t let ‘em take all your money. Spurrier (as Randy): It’ll be fine.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. What do you want? I’ll go get you something.Spurrier (as Randy): Whatever.Goodrich: Is that – I mean, can I order food?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay, sweet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Just whatever?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, sweet.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s food.Ali (as Yashee): I had a little snack back but I’m – I mean, I still want to eat. So can you actually get me something too?Spurrier (as Randy): A big ole order.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I got it.Ali: I actually wanted to see if there’s like – maybe a school, like, bulletin board or something.Kyle: Okay.Ali: With like events or just, you know, be like an active [Goodrich laughs] member – like school member.Goodrich: You wanna be on the student council?Ali: Yeah, maybe.Goodrich: Yeah, for sure.Kyle: Okay, let’s do this. Sounds like Raz’ul’s going to be ordering food, so Raz’ul, you take a moment and come up with something you want to play to get the food.  Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: We’re not going to do like a whole song production of this, so-Goodrich: I was about to ask you. Yeah, okay, sweet.Kyle: Take five minutes and get that knocked out. I’m gonna have to take a minute to see what’s going on with a bulletin board, but what I can do right now is: Randy, you walk over and these people are playing some dice. They’re all, you know, betting, and it seems to be like a one-on-one kind of thing, where people are cupping their dice over and they’re playing like, you know, “Oh, high, low.”  So, you know, you stand there for a few moments, and you see this one person really seems to dominate. And it’s a little gnome and he’s got like a few fifes that are like kind of on his arm that he’s got ready to go, pulls them out and plays when he needs them. But he’s rolling dice and seems to be just killing it.Spurrier: Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, hello.Kyle (as gnome): Oh hey. What’s going on? You coming to roll some dice, lose some money?Spurrier (as Randy): I would love to.Kyle (as gnome): Okay. Alright. Well, I tell you what. [chuckles] Fred just got the best of him taken, so why don’t you go and have a seat, and let’s see if we can get the best of you too.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool. What are we playing?Kyle (as gnome): Ah, we’re just – we’re rolling some dice, and if you think it’s gonna be a total under twelve between the two of us, you know, you can go high; if you think it’s gonna be over twelve between the two of us, or you can call it low.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool.Kyle (as gnome): So-Spurrier (as Randy): You ever play an alternate version where you play evens and odds?Kyle (as gnome): Evens and odds. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What’s that?Spurrier (as Randy): Basically what it is: you call if you think the total’s gonna be even or if you think the total’s gonna be odd.Kyle (as gnome): Okay. Yeah, let’s try out your game, see what – you know, you’re new to the table. Let’s play your game and give you a fair chance, I guess.Spurrier (as Randy): That’s good of you. Appreciate it. How much you got there?Kyle (as gnome): Uh, well, I mean, I’m willing to put down, huh, fifty.Spurrier (as Randy): Fifty?Kyle (as gnome): I could go fifty on the first bet and we can-Spurrier (as Randy): -go from there.Kyle (as gnome): -spice it up from there.Spurrier (as Randy): Done.Kyle (as gnome): Alright. Well, go ahead. Bust out your cup and you can get some dice, and let’s start rolling.Spurrier (as Randy): After you. And oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t catch your name.Kyle (as gnome): Oh, Gerard.Spurrier (as Randy): Gerard, nice to meet you. I’m Randy, and this is Joby.  Kyle (as Gerard): Nice to meet you, Randy and … Joby.Spurrier (as Randy): Mhm.Kyle (as Gerard): Your bear.Spurrier (as Randy): [slowly] Yes.Kyle (as Gerard): Alright, hey.Spurrier (as Randy): You want some money or not?Kyle (as Gerard): Yeah, I’ll take your money.Spurrier (as Randy): Game on.Kyle (as Gerard): Let’s go. Go ahead and roll them dice.Kyle: And throws his dice in the cup, shakes it up – [sound of dice rolling] – and covers it.Spurrier: Should I just roll mine?Kyle: Yeah. You go ahead and roll your six-sided dice and keep it to yourself. 2D6, right?[Dice roll]Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Kyle (as Gerard): I’ll start off, and yeah, let’s say it’s gonna be even. I think it’s gonna be even.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, let’s just do the opposite then.Kyle (as Gerard): Okay. So you’re going with odd, huh?Spurrier (as Randy): Mhm.Kyle (as Gerard): Alright. Uh, tell you what: before we reveal this, how about we make it more interesting. Twenty-five more gold?Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s make it fifty more gold.Kyle (as Gerard): Oh, okay.Spurrier (as Randy):Lohoho.Kyle (as Gerard): Yeah, let’s go ahead and – go ahead and do that. Um, you wanna reveal what we got here and see where we’re at?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Gerard): Okay.Kyle: And he pulls off his cup, and he reveals that he’s got seven total on his dice.Spurrier: I pull mine up and show that I have six.Kyle (as Gerard): Okay, alright. Fair and square. I like that.Spurrier (as Randy): Beautiful, beautiful.Kyle (as Gerard): Alright. You wanna give a man a chance to, you know, get his money back? We can go another fifty and fifty.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. Let’s go one more.Kyle: So you’ve made a hundred gold so far in this first bet. Ali: Nice. Get that back taken care of in no time.Goodrich: It’s a double or nothing.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, I was gonna say, you know, I’ve got some - I’m pretty hungry, just got back from a long journey – we’re Splash’s students.Kyle (as Gerard): Who?Spurrier (as Randy): Which – well, Symbol goes by “Splash.” Sorry. I need to make that preface.Kyle (as Gerard): That seems like an awkward name change, but-Spurrier (as Randy): It super is, but it was his-Kyle (as Gerard): -I’ll take your word for it.Spurrier (as Randy): It was his call. He’s got it embroidered on his shirt now; like it says “Hi, my name is Splash.” It’s just a whole thing.Goodrich: He’s got merch! [Laughs]Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. But it’s fine. You wanna go all in? I’m kinda busy, I’m hungry. Kyle (as Gerard): Oh, all in? Uh-Spurrier (as Randy): How much you got?Kyle (as Gerard): I got about three hundred left.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. Well, both three hundred. Well ehh…(mumbling) I don’t wanna be a dick. Let’s just go with two.[Goodrich and Ali laugh in the background]Kyle (as Gerard): Okay. Seem overly cocky there, second time rolling.  Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, it’s Joby. He brings out the confidence in me.Kyle (as Gerard): Keep an eye on that Joby, then.Spurrier (as Randy): You definitely should.Kyle (as Gerard): Alright. Well, if you wanna go for it, yeah. You know what, here, I’ll do two hundred. I gotta keep some for myself.Spurrier (as Randy): Absolutely, absolutely.[Multiple dice rolls]Spurrier (as Randy): What did you call?Kyle (as Gerard): I’m gonna call it evens again.Spurrier (as Randy): Evens again? Well, odds again, then.Kyle (as Gerard): Okay, fine. Well-Kyle: -pulls out his cup, he shows a five.Spurrier: Pull it up and show an eight.Kyle (as Gerard): Damn. Alright, alright, alright. That’s fair, that’s fair. I don’t know if I like your game so much as I like my game, but you know what?Spurrier (as Randy): Understandably so.Kyle (as Gerard): You gotta come back, and maybe we’ll have a better time next time for me.  Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. Uh, yeah.Spurrier: So I’ve won an additional two hundred?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: That puts me at five hundred and fifty-three gold.Kyle: And he’s kind of patting his pocket, he’s like-Kyle (as Gerard): Man, glad I had that last gig.Spurrier (as Randy): Seriously, yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Where’d you play?Kyle (as Gerard): Oh, I played up in Koosa. It’s a good place. Family’s kind of at ends with each other, but, you know, it’s just some family rivalry, you know. Mama Koosa wound up actually calling us up there and wanted a little bit of the fifey tricks and treats.Spurrier (as Randy): Ah. Well, duly noted.Goodrich: Mama Koosa? Kyle: Aha, yeah!Goodrich (laughing): Okay yeah, just making sure.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. Well, Gerard, it’s been a pleasure.Kyle (as Gerard): Yeah, I guess. You know, as much of a pleasure as losing some money can be, Randy. Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Gerard): But I’ll get you back.Spurrier (as Randy): Deal.Kyle (as Gerard): Have a good time. Us little folks have to stick together.Spurrier (as Randy): Amen to that.Kyle (as Gerard): Alright. Well, get outta here and let me win some money from these people-Spurrier (as Randy): Stuff my face with 300 gold worth of food. Bye, Gerard.[Ali and Goodrich giggle]Kyle: Gerard was happy to give his money away, apparently.Goodrich: I actually – [dice roll] – if you wanna do me next, I actually, while that was going, I wrote a little something too, a song, you know. Kyle: Okay. Yeah, yeah. You go and perform your song. Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: You get to the point in line for Alto Brown. He calls you up, he’s like-Kyle (as Alto Brown): Alright, next. Next – you know, perform. Tell me what you want.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, Alto. I don’t know if you remember me. It’s Raz’ul.Kyle (as Alto Brown): See a ton of faces every day.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yep, don’t worry about it. Is it cool – I just need to get a little bit for me and a couple of my buddies. Is that cool if I just play one song to get them?Kyle (as Alto Brown): Yes, just perform. There’s people behind you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, yep, yep, yep.Goodrich: So I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Guitar plays, singing tune of “Cheeseburger in Paradise”] Big dinner from Alto Brown, for Chaos Sauce, the best band in town. A few plates of whatever you’ve got around, just need a big dinner from Alto Brown.Ali: Yes.Kyle [as Alto Brown]: Okay, big dinner. Gotcha. Goodrich: [imitates fanfare]Kyle (as Alto Brown): We’ll get it worked out: potatoes, green beans-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Maybe a cheeseburger? Uhhh?Kyle (as Alto Brown): Maybe – okay, you said cheeseburger. Sure, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, thanks.[Music crescendos as transition]Kyle: Alright, Randy. You’re gambling; Raz’ul, you’re getting food. Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And while you two are doing that – Yashee, you head over to the bulletin board, which you look at, and you notice somebody’s crossed out the O on Board, making it say “Bulletin Bard”.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Nice!Kyle: You walk over, and you see there’s some fliers on there. They mention stuff about mattress races that are coming up, to get your team together and everything. There’s also – there’s an opportunity for people, “hey, wanna jam with people outside of your note class? Take this information and we meet up in one of the practice rooms on Saturdays at 2:00 after lunch.” You can come jam with people that you don’t normally jam with. There’s a bardic book club, which, they meet in the library. And you can come chill. You each – you pick a book and you read it, come back next week, talk about it. And mainly focuses on specific bards and bards of repute around the area. There’s also Gerard’s Casino Night, which is gonna be coming up. Goodrich: [laughs] Jeez.Kyle: So if you want to, that’s gonna be, you know, “wear your finest kind of clothing, you come, and we’ll have everything set up. We’ll change over one of the practice rooms into a casino, have a good time. Inquire with Gerard.” There’s also a dance group that’s looking for a backing band to kind of, you know, play the music for something they have planned.Ali: Okay.Kyle: And you also notice there’s a smaller flier. It doesn’t look as official as the others, but it’s called Stargazers. And it’s like, “Hey, just wanna chill and hang out and look at the stars? Contact Tabitha.”  Ali: Oh.Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: So those are all the things you find on the bulletin board-Ali: Cool.Kyle: -which could be ever evolving and new things come up, things happen, things go.Ali: Is there like contact info for the backing band ad?Kyle: Oh yeah. There’s little tabs you can pull for all of them. And they all say, you know, “pull a tab,” and it’ll light up and send a reminder.Ali: Alright. Well, I’m gonna pull one for the jam session, the casino night, the backing band – I’m gonna tell the guys about all those – and then one of the stargazers.Kyle: Okay. Most of the other ones have gotten something pulled from it; you notice you’re the first one to pull something for the Stargazers.Ali: Okay. Well.Kyle: So, alright. You go-Ali: Take Sandy out and-[Goodrich and Spurrier snicker]Goodrich: Oh jeez. Yeah.Ali: -look at the stars with Tabitha.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: It’ll be fun.Kyle: So you all converge back, Raz’ul having gotten a bunch of food for you all. Goodrich: I’m carrying it very expertly, or do I need to roll for it?Kyle: No, you-[Players snicker]Goodrich: And you spill all the food all over the ground. Go back and perform some more.Kyle: Yeah, go and play another song. No, you all get to your table, munch down. And you’re feeling the wear of the travel, and you’re getting tired, especially after eating a big dinner.Goodrich: Sure.Spurrier: Feeling the weight of all the gold in my pockets.[Players laugh]Kyle: Yeah, it’s just weighing you down.Goodrich: Can I actually go and put one of our cards up on the bulletin board?Kyle: Yeah, sure, if you want to. Goodrich: Sweet.Kyle: Go for it.Goodrich: I scribble on there “they dam right” and don’t tell you guys about it.[Players laugh]Kyle: Alright. So you put a – the card is on the board.Goodrich: Got it. Perfect.Ali: Alright. And I’ll share the – especially, like, the casino night, like-Goodrich: Right.Ali (as Yashee): You might be interested in this, uh, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): One step ahead of you. Thank you, though.Ali: And totally the backing band ad for the dance thing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, we can totally do that.Ali (as Yashee): I know you guys like dancing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): This could be really cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I know. I’m down with that if you guys are.Spurrier (as Randy): Yyyah. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Even you, Yashee.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah. I don’t mind watching dancing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. What’s this Stargazer one? Looks pretty cool.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, yeah. You know, I’m interested in-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): -the world out there.[Players giggle in background]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [giggles nervously] I’ve had enough of stars and stuff for a little while, and heavenly bodies crashing to earth. So you have fun with that one. I’m good.Kyle: Okay. Anything else you say to each other before you turn in for the night?Goodrich: Oh, we up in our room now?Kyle: You – after dinner, you would head back to your room. You remember Symbol telling you-Kyle (as Symbol): Be sure to get a good night’s sleep; you gotta get up super early for an ear-training class, like always.Goodrich: [sighs] Oh, yeah. Is it ear-training and sight-singing?Kyle: Yes, it is.Goodrich: Oh boy.Spurrier: Oh, hurray!Goodrich: Alright.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Way to start your day. Alright.Kyle: Yeah, exactly. Bright and early.Goodrich: It’s how I used to start my day.Ali (as Yashee): Better get some – yeah, he said get some good sleep, so let’s hit it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yep.Kyle: Yep.Spurrier (as Randy): Yep.Kyle: Y’all crash for the evening, and I’m gonna go ahead and fast-forward here and say we come back to – you’ve gotten up, you’ve made it to class. And more towards the end of class, your teacher, Mac Dammitt, is-[Goodrich guffaws, Ali and Spurrier snicker]Kyle: -is telling you – he’s a dwarf, a dwarf man – he’s just like-Kyle (as Mac Dammitt): Now remember, you can – you can relate most intervals to something common that you’re, you know, acquainted with. So if you’re having a hard time remembering, like, a perfect fourth, you can remember like a bridal march starts off with that. Or if you need to remember a major sixth, you can remember the National Bardcasting Company has – [Goodrich laughs] – “bum bum bum.”[Piano plays NBC tone]Kyle (as Mac Dammitt): Yeah. So it gives you that perfect sixth to the fourth, which we’ll get to in outlining chords later. But go ahead, and don’t forget to practice your sight-reading using this book here. Come back, and we’ll have our next lesson in a while. But yeah, I think that’s good enough for today. You bards skedaddle on out of here, and your teacher will schedule your next lesson with me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sweet.  Goodrich: Which, it should be mentioned, Mac Dammit is what we used to call our old ear-training software, MacGamut, which was kind of the bane of all of our existence. So-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: -if you’re out there studying music, it’s actually really good for like learning it-Kyle: It is.Goodrich: -but you’ll hate it after. Anyhoo, just a fun fact. Kyle: Yeah. You finish your ear-training, which – you remember after class, you were told, “Yeah, go on to the library and you can get your Wonderball surprise.”Ali: Let’s do it!Goodrich: Let’s go.Spurrier: Yeah, yeah.Kyle: So you get back to the library, and Mr. Read is standing there with a guy who’s wearing more of a mechanic kind of garb, but he also has a big floppy wizard hat. [Goodrich laughs] And he’s just telling Mr. Read, he’s like-Kyle (as Wizard Mechanic): Yeah, so we got it all fixed up, tuned up. You know, we replaced your arcanic capacitor and everything, and so you should be able to, you know, tuck some balls in there and get some items out of them - [Ali snickers] – just proper. But if you have that problem, you call me on back here. You know, the Gold Wizards’ll come and fix it up for you, proper.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So, and he’s just like-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Oh, well, perfect timing, actually.  You bards, come on over, and we’ll get you situated with the Wonderballs again. Thank you, kind sir.Kyle: And the mechanic wizard man leaves. And-Spurrier (as Randy): [tentatively] Didn’t you say you lost the passwords?Kyle (as Mr. Read): Again, something happened. Somebody – we don’t know who – somebody tried to use the machine without knowing how to calibrate it properly.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Splash.Spurrier (as Randy): Did you ask Garreth?Kyle (as Mr. Read): [slowly] No.Spurrier (as Randy): I would – I would ask Garreth.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Okay, I’ll look into it. Garreth. [Players snicker] That’s a start, I guess.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s pretty much a guarantee. But anyways, let’s move on.Kyle (as Mr. Read): A Garreth-tee.Goodrich: Ahh!Kyle (as Mr. Read): Okay. So you will have to redo your passwords, your phrase.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Mr. Read): But that’s okay. You know, it’s easily done. It was just like the last time. You might want to use something different, though. Just saying, just in case something got out there, somebody finds it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Mr. Read): So who wants to pick first, shake-a-shake-a-shake-a-shake-a?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ll go. What the heck.Kyle: Okay. I want you to roll me a D6.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Six.Kyle: Alright. So you pull out this tiny Wonderball wrapped in foil, you unwrap it, and you can see the essence – it looks almost like the essence is making a bag. And on the outside of it is, carved into the metal binding, says “Bag of Tricks.”Goodrich: Ohh!Ali: Hmm.Spurrier: Cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Ah, that should be a good one, yeah. If it’s the one I’m remembering, it should be very – some furry fun. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. Alright, cool.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Who’s next, shake-a-shake-a-shake? Ali (as Yashee): I’ll go.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Alright, Yashee.[dice roll]Ali: [Humming] A three.Kyle: Okay. You reach in, you pull out your ball, pull off the wrapping. And you can see the material inside floats around and looks very porous and sponge-like. And on the side, you see that it reads “Sponge of Holding.”Ali: Okay.Kyle: And Read just says-Kyle (as Mr. Read): I don’t remember that one, but okay. Randy, that leaves you. Shake-a-shake-a-shake ‘em.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool. Let’s shake it up.Kyle: Alright.[dice roll]Spurrier: That is a three.Kyle: Three. You reach in, pull out a ball, unwrap it. It happens to have writing on the side of it, which you don’t know. [Players laugh] But inside, you see swirling – it looks like almost a humanoid shape is swirling in on itself. Spurrier: Oh.Kyle: It’s floating in the middle of this orb. Mr. Read just looks at it and he goes- Kyle (as Mr. Read): Uh, that’s the Viewdoo Doll, I believe?Goodrich: [chuckling] Viewdoo.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, that’s what it says, yeah. Viewdoo.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Well, let’s go set up your passwords and put your balls in there and get you some new items.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sweeeet!Kyle: So you go ahead and you walk into the Dreamforge chamber, and he instructs one by one to go up. Roll your dice for the song that you’re gonna write to make your passphrase. Again, this is gonna be a short thing, just like last time. So let’s go ahead and break, do that, get some songs made.[Music transitions]Kyle: So we’ll do it like we did last time: you each get two dice that you can roll, but in this situation, the machine is generating the chords for you, you’re putting words to it, but, you know.Goodrich: Gotcha. And you get to roll chord dice too, Ali, ‘cause-  Ali: Well, and I think – I don’t think I rolled even drums last time ‘cause I didn’t really have anything to-Goodrich: Oh.Ali: ‘Cause it was like I needed to do some kind of rap-Goodrich: Right.Ali: -so I just had to find like a hip-hop one.Goodrich: Well, cool.Ali: So I will roll drums for this as well.Spurrier: Hurray! Got the bass! Yes, awesome.Ali: Why don’t you go first with your-Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Do it!Ali: -chords.Goodrich: Alright, I’ll go. [Rolls dice] Alright. So it’s C, and then I’m just – I’m gonna say major.Spurrier: I guess you -- major.Goodrich: E minor and F. So C, E minor, and F.Ali: Nice.Spurrier: [Rolls dice] And uh, let’s see here: C, B diminished, and a wild, so let’s try that again. [Rolls dice] [players laugh]Kyle: C and B diminished.Spurrier: Same as last time.Kyle: Alright. That’s, uh-Spurrier: Gonna change my password.Ali: Alright. And then Kyle, you can roll one and I’ll roll one.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Do we need to think major, minor?Kyle: Yeah.Ali: What do you wanna do?Kyle: Oh, oh…Goodrich: Oh, Kyle, oh jeez! Kyle: I guess minor. Minor’s fun.Ali: Alright, let’s do it. [Rolls dice] A minor, E minor, and B diminished.Spurrier: And of course, you can make your E into major if you want.Kyle: That’s true.Ali: Oh, that’s -- alright, alright, alright. Let me roll these drums out.Kyle: Okay.[Coin flip]Ali: Okay, user bank. Fifty-seven is Funk9.Goodrich: Ooh.Kyle: Cool.Ali: So far, so good.Kyle: Cool, cool, cool.Ali: [Rolls dice]  And the kit, Piccolo2?Goodrich: Oh, it probably just means it has a piccolo snare.Spurrier: Or Dragonball. It’s fine.Goodrich: [giggling] Yeah.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Well, either way, I’m very excited.Kyle: The green man.Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Well, on to sectionals. Goodrich: Yeah.[All laugh]Kyle: Listener, we’re about to have our own sectional. Talk to you in a second.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey, everyone, it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle here.

Dang, I wish you could tell me how you’re doing. Well, again, hop on that social media, let us know, and I’ll be glad to answer back. Other than that, let’s hear what these bards came up with. Talk to you later.[Music transitions]Kyle (as Mr. Read): So the Dreamforge is ready to go. Who’s going first?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ll go, I guess. Kyle (as Mr. Read): Okay, Raz’ul.Goodrich: Real quick. [Strums a guitar chord] Okay. So I go up there and I put my ball in there and–[ding]–and I wait for his cue, I guess, right?Kyle: Oh, yeah, he’s – you put the ball in, he’s like-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Wait, wait. Almost. Now. Go.Goodrich: Okay, okay. So I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [singing] I think about what it is I wanna say, when I gotta get a Wonderball in my way. What’s Splash got in store for me today? I don’t know. I hope that it’s good and I’ve found a key to unlock this ball of generosity. Oh, Splash, what have you got for me this time. Oh Spla-ha-ha-sh, what do you have for me? Oh Spla-ha-ha-ash, what do you have for me?Kyle: Okay. The Dreamforge begins to swirl with energy, and as you’re playing, it manifests all of the materials inside the ball into a small bag in the center of it.Goodrich: Huh.Kyle: And in the small bag, you can see that there’s tiny balls; they just look like furballs.     Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: Just like small balls of fur.Kyle: And, uh-Goodrich: Sweet.Ali: Small furry little balls.Kyle: There’s – there’s-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I had one ball, I got more furry balls. Well, dang it.Kyle: There’s a note tucked in there, and you go – you collect your item. And you read the note that says: “Just toss one of these on the ground and you’ll have a furry companion come to life to help you out.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, cool. ‘Cause yeah, I was a little bummed that, like, Yashee got to bring back Sandy, and Randy got to bring back Zil, but [sounding sad] I didn’t get to bring back anybody.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Aww. Well, now that changes. Ali (as Yashee): Aw ho ho.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Now I’ve got lots! Oh boy.Kyle: And I will get you the table of what could be generated from throwing those furballs onto the ground.Goodrich: I throw one on the ground.Kyle: Oh shit. [Players laugh] [Bleep] Alright, roll a D8.Goodrich: Okay. [Rolls dice] Three! Kyle: Three. Okay. So you throw the ball onto the ground, and the ball begins to bubble and grow and – [Goodrich shudders] – kind of oozes out and opens up, and there is a mastiff standing there.Goodrich: Oh, party! Kyle: It’s looking at you-Goodrich: Like a normal size mastiff?Kyle: Normal mastiff.Ali (as Yashee): Sweet!Spurrier (as Randy): Wow.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m gonna name you, uh, Dr. Dog.Ali (as Yashee): Nice. [Players laugh]Kyle: Well, just for your information, Dr. Dog will be available to you until it reaches zero hit points or the next dawn-Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: -and you can also only draw three fuzzballs per day.Goodrich: Okay. Is there an unlimited amount of fuzzballs?Kyle: Unlimited amount of fuzzballs, total, but only three can be drawn in a day.Goodrich: Holy cow.Spurrier: That’s pretty cool.Ali: That’s still pretty sweet.Goodrich: I’m like the master of randomized animal.Ali: Man.Goodrich: Yeah, that’s awesome!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Thanks, Splash!Goodrich: Cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): C’mere, Dr. Dog. [makes kissing sounds] C’mere.Kyle: Dr. Dog comes over.Ali: [makes dog sound][Players laugh]Kyle: And just comes, sits up and looks at you-Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: -tongue hanging out the side.Goodrich: Give him little pets. Yeah, good-Rich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle: Loves it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Guys, check it out. I’ve got a dog!Ali (as Yashee): Aww.Spurrier (as Randy): Aww.Ali (as Yashee): What’s his name?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): His name’s Dr. Dog.Ali (as Yashee): That’s the cutest name ever.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Spurrier (as Randy): M.D. or Ph.D.?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ph.D.Spurrier (as Randy): Ah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t think he practices medicine.[Players laugh]Kyle: Okay, and yeah. The dog comes up over and sits next to you. Read just looks and goes-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Well, that should be fun, I imagine. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I’m psyched.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Let’s get the other two taken care of. Who wants to go next?Ali (as Yashee): I’ll take my turn. Here I go.Kyle: Okay. So you go up, you place your ball in, and – [ding] – Read is looking at you and he says-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Okay, uh, now.[Drums start to play]Ali (as Yashee): [singing] Let’s see what’s in this Wonderball. Roll it out, unwrap my newest haul. The time has come, there’s no need to stall. So yeah, let’s see what’s in this Wonderball. What’s Splash got up his sleeve, [bass guitar riffs] a surprise that I’ll receive, [bass riffs] to use from day to day [bass riffs] as I learn the barding way. [bass riffs] Let’s see what’s in this Wonderball. Roll it out, unwrap my newest haul, for this half-orc, so caring and so tall. Oh yeah, let’s see what’s in this Wonder- Oh, I wonder – in this Wonderball.Goodrich: Man, I want funk pattern.[Players laugh]Kyle: So, again, you begin performing, and much like happened with Raz’ul, the material begins to form and coalesce into a sponge that sits in the middle of the DreamForge, and there’s a little note on top of it. Says, “This is a sponge of holding.”Ali: Mhm.Kyle: “Be careful with this, as you could affect climates and different areas, ‘cause it can suck up and hold about a cubic mile of water.”Goodrich: What?!Spurrier: Whoa.Ali: I could change climate?[Players chuckle]Kyle: No, but-Ali: Oh, it can suck up water?Kyle: Yeah, it’s like a little 2-inch-by-5-inch sponge, like typical kitchen sponge.Ali: Mhm.Kyle: But it has the magical ability to hold mass amounts of water.Goodrich: Then can you release it later?Kyle: You can.Goodrich: [with a deep voice] Release the river!Ali: Just wring it out.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Forever.Ali: Wherever I want.Kyle: Wherever you want.Ali: [Satisfied sigh] Ahh. Alright. Well, that’s awesome.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Yeah. And Read looks over at Randy goes-Kyle (as Mr. Read): Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): Yes?[Goodrich and Ali laugh]Kyle (as Mr. Read): You’re the last one, man.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh yeah, you’re right.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle (as Mr. Read): C’mon over here.Spurrier: So Walk up, give the Dreamforge a longing look.Kyle: Okay. [Players chuckle] And Read says-  Kyle (as Mr. Read): Stop looking at it and put your ball in there.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, right. Okay.Spurrier: And I tuck it in. [ding]Kyle (as Mr. Read): Okay. Get ready. It should – go, now.[Music starts]Spurrier (as Randy): [singing, with an echo] We meet again, my dear Dreamforge, I hope this ball won’t leave you engorged, now it’s time to quaff the sphere, and fill little Randy with joy and cheer.[Players laugh]Ali: That was beautiful.Kyle: Yes. Read’s like-Kyle (as Mr. Read): I’ve never seen anyone love a Dreamforge so much.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. I’ve found in my travels I’m less interested in halflings and finding interest in machines and squids and things.Goodrich: Uhhh.Ali: …and stuffed animals.Kyle (as Mr. Read): Very interesting, Randy.Kyle: But you play. The magic begins to coalesce together into a small doll that sits in the middle of the Dreamforge. And it looks like what we would know to be a voodoo doll, and there’s a note next to it. You don’t know what it says though.Spurrier: True, true.Goodrich: Does Joby get a little jealous?Spurrier: No. They’re gonna be friends.Goodrich: Oh, right. Okay.Spurrier: Well, I’m still choked up from the singing, so-Spurrier (as Randy): Would you guys mind reading this? I’m still a little-Ali: Got tears in your eyes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ferklempt?Spurrier: -kl-klempt. I can’t-Spurrier: It’s streaming down my face.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, give it here.Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you.Kyle: You – Raz’ul, you read it, and it says: “This is a Viewdoo Doll. All you have to do is get a personal belonging or, like, a piece of hair from someone you want to divinate upon.”Goodrich: [whispers] Garreth.Kyle: “And you could – you know, you could spy on them a little bit, once per day. Kinda see what’s going on for about ten minutes.”Goodrich: Is it like see through their eyes?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Ooooh!Spurrier: Cool.Goodrich: Alright. Spurrier: And that’s V-I-E-W-doo?Kyle: Yes, Viewdoo Doll.Spurrier: Viewdoo.Goodrich: Viewdoo.Spurrier: You do.Goodrich: Cool.Spurrier: Alright. Got a little friend for Joby.Goodrich: I tell all you that, that’s cool. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): As long as you let me use it sometimes.Spurrier: [uneasily] Yeah, perv. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’ll let you use my little fuzzballs sometimes.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, cool.Kyle: There you go. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?Goodrich: I throw another one on the ground.Spurrier: And you-Kyle: Roll a D8.Goodrich: Alright. [rolls dice]Ali: Oh, you have two of them.Goodrich: I have three per day. The day’s almost over.Spurrier: You might as well do the other one, too.Goodrich: Okay, I’ll do the other one. [Rolls dice] I got-Kyle: It’s a little bit after the morning class. What are you talking about?Spurrier: You have a full day of friends.Goodrich: Oh well. I rolled a five and a one.Kyle: Five and a one. The first one you throw out balloons up and bubbles up over and reveals a giant goat. [Players laugh]Goodrich: How giant is giant?Kyle: Uh, it’s large. Like-Goodrich: Like, when it walks over, people are like “That’s a massive goat!”Kyle: Yeah, it’s a bigger-than-normal goat.Goodrich: Okay, okay. [to himself, as if writing] Giant-Kyle: Yes. And then the third one is just a rat.Goodrich: A rat.Kyle: Just a normal rat. Nothing special about it, other than it came out of a small fuzzball.Goodrich: And it knows kung fu, maybe?Kyle: Maybe.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: I don’t know. Maybe he’ll have some turtle buddies. We’ll have to see.Goodrich: Okay, cool.Kyle: Right now, I don’t think that’ll happen with this.Ali: Oh, you can speak to animals too, so this is just – this is gonna be fun.Goodrich: Heck yeah. Read my mind. So speaking of that, for all intents and purposes, they’re normal animals but they just disappear at the end of the day? Or-Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: I was just making sure that, like, they’re not some phantasmal-Kyle: No.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Not phantasmal.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Alright. So that’s gonna give you all your wonder toys and everything like that, so, you know what? I think that’s a good place to wrap it up, you each getting your own little treat. We’ll pick up next time in the same place.Goodrich: Same bard time, same bard channel.Kyle: That’s right. So thanks again for dropping by and listening. Catch you in two weeks.[Theme music plays]"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-22-getting-schooled-mvt-v,"Ep. 22 - Getting Schooled, Mvt. V","Ep. 22 - Getting Schooled, Mvt. V[Over a simple backbeat, a “hey” sound effect is played on the keyboard at various pitches. In the middle, Goodrich starts giggling, and on one beat toward the end yells “huh!”][Theme music plays]Kyle: Hey everybody, welcome back to BomBARDed. Let me recap last episode real quick. We started with the bards discussing the airship and the large bird that came to its aid. Raz’ul revealed the large bird is actually his druid mentor Reed, and Symbol seemed as though he didn’t seem to see the large bird, but did inform the bards that the ship is a royal vessel from the Ionian province of Alcan and that they must be here in preparation for the Bicentennial. The bards continued on to school and arrived safely; no mishaps or anything like that during travel. When you got to school, Symbol seemed preoccupied with something he brought home with him, his little treats.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Hmmm.Goodrich: Classic Splash.Kyle: Sneak those off. I let the bards know that they had the evening off to rest and relax, but they did have an ear-training course in the morning that they should attend, and to see Mr. Read in the library after that class. In regular fashion, the bards didn’t listen and tried to go to the library immediately [players laugh], but in doing so, came across Tabitha and Ms. McDade who appeared to have run into each other, as they were picking up each other’s dropped effects. Goodrich: Whomp.Kyle: Tabitha caught up with our bards a little bit after McDade scurried off, but this was eventually interrupted by Garreth and Ilda, who were looking for Tabitha because she was late to band practice. After a short back-and-forth between them and our bards, Tabitha left with Garreth and Ilda for practice, and the bards made their way to the nurse about Randy’s tattoo.Goodrich: I was just gonna say, we don’t know anything about being late to band practice, do we? [Players laugh]Kyle: I definitely do. I know I’m – [players continue laughing] – if anybody’s late, it’s gonna be me. But that’s where you met Nurse Odejoy, and she wound up giving you actually a little bit of a fetch quest to help procure some items that would help her cast a spell, maybe to give a little bit of insight into what’s going on with Randy’s back tat.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: So afterwards, you went to the library, but you found out that the Dreamforge was under repair at the moment, so you decided to go out to dinner. This is where you got into some gambling business, got into some food-ordering business. Yashee checked out the bulletin board and you found out about some events.Goodrich: Bulletin bard.Kyle: Bulletin bard, that’s right.Goodrich: Uahh! [Players laugh]Kyle: But after that, you just went back to your rooms, went to bed, woke up early, and had your ear-training class.Ali: We’re good students.Goodrich: That’s right, Kyle.Ali: We’re not staying up all night partying or anything.Kyle: No, no, that doesn’t happen in music school.Ali: That’s not us.Goodrich: Speaking of which, we got a whole episode ahead of us.[Players laugh]Kyle: So – but you had your early-morning class of ear training with Mac Dammit, and went to the lie-berry [sic] – [players giggle] -- where you used the Dreamforge. And you found out it was up and running – they had gotten it fixed – and – but the problem with that is that you had to redo your password songs. And you did them. You ended up receiving some items, which you three wrote down, right?Goodrich: Yup.Ali: Yeah.Spurrier: Yes.Goodrich: Fuzzballs.Spurrier: Got the Viewdoo Doll.Kyle: Yes, the Viewdoo Doll.Ali: I got the Sponge of Holding.Kyle: Sponge of Holding.Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: Which I believe I heard that on the DM’s Blog podcast a long time ago, if I’m not mistaken. Just gotta give credit where credit’s due.Goodrich: A cubic mile of water is insane.Spurrier: So much water.Goodrich: So much water.Kyle: Yeah, you’ll-Spurrier: Trillions of gallons.Ali: Talk about partying.[Players cheer]Goodrich: Yashee makes it rain on everybody!Ali: “Yashee brought her sponge!”Kyle: Yeah. I mean, it said water, but you don’t know if it, like, maybe works for other liquids.Goodrich: Oh my gosh, a cubic mile of hooch! Oh – talk about making a dry town wet![Overlapping talk and laughter]Kyle (as two different characters in conversation): “Can you fill my flask?” “Can I?”[Players chuckle some more]Kyle: Alright, so that catches us up. And at this point, it’s about midday, you know, close to lunch. You mill around the school for a little while, and eventually-Goodrich: I have my pets with me, I guess.Kyle: Yeah, you have your pets with you.Ali: Oh yeah. [laughs]Kyle: You’re just walking around-Goodrich: Which, I did want to say, I named the other two as well. I named the goat Michael Jordan, because the goat.Kyle: Greatest of all time, yes.Goodrich: Yeah, the greatest of all time. So also, I wanted to ask you guys, for the rat, I was gonna name him either Ratsputin or Bo, so it’d be Bo Rat.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Bo Rat! [Laughs]Kyle: You could just name him Rattigan from The Great Mouse Detective. Goodrich: That’s what I was thinking too. So what do you guys want to name the rat?  Spurrier: I mean, he’s your rat.Goodrich: But he’s kind of our rat too. I mean-Spurrier: Yeah, I mean, I s’pose so.Kyle: Scabbers?Goodrich: Scabbers? No, because Scabbers is like a person.Kyle: I know.Goodrich: I’m just gonna go with Bo Rat. Just like call him Bo.Spurrier: Okay.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So that’s your little fuzzy animals’ names.Goodrich: And they’re, I guess, just following us around the school as we walk.Kyle: Yeah, they’re just following you around.Goodrich: Sweet.Kyle: People are kinda giving you odd looks a little bit, but at the same time, they’re tame. They’re doing exactly what you say and-Goodrich: It’s a bard school.Kyle: -they don’t seem to be getting out of hand, so – real no issue.Spurrier: I mean, we’ve ridden a horse around the school before. It’s fine.Kyle: That’s true. That’s true. But as you’re going through your day, you suddenly get hit up by Symbol, who rings you up on your Ira Glass and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Hey, hey, how about you come up to the practice rooms. We’re gonna cover a new thing. I got something musical to teach you.Goodricch (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Symbol): You know, it’s the last day of the week, let’s finish it up with a bang. You’ve got the bed races tomorrow. Are y’all doing that?Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, yeah, I guess. Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): We should. Kyle (as Symbol): Sweet, sweet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Participate in school activities, that’s a good thing.Spurrier (as Randy): School spirit, ra ra. [Goodrich laughs] FIGHT WIN BARDS!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Chaos Sauce has so much school spirit, Splash. Didn’t you know?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, that’s right. And it’s Symbol. Okay. Well, yeah. Come meet me.Kyle: And you know where the practice rooms are.Goodrich: Yep.Ali: Mhm.Kyle: You head there. Symbol’s waiting for you, and says-Kyle (as Symbol): C’mon in. Have a seat. Let’s, uh- Goodrich: I tell all the animals to sit.Kyle: They all sit.Goodrich: Awesome!Kyle: Perfectly. They’re very well-behaved.Goodrich: Huh!Kyle: And Symbol points at the animals and says-Kyle (as Symbol): Ah, I see you got the Rust Bag of Tricks, huh?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup.Kyle (as Symbol): So you’ve got a mastiff-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s Dr. Dog.Kyle (as Symbol): -a goat-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s Michael Jordan.Kyle (as Symbol): Alright. And you’ve got your rat.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bo.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. Well, let me tell you about the other things that you can have in there. You can only do three per day, if I’m not mistaken. You got an owl in there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Symbol): You have a giant goat. Wait-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s what I have.Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, then there’s a regular goat too.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay. Gotcha.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Couldn’t you tell? It’s massive.Kyle (as Symbol): A giant boar.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup.Kyle (as Symbol): A lion!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): A lion?!Ali (as Yashee): What?Kyle (as Symbol): So a lion, and then a brown bear.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Party.Kyle (as Symbol): So you throw those and they come out at random. You know, fun little animal thing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): I figured since, with your background, it’d be appropriate.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Appreciate it, ‘cause I’m already having a blast. Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.Goodrich: And I pet all three of them.Kyle: They all three love it.Goodrich: Yeah! Man, this is – uh. I love BomBARDed now.[Everyone laughs]Spurrier: Up till this point-Ali: Yeah, yeah.Kyle: Symbol says-Kyle (as Symbol): What did you two get? You got a – Yashee?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, I got a sponge. Let me show you.Ali: And I take it out-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Careful.Ali: -and I’m about to start wringing it. Anyone?Kyle: Nothing comes out of it – [overlapping conversation] – because there’s nothing in it yet.Ali (as Yashee): It’s dry right now, but, you know, not for long.Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, be careful with that. That’s, uh – honestly, when I thought it up, I thought maybe this is a little too much. But at the same time, it’s pretty cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): So-Ali (as Yashee): Thanks for trusting me with such a sponge.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, no problem.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, can you put stuff other than water in it? Do you know, Splash?Kyle (as Symbol): [hesitantly] I … haven’t tried.Goodrich: You got anything on you we could try? Uhh-Ali (as Yashee): Or everybody spit. Ready?[Kyle laughs, someone else makes preparatory spitting sounds]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Welcome to- [Spitting sounds finish] Soaks it up? Awesome. Splash, is – you wanna?Kyle (as Symbol): No.Ali: And I wring it right out onto the ground.Ali (as Yashee): It’s gross. I don’t want it in my pocket.Kyle (as Symbol): It’s okay. Any of the horn players spit on the ground, so-[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): So Randy, what did you wind up getting?Spurrier (as Randy): I got a doll, the Viewdoo Doll.Kyle (as Symbol): Viewdoo Doll. Oh, excellent. Okay, uh-Spurrier (as Randy): And –be friends with Joby.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, absolutely. That’s great. Well, for that, if you get a personal effect of somebody or, you know, something to represent a person, you can pretty much attach that to the doll and you’ll be able to, like, spy on them for about ten minutes. The material component of that will dissipate after it’s used, so have a lot if you’re gonna use it on one person. And probably only use it maybe once per day before the magic has to regenerate. Spurrier (as Randy): Does it have to be a physical thing from them, or could it be like a picture, a piece of paper that was written on by them? Or does it have to be part of their body?Kyle (as Symbol): If it’s something they’ve written, I think that would work. I don’t think a picture of them would necessarily work, but definitely something from their body.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. That’s the safest bet.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, absolutely.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool.Kyle (as Symbol): So okay, cool. Well, that’s not why we’re here, but I’m glad you enjoyed your gifts.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): So let’s talk about rhythm. Yashee?Ali (as Yashee): Yes?Kyle (as Symbol): You keep the rhythm in this group.Ali (as Yashee): I try.Spurrier (as Randy): And how.Kyle (as Symbol): I’ve heard you do many different things. You’ve put some swing into things, and-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): You’ve been playing mainly in 4/4. I think there’s some things you’ve adapted into more of a triple feel.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): So yeah. So I just wanna talk to you about, you know, different meters: simple meters, complex meters, compound meters, duple and triple and everything. And that’s whether you’re feeling it in twos or threes or fours, or quadruple-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Or fives.  Kyle (as Symbol): You’ve got it in fives as well. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ohh!Kyle (as Symbol): And that’s when you get into the complex, which you can either feel that in a phrasing of three-and-two or two-and-three. So there’s just a number of ways you can approach song composition, and these different metric methods will really open up your compositional style.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): So, uh, I tell you what. Let’s get into the meat of this. Let’s just learn by doing – I believe in experiential learning. So-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [chuckling] Clearly.Spurrier (as Randy): I was gonna say. Oh man.[Ali giggles]Kyle (as Symbol): Hey, you live life, you learn life.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You almost die. You know…Spurrier (as Randy): Then you really live.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Then you really live.Kyle (as Symbol): But you’re not dead.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, you got me there.Kyle (as Symbol): Exactly. So I tell you what. I’ve got my dice here, the chord dice we used for the – for Yashee’s last song when we were on the carriage-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): So why don’t we roll these – we’ve got our chords – and we can talk about what kind of feel you want to put to the song that’s not 4/4. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Hmm.Kyle (as Symbol): So that’s the only stipulation: no 4/4, no simple quadruple meter. Something different.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Cool. Spurrier (as Randy): Alright.Kyle (as Symbol): Y’all excited?Goodrich and Spurrier (as Raz’ul and Randy): [in unison) Yes.Kyle (as Symbol): I am too. Let’s have some fun.Goodrich: Alright![Music transitions]Kyle: Alright. So it’s time for a little bit of ear training for you listeners-Goodrich: Yay!Kyle: -as we correlate some of these ideas to songs you may know. Let’s start off – I mean, listeners, you know we’ve played in 4/4, so-Goodrich: Right. Well, and it should be mentioned too that when we talk about meters and time signatures and stuff, this is like the beat of the song, so what you’re counting in when you count a song. So yeah, like Kyle’s saying, 4/4, everything we’ve done up to this point. [Piano begins to play] 1, 2, 3, 4, [counting along with the beat] 1-2, 1-2-3-4, 1- and so on. But yeah. Everything we’ve done has been in 4/4, so-Kyle: Yeah. We’ve done some songs, like we mentioned just a second ago, where we’ve felt them in a different feel.Goodrich: But we’ll get to that.Kyle: Yeah, we’ll get to that. Spurrier, where do you wanna start off with this ol’ meter stuff?Spurrier: Why don’t we go backwards and we’ll start with 3.Kyle: Alright. Take a step back.Spurrier: We’ll take one away, yeah. Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: For you Zelda fans out there, we’ve got the lullaby, the- [plays melody on piano] – Goodrich: [counting along with the melody] 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1.Spurrier: And so on.Goodrich: So on and so forth. Pretty much any waltz. You know, and-Ali: Anything you can kinda sway to.Goodrich: Right.Spurrier: Yeah. We’ve also got another little dance, got a minuet here. [plays melody]Goodrich: 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, yup.Spurrier: And just for those of you playing at home, this is not by Bach. It’s by a dude called Christian Petzold. [Goodrich chuckles] For hundreds of years we thought it was Bach, but we got it figured out, so we need to give him credit. So-Goodrich: Splash is also teaching us music history.Spurrier: That’s right, about these fictional real people.[Players laugh]Kyle: Trans-dimensional music history.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: Would've been a fun topic. Anyways-Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: And then finally, for you Game of Thrones fans, you got the – [plays melody] –Goodrich: 1-, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, yup.Spurrier: Yeah. And so on and so on. So yeah.Goodrich: Yup.Kyle: YeahSpurrier: So there’s 3.Goodrich: There’s also 6/8, which is like kinda felt in 3. If you remember, like we had mentioned, we kinda, you know, kinda squeezed that in there that the “Randy, Raz’ul, and I” song is in 4 but you feel the triplet, so that it kind of feels like it’s in 6/8.Spurrier: This is like your [plays note on the piano to mark beat] – instead of going – [adds a higher note, playing two notes per beat] – feeling two notes for every – [adds a third note per beat] – you’re feeling things in threes.Goodrich: [Singing] Randy, Raz’ul, and I-[Someone marks the rhythm with “ch” sounds]Spurrier: 1-2-3-1-2-3, 1-2-3-1-2-3-Goodrich: [singing] Yes, we did.Spurrier: And so on and so on.Goodrich: That’s right.Spurrier: It’s great. Which is how, yeah, we can kinda tie that in. We’re – again, if this is our [plays note while counting] 1-2-3-4-5-6, we can do [changes accent using a lower note] 1-2-3 or 1-2-3, 4-5-6. Overall, the speed’s the same, we’re just feeling it differently. Goodrich: Yeah. So-Spurrier: Yeah. That’s what music’s all about. Goodrich: How you feel.Kyle: It’s all about the feel.Spurrier: That’s right. And then, so to actually hear a song in 6/8, we got the classic “My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.” And a lot of these kind of ship songs have the rocking back and forth.Goodrich: Right.[Spurrier plays tune]  Goodrich: 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6, 1-2-3-4-5-6.Spurrier: And so on. Goodrich: Yeah, any sort of sea shanty and all that, those are usually in 6/8.[Everyone giggles]Kyle: Assassin’s Creed Black Flag. Just basically all that. Okay, so let’s talk about some fun meter like 5/4.Goodrich: Yes.Spurrier: Yeah. And you usually – you could go 1-2-3-4-5, but it feels kinda awkward, so we usually either feel it in 3+2 or 2+3. So a classic example is the jazz standard “Take Five.” [Plays melody]Goodrich: 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5. [Someone sings along, imitating a trumpet] There ya go, yeah. Yeah. Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: And then, of course, there’s the Mission: Impossible theme is in 5, so-Kyle: Yeah.[Melody on piano]Goodrich and Spurrier: 1-2-3-4-5, 1-2-3-4-5, [imitate trumpet sound together, then all laugh]Goodrich: So, but then, lastly – and we don’t have this in the drum machine, but there is 7/4.Spurrier: Yes.Goodrich: Right. We were talking about maybe programming it in there, so we’ll see. Kyle: Figuring out something.Spurrier: Yeah, down the line. Goodrich: But yeah, there’s 7/4. So that’s – it’s the same sort of deal but just seven beats. So there’s – Spurrier, you were talking about the Minecraft tune?Spurrier: Yeah, for all you children out there that like to build – [plays melody].Spurrier and Ali: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7.Spurrier: 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4. 1-2-Kyle: Alright, let’s stop recording and go play Minecraft.Goodrich: [laughing] Oh, yeah, for real! Kyle: Now I’m jonesing.Goodrich: Jonesin’!Kyle: Of course, then, there’s Pink Floyd’s “Money.” [Plays tune on the bass]Goodrich: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. “Money!” Yeah, “Money!” But yeah. And then the last thing was just doing something in four but feeling it in a weird way so that it’s...Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Radiohead is really good at doing this. So you got – [plays piano]. 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4, 1- and so on and so on.Goodrich: Yeah, so-Spurrier: It sounds like it’s in some bizarre time signature, but it’s really just in 4.Kyle: Depends on the em-phasis.Spurrier: Exactly.Goodrich: Right. On the right sy-llable.Spurrier: Ugh.Kyle: But now, what that means for our bards in game and how we actually choose music, I think we’ll break it down into whether you’re choosing to do, you know, in 5 or in triple or in duple. So what are we gonna do this song in?Goodrich: Right.Kyle: You can’t do it in 4/4, so-Goodrich: Well, then also, we had talked about the mechanics for rolling.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: In Pat, in the drum machine, there is only ten different selections that are in a triple meter – so ¾ or 6/8, and then only five in that are in a 5.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So we’ll just roll a D10 for either one of those, and pick them out.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: But yeah. I don’t know. Do you guys – I mean, 3, maybe? That’s a pretty easy one. We haven’t done anything in 3.Spurrier: I mean-Ali: We haven’t.Kyle: There are three of you. Spurrier: I mean, we did feel that one song in 3. I don’t know. It would be kinda cool to do one in 5.[Goodrich sighs dramatically]Ali: I’d be down to try one in 5.Goodrich: Let’s do 5.Kyle: Let’s do it!Goodrich: [resignedly] Let’s do 5.Ali: Okay. D10, here we go. [Rolls dice] It landed on three, so that’s gonna be a Jazz4. Goodrich: Oh good. Well, at least we have that. And then, we’re still going to roll for the sound of the kit, ‘cause that doesn’t really change.Kyle: Yeah, that’s not gonna change.Goodrich: Any sort of kit can play in any meter.Ali: Alright. So the [rolls dice] kit is going to be fifty-nine.Goodrich: I mean, if that’s a jazz kit, this’ll just be the best.Spurrier: It’s the jazziest ever.Ali: It’s a Rock6.Goodrich: Well, we’re close enough. Yeah. That’s awesome. We can actually do like a legit kind of jazz tune.Spurrier: Imagine that.Goodrich: That’s exciting! In 5.Kyle: Alright. So let’s roll the chord dice.Goodrich: Yep. So major or minor?Kyle: You tell me.Goodrich: Kinda wanna do minor, but that’s only because “Take Five” is minor. [whines]Spurrier: I mean, we did come back from a pretty crazy adventure.Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: We can be sad to Symbol.[Players chuckle]Ali: Yeah.Goodrich: Let’s do minor.Spurrier: It’s been a while.[Dice roll]Goodrich: C, two F’s, and an A minor.Kyle: Awesome.Spurrier: And lots of 7th chords.Goodrich: [laughing] I was about to say, ‘cause that’s pretty ambiguous.Spurrier: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay!Kyle: Cool.Goodrich: Sweet!Kyle: Get to writing.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone.

Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): A little tricky, but I think we came up with something for you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, what have you got?[Jazzy music starts with drums and piano, later joined by guitar]Goodrich, Ali and Spurrier: [Singing] Wandering through the world for so many miles and miles and miles and miles, there’s no home on the road, weary eyes and heavy loads, but here we are in verse and song to find a place where we belong. [Brief guitar solo] Now as one, all the things we’ve done, feels like miles and miles and miles and miles. There’s a home all our own for weary eyes and heavy loads, and here we are in verse and song, we’ve found a place where we belong.Kyle (as Symbol): Well, I think that was a superb performance. You did a good mixing of three-and-two and then two-and-three to really define the different sections that you were playing.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, it was a little – I don’t know, we were – it’s been quite a few days. [Ali laughs]Kyle (as Symbol): That’s understandable.Goodrich: For me too, anyways. I don’t know if you want to have this talk now or whatnot, but you know, the whole – we almost died out there.Ali (as Yashee): That’s right. A couple times.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): A couple times. Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): It’s-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Kinda nice to be back in school, I think is what all of us mean by that. Sigh.Kyle (as Symbol): It’s nice to be within the safety of the walls of Strumlotts, yes, but you’re not gonna find any fame, fortune, information, or any glorious historical discoveries-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh.Kyle (as Symbol): -inside the walls of a school. You’ve gotta take the chance-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Eh.Kyle (as Symbol): -roll the dice. Right, Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): It’s true.Goodrich: How do you know that, what the heck?Spurrier (as Randy): Won’t find any dead fish or any sweet sandatees.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, that’s true.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): We found all of them out there on the road. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [in a distant voice] I guess you could say we found ourselves.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): That’s fair. Your words – I have to say, the words speak to me. It’s hard not feeling like you have a home. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Especially when you’ve been away from yours for so long. Um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But enough about that. Thanks, Splash. [Laughs]Kyle (as Symbol): No problem.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do we get an A on that song?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, you get an A.[Ali giggles]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sweet.  Kyle (as Symbol): You get an A on the song. Good job. But, you know, be sure to employ those compositional techniques going forward at your whim; you know what to do regarding them. And if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Of course, that’s what I’m here for.Spurrier (as Randy): Splash, do you know if the different times affect the magical potency of our songs or will have any impact on that or- Kyle (as Symbol): I wouldn’t say necessarily. Again, it’s the words compounded with the music that you’re playing that direct the magic. So, again, words mean a lot, and as I was saying, I really related to your song. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Having and finding a home is nice, and maybe someday you’ll get to return to yours. I wish I could mine.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t mind staying here either.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah. This is our home for the time being. We all have got each other, and we got you too, Splash.Goodrich: Awww! I go over and give Splash a big hug!Kyle: He opens his arms wide for all of you.Goodrich: Aww, yes!Ali: Alright, bring it in!Spurrier: Jump on in there.Goodrich: Okay. And then while I do, can I do a stealth check to grab some hair off of-Spurrier: Well, that’s what I was gonna do, and I might be a little more successful than you at that.Kyle: Go for it.Spurrier: Gotta use my Viewdoo Doll.Goodrich: And I guess, in that case, can I roll to see if I notice Randy doing that?Kyle: Sure.Goodrich: Okay, cool.[Dice rolls]Spurrier: That is a thirteen plus six.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I got a twelve plus five, seventeen.Kyle: Okay. You don’t notice Randy doing it. Symbol, however, does. As you go to pull some strands of hair, and you wind up getting a little bit bigger of a chunk than you had bargained for. And you hear him audibly go-Kyle (as Symbol): Ow! What the – oh, Randy!Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, sorry, you have an enticing scent.Kyle: He holds out his hand, he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Give me my hair back.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Spurrier: And I do, but then I do another sleight-of-hand to just try to pocket one.Kyle: He’s watching you real closely, so do it at a disadvantage. Spurrier: Alright, cool. [Rolls dice]Kyle: He’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): I know what I just gave you.Spurrier: Okay. That’s a fourteen plus six, that is [rolls dice] a nine plus six, so a fifteen. [Goodrich laughs]Kyle: He says-Kyle (as Symbol): No, Randy, all the hair.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh. I was gonna put it in the potpourri later, but fine.Kyle (as Symbol): Hahahaha.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, I mean, I was, but alright. Here you go.Kyle (as Symbol): Sure, okay. I know what – I know what I just gave you, we just talked about it.Spurrier (as Randy): Well-Kyle (as Symbol): The Viewdoo Doll. Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Is this where we’re at, Randy? Are we here now?Spurrier (as Randy): Well, we are here. I mean, look around. We’re home.Kyle: And he just looks at you with a look of disappointment and kinda shakes his head, takes the hair. He’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Y’all get out of here. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aww.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye, Splash.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think he just slipped, Splash. He was – you know, he was climbing up to give you a big ol’ hug.Kyle (as Symbol): Mhm, sure.Goodrich: Keep that in mind next time.Kyle (as Symbol): Get outta here. Go rest up for the bed race tomorrow.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye, Splash.Spurrier (as Randy): I’ll miss your enticing scent.Kyle (as Symbol): I’m sure you will, Randy. Spurrier: And I waft-Kyle (as Symbol): Y’all have a good night, I guess.Kyle: And he’s just kind of like standing there, rubbing the back of his head – [players laugh] – and shaking his head like – you hear him mouth like, “What the…”Goodrich: Yeah, okay.[Players chuckle]Kyle: So-Goodrich: So I go over to Randy and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Did you try to get some of his hair?Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Did you get to – did you really give him all of it – back?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. I tried to-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): – to slip a little.Goodrich: Well, hey. What would you say, later, you know, I bet-Goodrich: Do we know where Splash, like, stays and stuff? Kyle: No, you don’t really.Goodrich: Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, maybe later we can find Splash and try that again. ‘Cause we don’t need like a hair, per se. We just need like a possession.Spurrier (as Randy): I might be better, like, being on lookout and you actually doing it this time around.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Because I think I’ve-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [laughs] Yeah, okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee, you can come too, I guess, but... Ali (as Yashee): I don’t even know if I wanna.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Sounds – what are you guys doing?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, okay. Can I talk to you guys, like, for real, just for a sec?Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, probably.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Um, so, like I said before, that whole thing in the cave-Spurrier (as Randy): That whole experience. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I almost died. I’m still kinda coming to terms with that. I just – I kinda wanna just see what Splash is gonna do with that flask, and I kinda wanna know more about, like, missions and what he’s doing. So…Ali (as Yashee): So, you saying you don’t think he gave the flask to John from BOI?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, I mean, I don’t know. Like, it’s – [sigh] – he just keeps kinda brushing off the fact that we wound up in this crazy cave, almost dying, with crazy brain squids and junk. Like, yeah, it’s great experience, but also, baby steps, you know? I mean, I don’t know, I just wanna – I don’t know. I’m kinda curious as to what he does all day.Ali (as Yashee): I mean, you’re making sense.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): But I don’t think I wanna go down that path with you guys.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s fair. Alright. Well…Spurrier (as Randy): Again, I’ll play the back roll on this one.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): I already – yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. That’s fair. So just – I’ll keep an eye out for it. You know, if the opportunity arises, I’ll let you know. But, I don’t know. For me, anyways, I’m a little curious as to what Splash gets up to when he’s not around, [sounds very sad] teaching us about 5/4 and stuff.Ali (as Yashee): Well, while you’re there, see if you can find out what the snacks are, ‘cause I – I’m still pretty curious about those. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Happy again] Yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s my definite number two, for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: That’s it.Kyle: Okay, cool. Well then, you have a pretty normal night again, and it’s the next day. Everyone’s getting prepped – it’s like, you know – it’s like the first day of the weekend.Goodrich: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: I don’t want to say Saturday, but it’s like a Saturday.Goodrich: Yeah. Bust out the weekend potpourri feature. Kyle: Exactly. So you all get ready to go down to the bed races-Ali: Get in our best racing pajamas.Kyle: Y’all still wanted to do the bed races, right?Goodrich: Oh yeah.Ali: Yeah.Spurrier: Yep, yep.Kyle: Cool. Well then, you make your way to there. You and a large grouping of students and faculty are gathered on one of the many rolling green hills that surround Strumlotts. You’ve been enjoying the festivities of the event – food, drinks, smaller games of chance that will reward you with small baubles and knickknacks. Alto Brown is grilling out a smorgasBARD of delights – [players laugh] – and everyone is hyped about the prizes for the bed race winners.Goodrich: Cool.Kyle: The winning group of each class is gonna be rewarded with a free two-night stay at – well, let’s just say it’s Link’s favorite hotel, the Hyaat. Goodrich: Hyaat.[Players laugh]Kyle: No, instead, let’s say it’s the Critz-Carlton.Spurrier: So you should get twenty nights free instead of two.[Players agree enthusiastically]Kyle: So yeah. But you’ll get a free two-night stay at the Critz-Carlton during the upcoming Bicentennial celebration.Goodrich: Ooh.Kyle: Yashee and Raz’ul, you’re cheering on Randy as he squirms his way through a gauntlet of sorts, not unlike something you would see on MXC. [Ripple of chuckles] All of a sudden, you hear your names bellowed over the crowd, along with the others that are in your class of freshies. Randy, it distracts you for a moment, and I want you to give me a dexterity save.Spurrier: Oh boy. Alright.Goodrich: On the rotating surfboard of doom.Kyle: Yeah, you’re on the last leg of this, the very end.   Spurrier: Aww, man.Ali (as Yashee): C’mon, Randy![Dice rolls]Kyle: See if you finish it up or fall.Spurrier: So that is a twelve plus four.Kyle: Alright. That gets it! You clear over the last obstacle, hit the red buzzer, and bam. So it’s like MXC and Ninja Warrior combined now.Goodrich: Right.Spurrier: Most Extreme Ninja Warrior. Awesome. Or Most Extreme Randy.Kyle: Yeah, Most Extreme Randy. [Everyone laughs] So, but all the names are called out for the people in your class, and you hear-Kyle (as announcer): All of you, get to the starting line for your class race.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle: Do you make your way to the starting line?Ali: Yeah.Spurrier: Yes.Goodrich: Yeah. We didn’t bring a bed though, but maybe they provided one?Kyle: Yeah. You know that the beds are there.Goodrich: Oh, okay. Sweet.Kyle: You’ll be good. So you arrive at the starting line and see the other three note classes waiting and picking who is going to perform the different jobs in this race, when a portly human man with a clipboard comes over wearing mid-thigh black shorts, a blue shirt with cut-off sleeves, and a red sweatband that clings tightly around a bald head with a horseshoe hairline. He looks at all of you and says-Kyle (as Kage): Listen up, freshie pukes. The name’s Kage: [someone snickers] – practice room operator, event coordinator, and interim janitor till I can find the last janitor’s replacement. I’ve got one thing to say: It’s all fun and games until someone gets hurt. So I don’t wanna see any hits below the belt – defenders, looking at you –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ohh!Kyle (as Kage): Drivers and pushers, stay in your lane. You try and crash into another team, you’re outta here. Understand?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Kyle (as Kage): Oh, we got a wise – [players laugh] – we got a wiseman over here, everyone. So what don't you understand about that, sir?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [in a monotone] Like, any of this. I’ve never done a bed race before.Kyle (as Kage): You get on the bed, you’re race it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. [Ali giggles] Does it have an engine? Like someone pushes it, I guess?Kyle (as Kage: Yeah. You got a pusher, you got a defender, and you got a driver.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay.Spurrier (as Randy): The defender-  Kyle (as Kage): You’ve not been watching the other people racing all day?Goodrich and Ali (as Raz’ul and Yashee): No.Kyle (as Kage): What have y’all been doing?Spurrier (as Randy): I’ve been becoming the Most Extreme Randy, so they were busy watching me.Kyle: He shakes his head. He says-Kyle (as Kage): Alright. Enough of this, you’ll get the picture. Okay.[Someone snickers]Ali (as Yashee): Alright.Kyle (as Kage): So first up, Chaos Sauce, bed 1.Kyle: And he points over there. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): We’re number one! We’re Number one!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’re number one!Kyle (as Kage): Yeah, we’ll see about that. The North Stars, bed 2. Radiant Dissonance, bed 3. The Golden Meanies, bed 4. Racers, to your beds, pick your roles, and, uh, let me know when you’re ready.Spurrier: And so, do we know, from just stuff about bed races, what the defender does? Kyle: Yeah. I will actually explain it now.Spurrier: [snickers] Cool.Goodrich: Don’t be so mean about it, Kyle! Just tell us what we need to do! Kyle!Kyle: It wasn’t me, it’s Kage. Alright. So pretty much here’s the roles that you can play: there’s the pusher, who – the pusher will make strength checks to determine the place. No specific DC is set for this; we’re just gonna calculate the total number that the pusher gets at the end.Goodrich: A dirty drug pusher. [Others giggle]Kyle: Yep, exactly. That’s what it is.Kyle: So there’s also the driver, which, you’ll be making dexterity checks throughout the process to ensure that you don’t hit any obstacles. And then there’s the defender, who can defend against oncoming obstacles or obstacles that are redirected towards them.Spurrier: Hmmm.Kyle: So just to make this easier for you three, I’m actually going to pass this around so you can read it, and then we will let you pick your roles. [Paper rustles][Music transitions]Kyle: Alright. So you all know what the different positions are: defender, pusher, and driver. So who’s gonna do what?Ali: Uh, Yashee will be the pusher.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: Randy will be the driver.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: I’ll be the dru – I mean, defender. [Players laugh]Kyle: You can be both, I guess, in that situation.Goodrich: I know. [Grumbles incoherently] But before we go, I’m gonna throw out two of my little fuzzballs.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: And, uh, I definitely, like, turn my hat backwards. [Laughs]Kyle: All of a sudden you have a hat on.Goodrich: Yeah. And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Go, fuzzy ball! [imitates a sound effect][Spurrier chuckles]Kyle: You have them between your fingers-Goodrich: Yes, I totally do.Kyle: -and you throw them.Goodrich: I push the little – I don’t know if there’s a button on it. It expands [imitates sound].Kyle: There’s not, but you act like there is.Goodrich: Alright. [Rolls dice] So first one’s five.Kyle: That’s your giant goat.Goodrich: Michael Jordan’s back! Uh, [rolls dice] eight.Kyle: Okay. And that is a brown bear.Spurrier: Fantastic.Ali: Great.Goodrich: Okay.Spurrier: Does he or she have a name?Goodrich: Uhhh, Pooh.[Players laugh]Kyle: It always comes back to that, for some reason.Goodrich: I know!Ali: Of course.Spurrier: Such a theme.Kyle: Well, you could name him after the person the school’s founded for: Bear-enthall.Ali: Awww!Spurrier: Ooh.Kyle: If you want to.Goodrich: Does Strumlotts have a mascot? Like, what’s the mascot for Strumlotts?Kyle: It’s a musical instrument. Actually, it’s a crest that is designed of a lute, of course, being Barenthall’s instrument, and there is a songbird perched up on top of it.Goodrich: Oh, okay.Spurrier: Ah, cool.Goodrich: Is there someone out there running around in a songbird costume, you know, like the mascot?[Someone imitates a crow cawing]Kyle: You haven’t seen it yet.[Someone whistles the text message alert sound]Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: You don’t know if there is one. There could be.Goodrich: They’re waiting at the finish line.Spurrier: There could be an opening for one.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: There could be an opening for one.Goodrich: I would – okay.Kyle: Maybe it’s a long-dead tradition that nobody wants to do because of what happened to the last guy who donned the suit.Goodrich: Oh. Well-Kyle: I don’t know. You’d have to ask.Goodrich: I’m gonna find-Kyle: But that’s not-Goodrich: Right.Kyle: That's not the matter right now.Goodrich: I’m just gonna say, being a druid, that’s going through Raz’ul’s mind, like, “I wonder if anyone’s doing that.” Anyways, uh, no, we’ll just go with, uh, Pooh.[Spurrier sighs in relief]Kyle: Michael Jordan and Pooh.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: So you throw these animals out, and they bubble up and burst out of their small fuzzy balls. And then you hear Kage say-Kyle (as Kage): Hey, wait! What are you doing with those?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, they’re just gonna, you know, kinda be on our sides. I didn’t see anything in the official bed races rulebook about having, you know-Kyle (as Kage): I’ll tell you what’s official.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Kage): Y-you, put those away.   Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Kage): We don’t need those clogging up the course.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, okay.Kyle (as Kage): You don’t wind up running over an animal, and you wanna hurt one of your own animals?  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, no, but I just-  Kyle (as Kage): Yeah, yeah, yeah.[Overlapping conversation]Ali (as Yashee): They’re huge.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s fair. Okay. Michael Jordan, Pooh, you stay over here. Pooh, we’ll maybe change your name later to something else cooler. I don’t know.Kyle (as Kage): Get those animals off the course!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, yeah. They’ll just wait here. That’s cool.Kyle (as Kage): Hurry up! People are waiting on you three![Ali laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, yeah. I’m sorry!Kyle (as Kage): Everyone – look down this line! Everyone else is ready!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, alright, alright. Blow the whistle.Kyle (as Kage): Get on the bed, stay on the bed, don’t veer into someone else’s line. There’s not a whistle either.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Ali (as Yashee): There’s no whistle?Kyle (as Kage): No. I’ll tell you when to go.Ali (as Yashee): Do we have helmets or something, just in case?Kyle (as Kage): What do you need helmets for?Ali (as Yashee): Well-Kyle (as Kage): Why do you need helmets?Kyle: And he walks away to go get in place.Kyle (as Kage): These kids. They need helmets to protect themselves. I don’t und- [sighs].Goodrich: Right.Spurrier: I lean over to Raz’ul-Spurrier (as Randy): You’ve still got one. Can you use it during the race?  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhhh? Yeah, totally.Spurrier (as Randy): Just keep that in mind.Goodrich: I high-five you.Spurrier: Sweet.Kyle: Okay. So y’all get in your positions.Goodrich: Aww, your cast. Sorry.[Players laugh]Goodrich: I’m so sad.Spurrier: I’m still broken.Goodrich: I’m sorry.Spurrier: Anyways.Ali: Just to mention, I am gonna rage right before we start, because I do get advantage on strength checks if I do that. So-Kyle: Okay. So you’re getting pumped up.Ali: Yeah. Starting to, yeah, get super psyched. Is there like a countdown, something?Kyle: Yeah. It’s gonna happen here in a second. So everyone gets ready, you three get ready. And Kage stands behind all of you, between lanes 2 and 3 on a platform, and he holds a guitar. His hand is in the air, brandishing a pick. And he shoots all of you a stern look … and quickly strums his guitar [guitar chord], cranking out a multicolored wave of sound that hits you all from the back. It washes over you and pushes you forward all at the same time. Kyle (as Kage): Let’s start the race. Goodrich: Alriiiight!Ali (as Yashee): [raging] Alright, let’s gooooo!Goodrich: Ziff! Like a rocket! Chaos Sauce is out!Kyle: So we’re gonna begin the round. Ali, as the pusher, I want you to go ahead and give me your roll.[Dice rolls]Ali: Okay. That’s eleven plus four – [rolls dice] okay, three plus four.Kyle: Alright, so that’s fifteen. And for the other pushers -- [rolls dice] okay. So you all start off at a very similar pace. However, Yashee, you notice that you are a little bit ahead of the other ones. And as you begin to make your way down the hill, a large, purplish-black swirling circular portal opens above you.Goodrich: Whaa!Kyle: slowly emerging from it is a large yellow column – there’s a slight jiggle to it – but all of a sudden, it is thrusted downward toward your bed. Who wants to go first? Driver, do you want to make a check to dodge it, or defender, do you want to try to deflect it?[Spurrier giggles]Goodrich: [hesitantly] Da – do you want to dodge it?Spurrier: I’ll try to dodge it first.Kyle: Okay.[Dice roll]Spurrier: That is a nine plus four.Kyle: Nine plus four, thirteen. Okay. So you are able to steer your way out of the path of the column, and it slams down into the ground, or it’s headed that way. Defender, do you want to do any deflection or diverting it towards another – toward the bed next to you?Spurrier: Garreth. Garreth.Goodrich: Diverting it towards Garreth.Spurrier: Garreth.Ali: Oh, be careful. Tabitha’s on there too.Goodrich: Specifically Garreth, though, if that’s possible.Kyle: Okay.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Oh! Well, so I got a sixteen plus six, 'cause it’s strength and then proficiency?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Yeah. 'Cause as the defender, what they’ve given you is essentially just a quarterstaff to be able to deflect things.Goodrich: Oh, okay.Kyle: You probably are proficient with that, so-Goodrich: Yeah. I am, Yeah.Kyle: so yeah. So you got a total of twenty-  Goodrich: Twenty-two.Kyle: Twenty-two. Randy, as you dodge this column coming out of this portal, Raz’ul, you take your quarterstaff and you poke at it, and you’re able to see it like bend. You noticed how it was wiggly earlier.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: It actually bends and keeps coming out of the portal until it makes contact with something.Goodrich: With Garreth?Kyle: That contact is with the bed that Garreth-Goodrich: Uhhh!Kyle: -Ilda, and Tabitha are all on.Someone: Oh no!Kyle: So it actually hits the side of the bed. Let me see if there’s a reaction from their defender to be able to deflect that. [Rolls dice] Has to beat what you rolled...and does not.[Players giggle]Kyle: So each obstacle is gonna deal 1D4 plus 1 worth of speed damage, so let’s see. You’d take off – actually, you can go ahead and roll it. Goodrich: Oh. Roll a D4?Kyle: Roll a 1D4, add one, and that’s how many points of speed you knocked off of their-[Dice roll][Players cheer]Goodrich: Four plus one.Kyle: Okay. So it bends out and hits the side of their bed, and kinda causes it to skid a little bit to the side.Goodrich: Uh-huh?Kyle: But Tabitha, who is their pusher, like-Ali: Oo.Kyle: -pulls it back and keeps it going. But you can tell they’ve definitely slowed down and that they’ve fallen behind the – you and the other two groups.  Ali: Let’s wave at them while we pass.Ali (as Yashee): Hey! Hey there!Spurrier (as Randy): Hi Garreth!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hi Garreth! Hi Tabitha!Kyle: Raising his fist up at you and shaking it as he’s steering along, and Ilda is just looking at you like “ugh” as she’s missed deflecting the column.Goodrich: Right, yeah. Err.Kyle: The other two beds, they seem to just dodge around the column. They don’t seem to be affecting each other yet. But man, people are cheering at seeing you three just knock that column into the other bed.Goodrich: Do we hear them chant “Chaos Sauce! Chaos Sauce!”Kyle: Ehh, nobody knows your name that well yet.Goodrich: He said it on the – aw, okay. (Laughs)Kyle: Yeah, there’s a lot of bands here.Goodrich: That’s fair.Kyle: Anyway, so this is the second round. Yashee, go ahead and give me another strength check for-Ali: Alrighty. [rolls dice]Kyle: -that.Ali: Okay. Sixteen [rolls dice] plus four, or four plus four. Let’s do the-Goodrich: The unnatural twent.Ali: -twenty.[“Yeah!” sound effect]Goodrich: Aww.Spurrier: Alright.Kyle: Okay. You keep going, and you see another circular portal open up ahead of you. [Goodrich sighs] And it is keeping pace to stay ahead of where you’re at. The portal starts spitting out short yellow logs in random places. Driver and defender? Need to know what you’re gonna do.Goodrich: You go. I got a system here.Spurrier: Alright, alright. [Rolls dice] So glad I’m a halfling.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Spurrier: Not gonna enjoy that one very much. [Rolls dice] Wow. Okay.Goodrich: Another one?Kyle: Double ones?Spurrier: Double ones.Ali: Alright. Well…Kyle: Okay. Yeah, so in this instant, Yashee, you can subtract a point from your speed to slow down, giving Randy another roll; or Raz’ul, you can start knocking things out of the way. You’d have to roll to see if you do it, but it would also give Randy another roll.Goodrich: I’ll do that. I’ll- [rolls dice] – that’s a twelve plus six.Spurrier: [sounding relieved] Okay.Kyle: So yeah. You successfully – you get in front and you just take your quarterstaff, and you’re just sweeping things out of the way that obviously would have just hit the wheels of the bed, as Randy is like trying to steer it, but it’s just-Spurrier: I’m just looking backwards. Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah.Spurrier: Looking at the road.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey Randy, [singing] let’s get down to business, huh.Goodrich and Spurrier (as Raz’ul and Randy): [both singing] To race-Goodrich, Spurrier and Ali: The beds! Spurrier: Alright. So does that mean I should roll again now? Or does that just mean-Kyle: Yeah, you can go ahead and roll again now.Spurrier: Okay. [Rolls dice] Much better! That is a nine plus four.Kyle: Yeah, you’re easily able to avoid these, now that Raz’ul has sweeped the course clean. However, at this point-Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you, Raz’ul.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Nope. Ilda is trying to use her stick next to you, and she’s trying to like flip them forward, like ahead of you- Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: -‘cause they’re a little bit behind. But she’s flipping them forward to try to get them in front of you, but she just can’t flip them far enough because of how far behind she is.Spurrier: Aww.Goodrich: Errr![Players laugh]Kyle: And you do notice that Bed 4 is actually knocking some of theirs in front of Bed 3 – [rolls dice] – and they actually wind up causing Bed 3 to slow down a little bit. So right now in the placing, we got Chaos Sauce in front-Ali: Ye-yes!Kyle: -The North Stars trailing a little bit behind, along with the Radiant Dissonance, and then, probably in second place, I’d actually consider it, The Golden Meanies.Goodrich: Uh.Spurrier: Alright.Kyle: So Yashee, give me another strength.Ali: Alrighty. [Rolls dice] Oh! A nat twenty. [“Oh yeah!” sound effect with harmony] Oh yeah. Plus four.Kyle: Okay. [Some other weird sound effect. Spurrier and Goodrich laugh] Yashee, you’re just feeling it, you’re getting pumped. And you have this sudden burst of speed come out of you.Ali: It must have been my dash.[All snicker]Kyle: As you are propelling yourself forward, there’s another circular portal that opens above you and ahead of your position, and you see large balls begin to drop out of it-Ali: Oh no!Kyle: -large yellow ones, followed by several others that begin to bounce in your direction on the course. This is all happening for everybody. So, steering? Deflecting?Spurrier: Let’s-Kyle: What do y’all wanna do?Spurrier: Let’s try steering again.Goodrich: Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): C’mon, Randy![Dice roll]Spurrier: That is a nineteen plus four.Goodrich: Nice!Kyle: Okay. Yeah, you’re able to steer deftly in between these bouncing balls that are headed your direction, which, Raz’ul, that leaves you the opportunity to deflect them to another bed, if you’d like to.Ali: How many balls does he get to smack?Kyle: I’m gonna say you get – you can smack two balls.[dice roll]Goodrich: Uh, I’m gonna try to smack them towards the one in second place. Is that cool?Kyle: Okay. So that’s gonna be the Gold Meanies.Goodrich: Yeah, so [rolls dice] a five plus six, eleven. Kyle: That hits.Goodrich: Oh![Ali laughs]Kyle: Let me see if they’re able to deflect those. [Rolls dice] Okay. So a ball bounces across two lanes and heads toward the Golden Meanies, but you can see one of their members, with her quarterstaff, catches the ball out of the corner of their eye and whacks it away just in time-Goodrich: Ugh.Kyle: -keeping them from suffering any negative penalty. It’s a far shot. You did good though.Goodrich: Yeah, I try.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I try, guys.Kyle: They just had a good reaction. However, you’re looking at this, and then you notice, from the third lane, you notice a ball headed your direction-Goodrich: Uh-oh.Kyle: -that’s overshooting the North Stars’ bed. [Rolls dice] And it sails over your bed. [Players cheer] It actually does a miss. Man.Ali: Yay!Kyle: Alright. So that wraps up round three, let’s go to round four. Yashee, go ahead and give me another push; I’m gonna roll for the other three.Ali: Alright. [Rolls dice]Goodrich: How close are we to the finish line?[Multiple dice roll]Kyle: You notice you’re maybe one more round after this one away from the finish line.Goodrich: Okay.Randy: Oh man.Ali: Alright. Well, I rolled a nineteen plus four-Goodrich: Dang!Spurrier: Dang.Ali: But let me just check…Spurrier: Get that natural twent again.Goodrich: Seriously.Ali: Nah.Spurrier: Okay.Goodrich: Man, Yashee’s freakin’ swift as the coursing river.[Someone giggles]Ali: I love a good competition. I assume those – the hotel stay comes with room service- [players laugh] – like oh my god, think about how much I can eat in bed.[Goodrich chuckles]Kyle: Okay, yeah. You three can obviously tell you’re significantly ahead of the rest of the group; you feel like you pretty much have this in the bag. And as you’re thinking you’re in the clear, you see several small portals open ahead of you on the ground, and you see yellow pillars erupt from them, not unlike a whack-a-mole popping up.Goodrich: Right.Spurrier: Oh no. Goodrich: Whack-a-bard.Kyle: Driver and defender, let’s see – what are you gonna do about it?Spurrier: Let’s drive. Goodrich: Drive.Spurrier: Most Extreme Randy!Goodrich: Randy Driver!  Spurrier: That is a five plus four.Kyle: That is not gonna cut it.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh no! Defend me!Kyle: So-Goodrich: Okay, I’ll defend it. Here we go.Kyle: Go for it.[Dice roll]Goodrich: That’s an eight plus six.Kyle: Eight plus six?Goodrich: So-Kyle: Okay. You’re able to deflect a few, but one of them actually catches the back corner of the wheel; it jostles you up a little bit.   Spurrier (as Randy): Hang on!Kyle: And [rolls dice] you notice the other drivers are having a little bit of trouble with this, the other pushers. With the North Stars, it looks like Tabitha has kind of slipped, lost her footing at one point, and they’ve kind of fallen behind now. Radiant dissonance is catching up to them, and the Golden Meanies are slowly making their way into the same little pack. They’re almost in the same area. But Ilda is deft with her quarterstaff, and she’s going to deflect one of these things popping out of the ground into your direction.    Goodrich: Alright.Kyle: And it bends over – let’s see if it hits. [Rolls dice] No, it’s not gonna hit. [Players laugh] Goodrich: Oh wow!Kyle: In fact, it’s going to bounce – she’s pushing with the pole, and her quarterstaff slips-Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: -and it springs back and hits their bed. [Players laugh] And-Goodrich: Sucks!Kyle: -again, that’s a critical miss if you ever saw one.Spurrier: Oh man.Kyle: That slows them down significantly, and they drop behind the other two.Ali: Ohh.Kyle: With you three leading the pack, of course.Spurrier (as Randy): [softly] Bye, Garreth. Kyle: And we are in the last round. You can tell the finish line is right there, almost got it. Yashee, give me that strength check again.Goodrich: Uh oooh![Dice roll]Ali: Okay, four plus four.Kyle: At advantage.Ali: And [rolls dice] eight plus four.Goodrich: Gotta get all the fours, force of a great typhoon.Kyle: Okay. So you’re pushing yourself forward, you’ve got the finish line in sight! And a large square portal opens over the last stretch of the race. Several yellow pendulums drop down, swinging asynchronously. Give me my checks, defender and driver.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You wanna switch it up for this last one?Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, if you want to?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t want to. Spurrier: Okay. [Both chuckle] That’s the spirit. [Rolls dice] That is a thirteen plus four.Goodrich: Yes.Kyle: Thirteen plus four. You are able to make your way through these, steering back and forth- [Spurrier sighs in relief] –as Yashee is pushing with all of her might. Raz’ul, whatcha gonna do?Goodrich: I’m gonna roll [rolls dice] and get a fifteen plus six.Ali: Alright!Kyle: Alright. You hit one. Which bed are you trying to hit?Goodrich: I guess the Golden Meanies. You said they were pretty close to us?Kyle: Yeah, Golden Meanies or Radiant Dissonance. I’d say the North Stars are in last.Goodrich: Alright. I – well, what am I hitting?Kyle: You’re hitting a giant, swinging ball.Goodrich: Oh, okay. So then I line it up, Babe Ruth style, and point to-Ali: [Laughs] Point backward.Goodrich: Yeah, then smack it at ‘em.Kyle: Alright, you smack it at ‘em. The ethereal string that it looks like it’s connected to – like, the tether snaps, goes flying off, [rolls dice; Ali laughs] – and, man, it just lands right in the middle of their bed.Ali: Ohh!Kyle: And you can go ahead and roll that D4 to see what kind of speed damage you do to them.Goodrich: Okay. [rolls dice] Three plus one.Kyle: Three plus one. And you were going for the Golden Meanies, right?Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: Alright. So that pretty much makes it to where they – they’re not moving any faster this last round.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: Alright. You made it across the finish line.Ali: Alright. For those final few moments, I’m gonna hop on and like put my feet up on the-Kyle: Oh, you ride it to the finish?Ali: -the bottom rail.Goodrich: Like a shopping cart.Ali (as Yashee): Yeaaah!Ali: Put my hands way up as we cross.Goodrich: Then you fall off.Ali: So fall backwards, just kick it over.Kyle: Yeah. So the crowd’s going wild; you’re sitting there, just hands pumped in the air, Yashee; Raz’ul, you had just lined up and Babe-Ruthed one out of the park, Randy, you’re driving like a madman.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And you cross the line-Goodrich: Pull the handbrake.[Laughter]Kyle: Yeah, you pull the handbrake, skid to a stop. Everyone’s like “Yeah! Alright!”Goodrich: That’s when you hear [chanting] “Chaos Sauce! Chaos Sauce!”Kyle: That’s when you hear “Chaos Sauce.” People are chanting. Kage comes up, he walks down, and he looks at you three and he’s just like-Kyle (as Kage): Heh, not bad for people who didn’t know what they were doing. Not bad.”  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s what people normally say about us.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Kage): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): “They do alright for a bunch of musicians.”Kyle (as Kage): Cool. Well, I tell you what.Kyle: And he reaches into his pocket and he pulls out three damp-looking brochures. Goodrich: Ugh.Kyle: And he’s just like-Kyle (as Kage): Yeah, here are your passes. If you go to the Bicentennial, just present these to the front clerk – a friend of mine – and they’ll get you taken care of. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Kage): Hope you enjoy the Bicentennial if you’re able to get it, or … you could scalp ‘em-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh!Kyle (as Kage): -if you need to make some extra cash.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know if you know this, but being at a bard school, maybe we could play some sort of show there?Kyle (as Kage): [noncommittal noise] I don’t know if you’re there yet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay.Kyle (as Kage): Maybe one of the upperclassmen. They might be there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Kage): But, uh, you know what? What’s your name? You got a card?[Players cheer]Goodrich: I whip them out and I spread them out, Yu-gi-oh! style, like “huaaa!” Put one … right in his hand.Kyle (as Kage): Excellent. Tell you what. I’ll talk to my friend. Maybe, maybe. I’m not making any promises.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I will admit, if you like the way we race beds, you should hear us, you know, laying the freakin’ beats down, you know?Kyle (as Kage): Well, hopefully it’s better than how you race beds.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, that was -Kyle (as Kage): Not that this was bad.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): -pretty good, I thought. Okay.Kyle (as Kage): Yeah, yeah. It’s not bad. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle (as Kage): I’ve seen better.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Well, sure, it was our first try. [Whispering] C’mon.Kyle (as Kage): Yeah. Anyway. Ali (as Yashee): Alright. Is there a place to get, like, our picture taken? Are we in the newspaper or-Goodrich: The school newspaper.Kyle (as Kage): No, everyone knows it. School newspaper? Who does that?Ali: I put the brochure in my mouth and I bite it like Olympics style.Goodrich: And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Gross, Yashee!Ali (as Yashee): It’s paper. This is not a good idea.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No.Kyle: So, you know, there’s a celebration. You’re actually standing around with some of the other upperclassmen that have won, and – you know, there’s one from each class.  Goodrich: Right, yeah.Kyle: So you’re all like in a winners’ circle and everything like that. Most of the upperclassmen are kinda just like giving you a solemn nod-Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: -in your accomplishment.Goodrich: Nice!Kyle: But it doesn’t look like they’re really wanting to engage you at all. [Ali chuckles] They’re just like “not bad, freshies. Not bad.”Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What do we do? Do we play it cool or do we try to-[Spurrier grunts]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I kinda wanna give one of ‘em our card, but-Goodrich: I’m just pumped up because he actually asked for a card, so I’ve got them in my hand, ready. [Players snicker] I’m gonna roll a constitution check. [Rolls dice] Oh, that’s fourteen, that’s pretty good. So I withstand.Spurrier: You handle yourself?Goodrich: Yeah. [Players laugh] Instead of like – instead of just barfing all over. Spurrier: You’re so cool. Goodrich: Ugh! Kyle: Okay. After a while of chilling in the winners’ circle and everything, getting some special treatment with drinks and some specially made foods from Alto Brown, Symbol finds you three. Comes over and he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): Hey!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Heyyy!Kyle (as Symbol): Caught y'all doing a little bit of the racing, just at the tail end there. What a show! Seemed like the crowd was really pumped. I could barely make it to the front of the line.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, who would have thought so many people would show up for the freshman race. Crazy!Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, you know. Well, thing is, most of the freshmen don’t know what they’re doing, and it’s more of a thing to laugh at.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Pshaw.Kyle (as Symbol): But, you know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Gotcha.Kyle (as Symbol): Each year you get a little bit better.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): But I’m glad y'all had a good time. It looked like you were having fun, so-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Randy, do you wanna say anything to Splash about earlier?Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, Randy.Spurrier: Uh, well, I was going to [everyone laughs] – I was gonna give – I mean, we got special food from the winners’ circle, right?Kyle: Yeah.Spurrier: Okay. So I turn to Splash and say-Spurrier (as Randy): Splash?Kyle (as Symbol): Yes, Randy? Spurrier (as Randy): Sorry about the hair thing. I got you some special winners’ circle treats. I hope it’s a mild peace offering.Kyle (as Symbol): Ooh, what do you have?Spurrier: What do I have?[Players giggle]Kyle: Make up something.Spurrier: Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): I’ve got some … Beddie-bye Bumcakes.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): Oh, Beddie-bye Bumcakes, ooh!Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, they’re only given to the winners, and you’re a winner in my book. [Goodrich and Ali laugh] And I’m sorry that I took your hair. I really was just gonna smell it. I mean, I could put it in the Viewdoo Doll-Kyle (as Symbol): That’s not any less weird, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): I know, but I wasn’t gonna spy on you.[Players giggle]Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. I guess that’s less-Spurrier (as Randy): So I hope it makes it-Kyle (as Symbol): You’re trying.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): You’re trying.Spurrier (as Randy): I appreciate that you appreciate my trying.Kyle (as Symbol): I have to remember you’re trying.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. Yes.Kyle: And he holds out his hand.Spurrier: Oh. And I place them-Kyle: Definitely.Spurrier: -ever so delicately.Kyle: He sneaks it inside of his cloak pocket.Spurrier: Whew.Kyle: Is just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Yes, excellent. Well, go enjoy the rest of your evening. I’ve gotta go hit up the library; I’m gonna be doing some reading. I’ve been reading Funkowitz’s Theory on Form and Harmony, which has been quite intriguing, but, uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool.Spurrier (as Randy): Sweet.Ali (as Yashee): Sounds great.Kyle (as Symbol): Catch y'all later, and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): I’ll talk to you on Monday, if not sooner.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright.Goodrich: And as he’s leaving, I’m gonna do a stealth check, see if I can grab some hair. Spurrier: Oh gawd. [Spurrier and Ali snicker][Dice roll]Goodrich: Er, I guess sleight-of-hand, but regardless, it’s a ten plus JOAT. Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: One.Kyle: Same thing that happened to Randy.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m just playin'! I’m just playin', Splash! I’m just playin'!Ali: You’re just tug on it a little.Kyle: You get some of his hair in his hand [sic]. As he’s walking away, his head gets pulled back. Turns around, he’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): What is the deal?!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m sorry. It’s just a fun game we’ve been playing as like, see if you can get Splash’s hair. [Players laugh] Sorry. I’m so-Kyle: Deception check.Goodrich: Okay. [Rolls dice]Ali: Oooh!Goodrich: Maestro? [“Oh yeah” sound effect] Oh, natural twent!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Look, it’s just a fun game we’re playing, alright? Just-Goodrich: And I pat him on the back. I kinda put his hair back in place.[Ali snorts]Kyle: No. He takes his hair, buns it up-Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah.Kyle: -and puts his hat back on, and just says-Kyle (as Symbol): Alright. Well, I’m just going to solve this problem. I want this game to stop. [Players laugh] This is not fun for me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. I’m sorry.Kyle (as Symbol): Do you like people pulling your hair?  Goodrich: No, but it’s-Kyle (as Symbol): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Well – I’m sorry. Kyle (as Symbol): If you wouldn’t want it done to you, why would you do it to other people?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I – yeah, okay.Goodrich: And I give him some of my treats that I have. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): This – is this cool? We’re cool, right? Treats for you.Kyle (as Symbol): You’re not Randy.[Players mumble]Spurrier (as Randy): I am trying.Ali (as Yashee): You’re not cute enough.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, for sure. NO. Okay. Well, no. Sorry. We’ll stop playing the game. I’m sorry, Splash. Kyle (as Symbol]: Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. [giggling] Have a good weekend.Ali (as Yashee): Bye, Splash. Have fun in the library.Spurrier (as Randy): Byeee.Kyle (as Symbol): Bye, Yashee, I will. You enjoy your … weekend too.Ali: I’ve devoured my treats already.Goodrich: Yeah, none for Splash.Ali: Nope.Kyle: Alright. So Splash begins walking off, and you notice it’s toward the end of the celebration of bed races and people are starting to disperse. Everything is being broken down; Kage is doing his jobs of, you know, cleaning everything up, very begrudgingly looking, of course.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So the other events that could go on tonight: There’s stargazing happening. I don’t know what anyone else wants to do with their evening. Ali: Well, I’m definitely gonna go to the stargazing. I was gonna take Sandy down there and-Goodrich: [Snickering] Okay.Ali: -lay under like a big pillow I promised I would take her, so-[Guys laugh]Kyle: Alright. Goodrich: I kind wanna follow Splash a little bit, not like to actually sneak, but maybe Randy – or I could ask you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Randy, maybe we could follow Splash, maybe go to the dance club tonight, you know. Spurrier (as Randy): Oooh!Goodrich: It’s what, Saturday night, you said?Kyle: Saturday Night.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Saturday Night fever going on tonight and-Spurrier (as Randy): Alright for fightin'.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s right. So maybe we can see if Splash actually went to the library or not.Spurrier (as Randy): Just passing by-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): -give a little peek.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Exactly. Then just go dance it up.Spurrier (as Randy) Okay.Kyle: Well, I’ll just go ahead and say you two go by the library, and you notice the doors are actually closed and it’s locked up. It’s got a sign that says “Closed for Bed Race Day and evening times.”Goodrich: Oh. Was it ever open today, do we know?Kyle: No. It wasn’t open today.Goodrich: Oh, well, well.Spurrier: Oh ho ho, dear readers.Goodrich: Oh ho ho, dear readers. Okay. Well-Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s go dance.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Let’s go dance it off.Kyle: Alright. So you go and you get ready for hitting the club, and you manage to make your way down there. You’ve figured out a pretty solid method of [Goodrich and Spurrier laugh] getting where you need to be for that.Ali: They know you now. They’re like, “Ugh, you guys.”Goodrich: Oh yeah. I go-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know if you saw us. You know, we won the bed races.Goodrich: Flashing my little thing.Kyle: They give you a solemn nod like, “Oh yeah.”Goodrich: Yeah. They lift the velvet rope up and let us in. Cool.Kyle: But Yashee, I guess you’re gonna go do stargazing. So you pull out the tab that you pulled from the Bulletin Bard, and it - you notice it says “Hill behind the stables” with several stars drawn around it. So you’re gonna go there with Sandy, you said?Ali: Yeah, I’m gonna go grab Sandy from the stable.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Check up on her, make sure everything looks good there, clean.Kyle: You go in there and Sandy looks very content. It looks like Mitch has spread some sand around inside of her stall.Ali: Mitch.Kyle: And you notice Zil’s just standing in the corner, facing it – [Goodrich laughs] – and is just standing there. Kinda like turns and looks at you, a little bit of spit and dribble dropping from, I guess, their lip, and just kinda looks at you, tilts their head, and then looks back at the corner and just [grunts sleepily]. Ali (as Yashee): Zil, you can come with me and Sandy if you want to.Kyle: Doesn’t respond.Ali: Okay. [Goodrich and Spurrier laugh] I tried.Kyle: Yeah. So-Ali: Alright, so I grab her leash, lead her out. Um…oh, she has the star blanket; I’ll grab that too.Kyle: Okay.Ali: And I’ve brought snacks, of course. So-Goodrich: Naturally.Ali: So we’ll head on down there.Kyle: Alright. So you’re heading out, and the sun has set. The moons are in a waning gibbous, if anybody needs to know.Goodrich: Nice.Kyle: So – but as you and Sandy are leaving, you begin to hear the sounds of a ukulele being played. You follow the music to behind the stables, and find Tabitha sitting down on a large blanket with several stars sewn into it. It looks like a larger version of Sandy’s favorite blanket, and you notice Sandy is flipping out [players giggle] over seeing this blanket, and starts like jumping and just flopping towards her. [Goodrich makes animal sounds; Ali laughs] Hovering above the blanket, you see a sign that says “Stargazers Unite,” and underneath it, it is written “and have a star cookie, courtesy of Alto Brown.” A plate of star cookies sits underneath the sign on the blanket. Tabitha sees you, stands up, stops playing, and is super excited to see you. And she’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): [gasps] Oh … Yashee! And what – what is that?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, yeah, you haven’t met her. This is Sandy! Uh, I think I was telling you about her. Kyle (as Tabitha): She’s absolutely adorable!Ali (as Yashee): Uh, she’s my sandatee that I got from Basom.   Kyle (as Tabitha): And she’s got a little star blanket just like – just like my blanket!Ali (as Yashee): It’s her favorite blanket. I knew you would appreciate it.Kyle (as Tabitha): This is – this is my favorite!Ali (as Yashee): Oh.Kyle (as Tabitha): Aww, that’s so adorable! C’mon, c’mon, have a seat.Ali (as Yashee): Alright.Kyle (as Tabitha): You see, we’re waiting on other people to join-Ali (as Yashee): I was gonna say, where’s the rest of the group?Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, last time I checked, I only saw one or two of the tabs pulled from the Bulletin Bard – Bulletin board. Sorry. Someone marked out that O and it just, you know, sticks with you like that. But no, I mean, we can wait for a couple other people. I was just working on a – I figured a song for the group would be appropriate, and something we can play whenever we meet. Ali (as Yashee): Okay.Kyle (as Tabitha): So you wanna hear what I’m working on?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, let’s hear it.Kyle (as Tabitha): Still kinda fleshing it out, but…okay, yeah. Let me play it for you real quick.[Ukulele chord]Kyle (as Tabitha): [singing, accompanied by ukulele] Stargazers unite, stargazing all through the night, and when you find your shining star you’ll know, oh whoa oh, ‘cause it will shine for you, and I will wanna see. ‘Cause if our stars are the same, we can learn to share, it’s just a game, but I wanna be fair. We’ll name it something new, just me and you.    Ali (as Yashee): Tabs, that was awesome! I loved it!Kyle (as Tabitha): Aww, thanks, Yashee. I appreciate it. It just – yeah, it’s still something I’m working on for this little club that I wanted to put together.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah. More people better show up, they need to hear that. Kyle (as Tabitha): Aww, thanks. I appreciate it. You’re – well, you’re too nice sometimes.Ali (as Yashee): I do my best. So what are we – what are we seeing up here?Kyle (as Tabitha): I mean, while we’re waiting on people, yeah. Come here, have a seat. Have a cookie, please. Ali (as Yashee): I might have a few.Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, well-Ali: Feed one to Sandy.Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, I mean, if you look up there in the northern sky, you can see the Unstrung Harp. Which, that’s a constellation that just forms the shape of a harp, but there’s – you notice how there’s a void in there? There’s no other stars. So there’s that. Over there is Barenthall’s Lute-Ali (as Yashee): Oh.Kyle (as Tabitha): And you have Reedaba’s Tear. Kyle: And she goes on through and lists a few more, and, you know, she’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Of course, we can make up our own constellations. That’s half the fun of just stargazing. It’s kinda like cloud-gazing, if you’ve ever done that.Ali (as Yashee): Okay. Hmm.Kyle (as Tabitha): So yeah. Any constellations that pop out to you?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, there’s like a Zil right there. I can see his-[Goodrich and Spurrier laugh]Kyle (as Tabitha): What’s a Zil?Ali (as Yashee): Oh, he’s in the stable. You should come meet him too, but he – I’ll let Randy introduce you to Zil.   Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay. Well, I mean, while it’s just me and you here, I hate to mention it, but I found out that my teacher Christina was actually your dad’s teacher when he was here.Ali (as Yashee): Cool.Kyle (as Tabitha): Um, so, you know, I’ve heard a little bit about him. She was talking about it because she heard your name at the – at the opening ceremony and everything. So-Ali (as Yashee): What was she saying about him?Kyle (as Tabitha): Ah, just saying he’s a different character of sorts. Ali: [chuckling] Yeah, definitely. Kyle (as Tabitha): You know, not – not necessarily meant for the school, but not necessarily not meant for barding.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah. He – you know, he told me a little bit about his time here, but he didn’t want to get too much into it. He, um, I think, lived most of his, you know, best days out on the road with my mom and stuff.Kyle (as Tabitha): Oh yeah? Are they still traveling together, or what’s going on? Ali (as Yashee): Um, well, I actually haven’t seen my mom in a while. They used to travel with me, but a couple years ago, she actually had to, like, leave suddenly. She went – she went to her home tribe and – and left us on the road.Kyle (as Tabitha): Oh, where’s that at? Ali (as Yashee): Uh, well, I’m not super sure, but it’s somewhere in Arlin? Um, so I’ve never actually gotten to visit 'cause I don’t really know where it is. You know, Arlin’s such a big place.Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay. Well, I mean, that’s … I can – I can relate to that. I mean, my – my mom actually left early on. Her father would tell her tales of a moving island that held unknown riches. Uh, and she left one day to seek that out, and I haven’t seen her since. But I’m gonna find her though. Her or that island, whichever comes first. Maybe both at the same time, if she found what she was looking for. I just have to keep looking the whole world over.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, that’s – [chuckles] – that’s kind of a similar situation. I – I’ve always wanted to go find her, and cross the Great George Strait, but I – you know.[Goodrich and Spurrier laugh]Kyle: That would be a body of water between Beetzart and Arlin, yes. It is.[Ali laughs too]Ali (as Yashee): But even if I got over there, I wouldn’t know where to start. She’s never even told me the name of her tribe.Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, I tell you what. You wanna see something cool?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah. I love-Kyle (as Tabitha): You wanna see how I wind up – I search the whole world over?Ali (as Yashee): Sure.Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay.Kyle: And she kinda sits crisscross applesauce in front of you, and she looks you dead in the eyes. She’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Do you trust me?Ali (as Yashee): [Pause, stammers a bit] I think I do. I think-Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay. Hold my hands.Ali (as Yashee): Okay. Uh, you’re not gonna, like, take me into, like, that void place, are you? ‘Cause I did not like that.Kyle: She tilts her head oddly and looks at you, and she’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Not there.Ali (as Yashee): Okay, cool. Well then, let’s do this. Alright.Kyle: She grabs your hands, and out of nowhere, you’re suddenly standing in a foreign place. The ground beneath you is made of small blue rocks that litter a craggy and coarse landscape. The red moon Brubeck looms closer than you’ve ever seen it before, and a ways away from Brubeck is a blue-and-green moon that you’ve never seen before. Tabitha looks at you excitedly, and she says-  Kyle (as Tabitha): Guess what, Yashee?Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, what?Kyle (as Tabitha): That’s our world! That’s Algar!Ali (as Yashee): Whooooa! So where-Kyle (as Tabitha): Wait, look there! Look there! That bit of land? That’s Beetzart! And you have the Terrapin Isles to the northeast.Ali (as Yashee): Uh-huh.Kyle (as Tabitha): And to the east, you have the west coast of Alkan. And there, down there, Is Arlin. I mean, you can barely see it because it’s a little bit further south, but that’s – that’s where you said your mom might be, right?Ali (as Yashee): Tabitha, where are we right now? Like– like where are we standing?Kyle (as Tabitha): Well, we’re not standing here-Ali: I look down.Kyle (as Tabitha): -literally.Ali: Is there any – am I standing – are we just floating?Kyle: Yeah, you’re – well, you’re -- it looks like you’re standing on the surface of a planet. And from context clues and everything, you venture to guess that you’re on the blue moon Themarcels.Ali (as Yashee): [whispering] Oh my god.Kyle: She’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Yeah, we’re actually standing on Themarcels, and this is how I wind up searching the world for that island. And then, it’s also a good way to just see the world, and I figured maybe if you could see Arlin, you could find out, you know, where you need to go. Most people don’t have like a full world map; I don’t know how many cartographers have completely circumnavigated our globe. But – and there’s Apolonia out to the east. Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Kyle (as Tabitha): That’s my favorite one.Kyle: And you can see – the world is slowly turning, and you can see Apolonia coming into view. And it’s at this point she’s just beaming with a smile, and all of a sudden she looks really confused. She’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Wait a second! Do you – do you see that, Yashee?       Kyle: And she points a little north of where Apolonia is, and you begin to see – you begin to see a small dot form, and that dot begins to grow in size. And there’s a newly formed landmass where she’s pointing. And it’s at this moment, before you even bring into idea what you’re looking at, that you notice you’re back on the hillsides behind the stables. Tabitha is freaking out, and she looks at you and she’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Oh my gosh, I need my notebook! That’s – that was – that was it! That was it, Yashee, that had to be it!Ali (as Yashee): What was it?Kyle (as Tabitha): The moving island my mom was talking about. I – [babbles]Ali (as Yashee): I thought it was a disappearing island. I have to sit down for a second. This is-Kyle (as Tabitha): No, it’s okay. Uh – I’m sorry. [to herself] Never do this without your map ready, never do this without your map ready. Um, Y-y-yashee, would you mind staying here in case anybody else shows up? I’ve –Ali (as Yashee): [stammers]Kyle (as Tabitha): I’ve gotta go do something.Ali (as Yashee): I – I – I – I actually need to go. I’m…this is a little…Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay. Well-Ali (as Yashee): Sandy needs to go to bed.Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay. Well, I’m gonna pack this up. I’m … I’m sorry. If an apology is needed, uh, it’s-Ali (as Yashee): I just – I just didn’t realize what was going on. I got a little scared.Kyle (as Tabitha): It’s okay. I – I apologize for scaring you, but this is monumental for me, and this is very different. So I – I apologize for abruptly leaving like I, huh, I guess I have before. Um, I promise not to make this a trend. I appreciate you coming out to Stargazers, and thanks for listening to my song, but I-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Kyle (as Tabitha): I’ve gotta mark this down before it – before it falls out of my head.Ali (as Yashee): Alright. Well, you have a good night, and I’ll – I’ll catch you around, Tabitha.Kyle (as Tabitha): Okay, Yashee. Thanks again. I-Kyle: And she pulls together her blanket, hands you the plate of cookies. She’s like-Kyle (as Tabitha): Please, just take these, I – I gotta go.Ali (as Yashee): Mhm.Kyle: -and head off. And you wind up taking Sandy back – you get her all situated – and you make your way back to the dorms to find Randy and Raz’ul making their way back from the dance club.  Goodrich: All sweaty.Ali: Oh yeah.Kyle: Yup. Do you converse at all about it? Are you keeping it to yourself or-Ali: I’ll offer them some cookies.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh!Spurrier (as Randy): Just famished.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I’m so hungry!Ali (as Yashee): You guys look like you need some fuel.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [sighs] How was Stargazers?Ali (as Yashee): It ws … different.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh yeah? What happened? I mean-Ali (as Yashee): We, you know, just looked at some stars and –Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): -and ate cookies.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): How is Tabitha? I mean, I know she’s renting out space to that spooky dude in her noodle, but, uh-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, but, you know. She – she knows all about the stars, so – Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe more than I thought she did.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, that’s good.Ali (as Yashee): But yeah, I think I’m – I’m gonna go hit the hay though.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, cool. Well, sweet.Spurrier (as Randy): Let’s do it.   Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, I’m-Spurrier (as Randy): I’m danced out.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I am exhausted, so-Kyle: Okay. So you hit the hay for the night. We’re gonna end the episode with you being woken up the next morning: someone’s knocking at your door. Y’all go to answer it.Goodrich: I look through the peephole first.Kyle: It’s Symbol.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: And he knocks again. You answer it?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Who is it?Kyle (as Symbol): It’s your teacher, Symbol. Answer the door.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What’s the password?Kyle (as Symbol): Chaos Sauce forever.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yaass!Goodrich: I open the door.Kyle: Okay. He opens the door, and he looks really stern, really, you know, concentrated, and he’s just-Kyle (as Symbol): You three need to go see the Headmistress.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-oh.Kyle (as Symbol): Um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are we in trouble?Kyle (as Symbol): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, phew.Spurrier (as Randy): It’s not for hair or anything?Kyle (as Symbol): No, it’s not for hair, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, good.Kyle (as Symbol): Raz’ul.Kyle: And he kinda breaks for a moment there and kinda like smiles to himself. He’s like-Kyle (as Symbol): No. You go see her, and I will see you-Kyle: -as he points to Raz’ul-Kyle (as Symbol): -later.Ali: Ooh!Goodrich: Uh-oh.Kyle: And we’ll stop there.[Laughter as the theme music plays]"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-23-getting-schooled-mvt-vi,"Ep. 23 - Getting Schooled, Mvt. VI","Ep. 23 - Getting Schooled, Mvt. VI[Theme music plays]Kyle: Hey everyone! Welcome back to BomBARDed! We’re gonna go through last episode real quick, and it’s gonna be a quick one I think ‘cause we started off with a music lesson, which ended with some hair pulling, and that – Splash didn’t really care for that and told you to get on and get ready for the bed races, which happened the next day, which you three won.  Spurrier: Yes.Ali: Yeah!Kyle: You pulled a win out of your pocket, despite all the odds against you, [Goodrich and Ali giggle] I guess, which you won your two-night stay at the Critz-Carlton.Goodrich: Critz-Carlton, yeah.Ali: Is that for like whenever?Goodrich: (laughs) Just go there now.Kyle: Uh, yeah, it’s for whenever. It was specified it could be used for the Bicentennial coming up, if you wanted to. Ali: Oh, right. Okay. I was like let’s just get out of here.Kyle: Anytime you find yourself in the capital, you could use that and redeem those coupons.  Ali: Sure.Goodrich: How far away is the capital? Do we know? Is that common knowledge?Kyle: Uh, it’s a few days’ travel.Goodrich: Oh, okay.Kyle: A little bit past where you turned off to go to Basom.Goodrich: Not like sneak out at night, go to the Critz-Carlton.Kyle: No. [Ali laughs] No, no, no, not quite that close. But that also ended with Symbol congratulating you, and another attempt at hair pulling which I-Goodrich: It was a fun game. It’s been established.Kyle: Yeah, that’s what it is, a game.Ali: He was not into it.Goodrich: No, so-[Ali laughs]Kyle: He’s not feeling it.Goodrich: No, no.Kyle: It’s not his bag, not his kink. So, we ended the episode with Tabitha and Yashee doing some stargazing together; that included Sandy joining. And there was a small event where Tabitha happened to show you a whole new world, if you will. [Ali laughs] Which, it’s not a whole new world, ‘cause it’s your world, but you saw it from the moon. And Tabitha mentioned that she was searching for something her mom had been searching for, and luckily, in this happenstance, she actually saw it occur, which was an island that appeared north of Apollonia, just emerged out of the sea. And that kind of broke this moment where you were seeing the world, and you came back to the field you were sitting in, and she rushed off in a hurry. And that’s-Ali: Yashee is a little freaked out too.Goodrich: Right.Ali: I mean…Kyle: Yashee, that’s totally fair. I think anybody would be freaked out by that.Ali: Yeah, it was new.  Goodrich: You know.Ali: I wasn’t ready.Kyle: But yeah, so that pretty much, more or less, summed up the episode that happened last time.Goodrich: I was gonna say, Yashee kinda let Drew down. Like, Tabitha – she teed you up with “what’s that right there,” and you shoulda been like [singing quietly] “Rent-a-tee, Sandatee.” [Players laugh] Totally.Ali: Sorry, Drew.Goodrich: Nah, you’ll get it next time.Kyle: So we left off with you waking up. Symbol had stopped by your dorm room to inform you that Headmistress Greenspire requested your presence in her office. He had somewhat of a serious look on his face, but let you know that you weren’t in trouble, but that he would be seeing you here shortly. So let’s pick up there. You’re still in your pajamas, and the last time you went to the headmistress’s office, you were caught off guard and had to report immediately. Since you know about this meeting, what would you wear? [Goodrich chuckles] What are you gonna get dressed in?Goodrich: Uhh…Ali: I think Yashee will throw on her very best pantsuit.[Guys laugh]Kyle: Okay.Ali: Which is still like pretty torn up and, you know.Goodrich: Yeah. Haven’t had a chance to iron it since you got here.Ali: Yeah, you know.Goodrich: Yeah, that’s fair. Um, I think maybe I’ll brush my hair, I suppose.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: And then just wear what I normally wear. But maybe put a couple of flowers in there.Ali: Yeah. Neat – like, tighten up your braid.Goodrich: Right, yeah. And I’ll definitely, you know, make sure to rub some potpourri underneath my arms.  Spurrier: And I sadly take off my teddy bear jumper onesie [others laugh] and I comb out my feet hair. And Randy doesn’t have a lot of clothes, so yeah, he just wants to make sure his hair on his feet is all nice and prim and proper.Goodrich: Right. Ali: Put a little bowtie on Joby. [Laughs]Spurrier: There you go. Exactly! Yeah, perfect!Goodrich: That’s little-known lore about Halfling is like, it’s all about your foot hair.Ali: Uh-huh, uh-huh.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: That shows you really care-Goodrich: Right.  Spurrier: -about what you’re doing.Goodrich: It’s like doing your fingernails or plucking your nose hairs or something.[Ali chuckles]Kyle: Alright. So you get dressed and begin to make your way to Greenspire’s office. On your way, you notice the school is rather quiet. There are a few students milling about, and you notice that they appear to be ready to leave on assignment. Some of them are double-checking lists of equipment, some of them are conversing with their teachers that you aren’t really familiar with, and you do hear a few whispers in the hall as you pass through. Goodrich: [Whispering] Chaos Sauce, Chaos Sauce!Ali: [Whispering] I hear they’re damn good.[Players laugh]Spurrier: Damn right!Ali: [Whispering] Damn right.Kyle: I mean, you don’t know what they’re saying. If you wanna check, you’d have to roll a perception check. Up to you though.Goodrich: Let’s do it. [Multiple dice rolls] Oooh, Kyle, it’s a nineteen plus five!Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: That is a two plus three.Kyle: Okay.Ali: A seventeen plus one.Goodrich: Like “there goes Raz’ul. I heard he made out with a hotdog!” [Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That was one time!Kyle: Alright. So yeah. Raz’ul and Yashee, you actually hear people saying “Hey, I think that’s Chaos Sauce. The freshman class that won the bed race, aren’t they?” And everyone’s kind of like, yeah, noticing you as you’re walking through the hall.Goodrich: We saved an entire town, and all people know us for is winning the freakin’ bed race.Kyle: I mean, they’re just other students, they only know what they know. They haven’t left the school, so-Goodrich: That’s fair. Yeah, you’re right.Kyle: Getting ahead of yourself there.Ali: We’re humble, you know.Goodrich: I know. Right, right, right. Take it in stride.Kyle: Okay. So you reach the headmistress’s office area, and the secretary is rifling through papers, organizing them into different stacks. And without looking up at you three, she just says-Kyle (as secretary): Chaos Sauce?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Yes?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yup.Kyle (as secretary): Okay. The headmistress is waiting, go on in.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool.[sound effect]Kyle: She pushes a button, the door begins to open.Goodrich: And – but while it’s opening, I say- Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [whispering] Hey, remember, Splash wasn’t there with us at Basom. He was Luey Hewis.Spurrier (as Randy): Well, he was at the very end.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Spurrier (as Randy): You could say that at least.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I don’t know how much he told Headmistress. I’m on this like “I don’t know what to think about Splash” kick right now, guys, so, you know.Ali (as Yashee): Mhm, mhm.Spurrier (as Randy): Seems to be your flavor.Kyle: Like, since day one.Goodrich: [laughs] Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, I don’t know. I mean, I think that Splash is very-Goodrich: The door is just very slowly opening up.[Ali laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Splash is like very – errrr? He’s a really, uh, complex character.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): We’ll just talk about ourselves. What we did.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): There ya go. Alright. Goodrich: And then I push the doors open dramatically.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): This is taking way too long! Just kidding, Headmistress. Here we are.Kyle: Okay. So you walk in the office?Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Yep.Kyle: Alright. So you enter the office and see her standing, leaning over her desk, actively reading. She looks somber at first, but then looks up at you with a smile and gestures toward some chairs.  Kyle (as Alola): Please, have a seat. Word around the school is you three are quite the bed racers.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh my gosh. We also saved a town! But yes.[Ali laughs]Kyle (as Alola): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We can race a mean bed too.Kyle (as Alola): I remember seeing your journal entries, yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh! Wait, you saw our journal entries?Kyle (as Alola): Yes. I try to go through as many of the journal entries as I can and- Goodrich: I didn’t think I turned my journal in.Ali: Is it like magic journals that, you know, everything you write in it-Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier: Cool.Kyle: Yeah, you write in. That was like one of the first things you got back. Ali: All those doodles.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle (as Alola): It’s how we catalog things and, you know, are able to obtain the information from you bards-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Roger.Kyle (as Alola): -going out and everything. So … Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): Yes?Kyle (as Alola): I like your drawings.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, thank you.Kyle (as Alola): They’re cute. You could use more words. Pictionary is, huh, okay.Spurrier (as Randy): A picture’s worth a thousand words, so I easily wrote more than either of them combined. [Ali laughs] So-Goodrich: Uh.Kyle (as Alola): I guess that’s a fair squid pro quo, huh?[Players all laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh no! Please no!Kyle (as Alola): Well, I’m sure you don’t think I brought you here just to talk about your career as bed racers or your last mission. No, in fact, I have a much more pressing issue. We recently sent a sophomore group, Tubular Phunk Karate. [Goodrich laughs] It’s a sophomore group, Tubular Phunk Karate – phunk spelled with a ph.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Naturally.Kyle (as Alola): They were on a recovery assignment, the details of which I can’t disclose to you. But regardless, they have been on assignment uncharacteristically long, and we need a group to … go and see what may be delaying them. Unfortunately, we are in a predicament where assignments have been given to the upper classes that require their level of skill. And this has only recently come to our attention – Brenda brought it up to me. And that being said, I would normally send a class above the freshman level.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hmm.Kyle (as Alola): There’s one caveat to this though: you will need to be placed in your colleges prematurely, which I’m ready to do. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. Also, have you just tried calling them on their Ira Glass? That usually works.Kyle (as Alola): Yes. I’ve thought about these things. I’m here where I am in my position because of what I’m able to do, so-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Goodrich: I put my hand back down.Kyle: Yeah. Just, yeah.Kyle (as Alola): I’m ready to do this, but I’m only doing this because this assignment has been classified as for those currently in their individual colleges, as mandated by the Bureau of Better Barding. I understand if you’d prefer to proceed through school similar to your peers. If you do accept this task, know that this does not mean that you are exempt from the Academicon. In fact, it may end up being more challenging in the long run.Ali (as Yashee): I think we’re already pretty far off the path of a normal student anyway.  Kyle (as Alola): That’s fair, Yashee.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ugh, this is turning into, like, less fun-time college and then like Academicon, bard college. I just want to race beds again.[Ali giggles]Spurrier (as Randy): And so we’re basically the only class that’s available to go out on this? Everyone else is busy, is what you’re saying?Kyle (as Alola): Everyone else has been on assignment which does require their abilities, and you are the only freshman class who has displayed ... ensemble magic abilities-Spurrier (as Randy): Right.Kyle (as Alola): -proficiently in some regard. So-Spurrier (as Randy): Right, right, right.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): In some regard. Goodrich: I nudge Randy. [Snickers] Kyle (as Alola): This is why I felt it necessary to contact you to see if you would be willing to … endure this task.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Question, real quick.Kyle (as Alola): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So you read our journal entry, you know what kinda happened down there.Kyle (as Alola): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, yeah. We were like way, way out of our depth. Do you know-Spurrier (as Randy): We were way, way in the depth. [Ali laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): In the depth. Out of our depth in the depth. Yes.Kyle (as Alola): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you know, Headmistress, would this be like that? ‘Cause I don’t really wanna do that again.Kyle (as Alola): This should not be like that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Should not be-Kyle (as Alola): Again, I cannot disclose the details of the mission because you are not of the level yet.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Should we choose to accept it, sort of thing.Kyle (as Alola): Exactly.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can we have a day to think about it? Is this super urgent or-Kyle (as Alola): It is super urgent.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. Like maybe-Kyle (as Alola): We would need to be going to – essentially, what is going to happen is, you will be entering the last test of what is the Academicon before you are going to be meeting your specialized instructors. Ali (as Yashee): So we just skip all the other stuff and we go right to the end?Kyle (as Alola): Yeah, essentially. And I’m able to modify this because of the dire necessity. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [quietly] Right.Kyle (as Alola): I mean, I understand. Again, if you don’t want to do this, that’s fine. Not gonna hold it against you, but I have to ask.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can we go huddle up real quick and then, you know, give us like a couple minutes?Kyle (as Alola): Please, talk amongst yourselves.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, great.Spurrier (as Randy): Before we huddle, and how soon is this last test?Kyle (as Alola): Uhh, we would probably be going straight there from here.Ali and Goodrich (as Yashee and Raz’ul): Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): So soon. Okay. Cool.Ali (as Yashee): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, yeah. We’re gonna huddle.Kyle (as Alola): Okay. Go ahead and huddle.Kyle: And she sits behind her desk and takes a moment. And she looks at a picture frame, looks away from it, and goes back to reading. But go ahead.Goodrich: Okay.Goodrich (as Raz""ul): Uh, well, hey. So if we do it, we still might wanna go by our room so you can change out of your pantsuit. We’re doing something-Ali (as Yashee): [softly] Yeah, I can barely move my arms in this.  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. So that’s obviously one thing we need to ask about.Ali (as Yashee): I’ll just tear off the arms.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, well, okay. I mean, it’s your good pant – anyways, anyways. Um. Yo, I don’t know. What do you guys think?Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, it sounds like this would kind of beef us up a little bit. Maybe we’d be more apt to handle things in the future. Like, we’re kinda fast-tracking and-Ali (as Yashee): Yep.Spurrier (as Randy): We’ve been thrown into it multiple times anyways. I’d like to have a few more skills up my sleeve; sounds like a means of doing that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, I always, uh, like a good shortcut, you know. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, sure. Uh, well, yeah, if you guys are down.Ali (as Yashee): I think so.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What the hey. Let’s do it.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. I think – okay.Ali (as Yashee): You know we can handle, like, anything.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah, yeah. Spurrier (as Randy): And plus, imagine Garreth’s face when we’ve already finished the test.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, there is that.Spurrier (as Randy): That would be worth it, just unto itself.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I wonder if there’s anything we can ask for, since we’re kinda doing her a solid. You know what I’m saying? Like-Spurrier (as Randy): You can ask if you want to.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Let’s just ask her. She seems – she seems pretty hip, pretty with it.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright.Ali (as Yashee): Okay. Alright.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright. Turn around.Ali (as Yashee): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think we’re in. But-Kyle (as Alola): Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Is there anything kinda cool we could get, or do you have it in your power to maybe, uh-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, the-Kyle (as Alola): You’re going to be getting specialized instructions earlier than any other student.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): That’s pretty cool.Kyle (as Alola): I am making a rather large exception, breaking some rules, even.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Alola): Yes, I need it, but if it comes down to it, I can always pass this up. But I don’t want to because I want to appear adept with my students, rather than having the new head of the Bureau of Better Barding assume that my students are incapable.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, yup. Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): We’re down for the sweet beef in skills. That’d be great.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah.Kyle (as Alola): Let me – let me preface: these people that you’re going to meet, these instructors, they are not necessarily official teachers of Strumlotts, like Symbol or Ms. Blackblade, like the others. Rather, they are beings who have agreed to pass on their trade secrets to our students. They will probably be finicky, and anything they deem as an undesirable personality trait – [hesitates] – might cause them to reconsider their transference of knowledge, I imagine even more so because of the sudden and unprecedented circumstances. That being said, please, be on your best behavior, if not for your own benefit, then for the benefit of Strumlotts and its future students.Spurrier (as Randy): These – are these beings from a different plane? From a different world? What are we talking?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Alola): Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Both?Kyle (as Alola): Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Plane and world? Okay. Kyle (as Alola): Mhm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. They’re not squid-like in appearance, are they?Kyle (as Alola): No, no.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [sighs] Good.Kyle (as Alola): Not that – no.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): Sounds good.Ali: I’m gonna put my arm out to shake her hand, and I smack her picture frame down.Goodrich: D’oh!Kyle: It knocks over, and she puts her hand on it and just kinda says-Kyle (as Alola):  It’s alright.Kyle: -and leaves it facedown. Goodrich: So you stuck out your hand. I’m gonna put my hand out like a-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, everyone in.Ali: Oh yeah, yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Everyone in. Ready? Uh, Headmistress, do you wanna get in on this? Randy?Spurrier (as Randy): Oh. Uh, sure.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright.Kyle: She puts her hand in.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sweet! I didn’t – yup.  Uh, “Chaos Sauce” on three? Chaos Sauce featuring Headmistress Greenspire?Ali (as Yashee): All of it? We’re gonna say all that?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Greenspire and the Sauce?Spurrier (as Randy): Greenspire and the Sauce.Ali (as Yashee): Greenspire and the Sauce. Goodrich: “Greenspire and the Sauce” on three.Players: 1, 2, 3.All: Greenspire and the Sauce!Spurrier (as Randy): Cool.Kyle (as Alola): Okay. Let’s go ahead and head on out. Is there – you’re ready to go?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yashee might need to change clothes.Ali: I just tear off the arms.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aaand we’re done.Kyle (as Alola): Alright.[Players laugh]Kyle: So you leave Alola’s office and follow her for a short while before, Randy and Raz’ul, you start to recognize this little route that you’re taking almost a little too well. But you begin descending a staircase which you know leads to the basement.Spurrier: Mmm.Kyle: For the first time, you enter the storage area without having to lie, disguise or transform yourself to do so.Spurrier: Where’s the fun in that?Kyle: [grunts]Goodrich: I was gonna say, can we do it anyways?Kyle: Yeah, you can, if you’d like to.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: What are you gonna do? You gonna lie, disguise, or transform yourself.Goodrich: Well, I think that I just cast Pass Without Trace. I think that maybe is our go-to. Maybe you disguise as Mr. Read, just for kicks.Spurrier: Maybe just for fun.Goodrich: Yeah, right.Spurrier: Just to mess with people.Goodrich: Yeah. So I guess I – I cast it, cast Pass without Trace.Kyle: Okay. You cast Pass Without Trace-Goodrich: I cast a second-level spell for no reason at all. [Hesitantly] Thanks. Kyle: Great use of it. You might not need that later. Who knows. Uh, so you cast this spell, and Randy, you transform. And of course, Alola hears magic going on. She turns around and looks at you two, and she’s like-Kyle (as Alola): What are you two doing?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [gasps] Uh, practicing.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Always be practicing, ABP.Kyle (as Alola): Alright.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s Strumlotts-Kyle (as Alola): Just – Mr. Read?Spurrier (as Randy): Uhh [chokes; Ali laughs] He’s become a favorite of mine-Kyle (as Alola): Why is-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What have you done?Spurrier (as Randy): -in my time here.Kyle (as Alola): Okay?Spurrier (as Randy): I’m inspired by him, with the Wonderballs and all.Kyle (as Alola): Wait a second. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What?Kyle (as Alola): This – you haven’t been down here, have you?Goodrich and Spurrier (as Raz’ul and Randy): Uhhhhh…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nnnnn … what’s that?[Ali laughs]Kyle: She’s not buying it. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No! Uh, what would you do if we said yes?Spurrier (as Randy): What would you do if we said [starts talking increasingly fast] we got satiated by dancing and it’s the one thing that keeps us sane on our crazy adventures we’ve had, and it makes us feel better about ourselves inside.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [also talking fast] Keep in mind, we saved a town. Spurrier (as Randy): Keep in mind-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): An entire town!Ali (as Yashee): Oh, that’s where we are!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Shut up!Ali (as Yashee): I knew this looked familiar!Kyle: She facepalms and slowly just drags, like, you know, pulling her face, and she’s like, [pause], and turns and starts walking. So-Goodrich: I nudge you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Way to freakin’ go, Mr. Read.Spurrier (as Randy): I was inspired by your spellcasting. She would have noticed.Kyle: So she walks in, leading you, and you stand before that oh-so-familiar door that leads you to your hottest spot, the basement dance club that you’ve snuck off to so many times by now. When you enter with Alola, you see Symbol standing at the entrance. He’s obviously hiding a smirk as he tries to maintain a look of seriousness. But as you enter the dance club, you notice the DJ is playing some tracks. And it’s a DJ you’ve seen a couple of times: it’s a warlock guy, his name’s Scrill Hex. Goodrich: Right! [Players laugh] Oh, yup.Kyle: But as you enter, Scrill Hex fades the current track gracefully into an electronic waltz, and the dancers that are on the floor pair off and form an aisle through which your teacher and headmistress lead you. You all make your way across the dancefloor towards the door that is guarded by the demon doorman-Ali: Ooh!Kyle: -which I’m just gonna name him Matt Demon. That seems fine.Goodrich: [snickering] Right.Kyle: But Alola gives him a nod, and he gives a nod back. The doorman licks the tip of a pointed fingernail as he turns and then begins to draw on the door in one fluid motion.Goodrich: I ask Splash-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Have you been in here? Have you ever been in here, Splash?Kyle: He just, like, looks at you and puts his finger to his lips and just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Shh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, man. Tell me about this door we’re about to go in.Kyle (as Symbol): Shh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, okay. Kyle: As Matt Demon draws, a golden magical essence lights up as he draws, creating a symbol that emits from the center, spiraling out in three directions and forming a circle that contains the three spirals. The doorman turns, nods, and the door begins to open.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Awww, yeah.Kyle: Symbol takes a moment, looks at you three, and gestures you forward.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Are you coming with?Kyle (as Symbol): Step on forward. I cannot go with you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Spurrier (as Randy): Huh.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Spurrier (as Randy): Alright.Ali (as Yashee): Let’s do this.Goodrich: Try to grab some hair real quick.[Players laugh)Kyle: You actually notice he’s got all of his hair tucked up in a hat.Goodrich: Right.[Players laugh]Kyle: Like all of his hair is tucked up in that hat, and it’s – you really can’t – it looks like he doesn’t have any hair at this point.Goodrich: Right. Okay.Kyle: But Symbol looks at you as you’re standing there before the door, and he just says-Kyle (as Symbol): I believe in you and your song. Do me proud.Kyle: And then you see that he gazes past you for a moment, through the door, and his face twists into confusion. He suddenly looks back at you, Raz’ul, un-contorting his face, and gives you a wink.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. (English accent) A wink’s as good as a nod to a blind bat, hey, Splash? Hey. Know what I mean, know what I mean. Say no more.Kyle: He chuckles a little bit, and he says-Kyle (as Symbol): Go on.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Symbol): Go on.Spurrier: And I guess I don’t look like Mr. Read at this point? I don’t -Kyle: You can still look like Mr. Read if you want to. Spurrier: No. This is for skewl, so – [Players laugh] – I’ll go back to looking like me. So yeah. Let’s hop on through.Goodrich: Does Splash say -Goodrich (as Symbol): [gasps] Randy? It was you all along!Kyle: No. He figures. He’s just like [sighs]. He kind of shakes his head when you transform out.  Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: He’s just like-Kyle (as Symbol): Ehh, alright.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye, Splash.Spurrier (as Randy): Bye.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): See you on the other side?Kyle (as Symbol): Okay.Kyle: And he gives another wink.Goodrich: Okay. Uh.Ali (as Yashee): That’s getting weird.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Stop it, Splash.Ali (as Yashee): Bye.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Bye.Kyle: So you turn to face the door, and you see a stone room that is well-lit by sconces on the wall. There’s a single pedestal in the middle of the room that is set at the center of the same symbol the doorman drew to open the door. Behind this is a ten-foot-tall bronze statue of a Halfling playing a lute, which you recognize to be Barenthall Strumlott. The air in the room is musty like a grandparent’s attic, and flecks of dust float through the air. Would you like to enter the room?Spurrier: Yes.Ali: Sure.Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Psyching myself up.Kyle: Getting ready.Ali: Close spaces and all.Goodrich: I pat you on the arm.Ali (as Yashee): [in an undertone] I can do this. Alright. Let’s go, let’s do this.Goodrich: -on your wrist, like, you got it, it’s alright. Remember what Randy said, it’s for skewl.Kyle: You enter the room and the door behind you closes, then fades away. The symbol on the floor lights up, the brightest part at the center of the three individual spirals. The statue begins to move and strums the lute, then begins to speak:Kyle (as Barenthall): [very loudly] Welcome, students-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aaaah![Ali giggles]Kyle (as Barenthall): -and congratulations on taking your next step at Strumlott’s School of Barding. Before you are assigned to your individual colleges, you have one more test. You will need to answer both riddles through the song you perform, which should contain, reference, or discuss the answer. Are you ready for the riddle?Ali (as Yashee): Yes!Spurrier (as Randy): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I love Barenthall Strumlott. Yes! Kyle (as Barenthall): I love you too. [Players laugh] Riddle number one: I can be cracked, I can be made, I can be told, and I can be played. What am I? Riddle number two: You will hear me again and again, whether in music or in war. What am I? When you are ready to perform your answers, each of you step into one of the three spirals of the triskelion. Let me know when you’re ready to play.Kyle: Let’s go ahead and roll some chord dice.Goodrich: Oh boy!Ali: Okay.[Music transitions]Kyle: Alright, rolling up the chord dice. Wait, do we wanna choose major or minor first? Rah?Goodrich: Let’s do major.Ali: Yeah.Goodrich: Start this-Ali: This should be a happy occasion.Spurrier: We’re trying to succeed, yeah.Ali: We’re learning so much.Goodrich: What about time signature?Ali: Uh, I’m thinking just, you know, regular ol’-Goodrich: Regular 4.Spurrier: After the 5 adventure.Goodrich: You don’t wanna go-Kyle: It got wild last time.Ali: Yeah, yeah. We don’t need to shove it all into-Goodrich: You don’t wanna do 3? You don’t wanna do 3? You don’t wanna do 3?Ali: I love a good 3.Goodrich: But it’s the three of us! Ali: You know what?Goodrich: Okay, we’ll do 4.[Multiple dice rolls]Ali: Oh, I got a wild!Spurrier: I got a wild as well.[Two dice rolls]Goodrich: Wow. Alright. Two E minors, a D minor, and B diminished. Spurrier: And C.Goodrich: And C.Ali: B, C, D, E. Wow!Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: Dr-dr-dr-drum roll!Ali: Alright. The coin toss. [Tosses coin] Tails. Great. [Rolls dice] And we’ve got fourteen, which is Techno 7.Goodrich: Alright.Ali: We’re already on a great path.Goodrich: We’re in the dance club.Ali: Alright. And the kit [rolls dice] is fifty-five.Kyle: Shfifty-five-Goodrich: Shfifty-five, my kills, fifty-five. Girlfriend’s age?Kyle: Shfifty-five.Ali: This is rock-Goodrich: You must pay.Ali: Rock 02.Kyle: Rock 02.Ali: Shfifty shfifty.[Players laugh]Kyle: Five times five times five times five is shfifty.Goodrich: Alrighty! Real quick before we go, can you give us the answers?Kyle: Nope. Ali: Er!Spurrier: Oh boy.Goodrich: Alright. See ya!Kyle: Listeners, talk to you in a second.[Music transitions]Kyle: Alright. Hey everyone, it’s your dungeon maestro Kyle here, just wanting to give you another thank you for joining us and listening to our podcast and, you know, just coming back time after time to enjoy our adventure. Uh, we have two big things coming up for us: September 18, which is next week, we’re dropping Chaos Sauce Vol. 2, so that’s gonna be the collections of songs from Episode 11 up to Episode 20. That’ll be on our Bandcamp, so just pop over there. You can download them, have them on your phone, you don’t have to go through the podcast to listen to them. And then a little bit further down the pipeline, on October 2, we’re gonna be releasing the BomBARDed OST Vol. 2. So Spurrier’s going back through, picking a bunch of the tracks that he really enjoyed from episodes 11 through 20, and we’re gonna upload that for you to have downloadable as well. Bombarded.bandcamp.com, you’re gonna see those coming up in the next month, so keep a lookout.So also, yesterday, the – DND released the Podcasts of Waterdeep, and that’s a ten-episode continuous story featuring, uh, a handful of just great DND podcasts. You have, like, the Broadswords, the Venture Maidens – which I actually played with. You have You Meet in a Tavern, you have Godsfall. So a bunch of people came together and put together this ten-episode story. I got to play with the Venture Maidens; I took Tabitha out of my world and brought it into theirs. And of course, that’s just getting ready for the whole Heists of Waterdeep book that Wizards of the Coast is putting out. So again, that dropped yesterday. If you wanna check that out. I played with the Venture Maidens one, but listen to them all, ‘cause it’s gonna be – ah! It’s just – it was wild. It was great. So check that out. You can find that at dnd.wizards.com/articles/events/podcasts-waterdeep.Okay. Also, I am taking part in a stream with a group called Nontoxic Gaming – you can find them on Twitter at @NontoxicGaming – and they are grouping with Checkpoint, which is a nonprofit connecting games and gamers with mental health resources. We’re doing a 24-hour stream on September 15. My group that I’m DMing, we’re gonna be the first ones to kick it off. That’s gonna start at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. So they got this group of people together, and it’s just – it’s a charity. We’re gonna be having events on there where you can make donations to affect outcomes of dice rolls, whether it’s going in favor of the players or in favor of the DM, and that’s gonna be happening for a whole twenty-four hours. Be sure to check that out. It’s gonna be held at twitch.tv/TeamNTG. Again, that’s twitch.tv/TeamNTG. That’s on September 15, and we’re gonna have a blast. So come check us out, come help us raise some money for this awesome organization, and just enjoy some good old-fashion DND and other tabletop role-playing games that some others should be bringing to the table.Alright, that’s all I got for ya. Don’t forget, @BombardedCast on social media; #BardCast for any post; check out our website, BombardedCast.com; and go to our Bandcamp, bombarded.bandcamp.com. Let’s get back to the action [Music transitions]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, Mr. Strumlotts?Kyle (as Barenthall): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think we – [laughs] – I think we have the answer.Kyle (as Barenthall): Step inside the circles of the triskelion and play.Goodrich: Oh.Ali: Oh.Goodrich: We do that, I guess.Kyle (as Barenthall): Good!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Here we go.[Music begins]Goodrich, Spurrier, and Ali: [singing] Hot and sweaty, Symbol’s ready, going to the pool and feelin’ heady, jumps off the board and does a spin, what does he make when he jumps in? A splash. Splash! A splash. Splash!Got a rumbling in the tummy, Symbol’s gonna whip up something yummy, spicy chili will hit the spot, so how much hot sauce goes in the pot? A splash. Splash! A splash. Splash![As song ends, a cymbal is struck]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, so did you catch all that, Mr. Strumlotts?Kyle (as Barenthall): I think I got it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. So can be cracked, made, told, and played, we thought was a joke.Ali (as Yashee): A joke.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, alright.Kyle (as Barenthall): Okay. Those were jokes, I guess. Inside jokes are still jokes! Haha!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. [Laughs] You get it? Splash and- Kyle (as Barenthall): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Then, anyways, if you hear it in music and in war again and again, we were thinking a can(n)on.Kyle (as Barenthall): That is correct!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes!Ali (as Yashee): Alright!Spurrier (as Randy): Yay!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nailed it! Did you hear the canon?Kyle: And he strums out the “Love Your Mother.""Goodrich: Oh, yep![Electric guitar chords]Kyle (as Barenthall): Correct! Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ahh!Spurrier (as Randy): Yessss!Kyle (as Barenthall): Great job!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Awesome!Kyle (as Barenthall): Now, for the next part.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh jeez.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Barenthall): I will need to converse with you each privately. Place a hand on the pedestal and recite the incantation written on it in your mind to activate my [drops voice to a stage whisper] whisper mode. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do we do it all at once or one at a time?Kyle (as Barenthall): [Loudly again] Do it!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): All at once or one at a time?Kyle (as Barenthall): It doesn’t matter.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Could I talk to a real person?[Players laugh]Kyle (as Barenthall): No.Ali: Customer service!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Customer service!Ali (as Yashee): Customer service!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, okay.Kyle (as Barenthall): Place your hand on the pedestal and recite the incantation-[Overlapping conversation]Goodrich: Alright, all three of us. Here we go. One, two, three – [grunts with exertion].Kyle: Okay. And Raz’ul, here you are. Yashee, here you are. Randy, you don’t get one.Goodrich: Oh.Spurrier: Oh, right. Okay.Goodrich: Okay. So this is what’s written on the pedestal?Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Okay.Ali: Okay.Goodrich: So-Ali: And thinking in three.Goodrich: Alright. Three, two, one, [grunts in exertion].Kyle (as Barenthall): You, smallest one.Spurrier (as Randy): Hi.Kyle (as Barenthall): Why are you not speaking the incantation in your mind?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Speak the incantation, man.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, hang on one second.Spurrier: I lean over to Raz’ul and whisper-Spurrier (as Randy): We can talk about this later, but could you just tell me what it says, super quick? Just whisper it to me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh.Spurrier (as Randy): Just fast, fast, fast.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, okay. “What is spoken is for my ear and is not for others to hear.”Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you.Spurrier: Alright, I think that.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I – you- Spurrier (as Randy): We’ll talk about it later.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Ready?Goodrich and Spurrier (as Raz’ul and Randy): One, two, three. [Grunt in exertion]Goodrich: [whispering] What is spoken for my ear is not for others to hear.Kyle: Okay. You all hear the same thing that I’m about to say now, which is-Kyle (as Barenthall): You have not gone through the Academicon proper, so I have not had a chance to assess your abilities like I normally would. Based on the limited information provided by the school, I can make suggestions; otherwise, you can tell me what college you would choose, why, and what you can offer to further the reputation of that college. The colleges available are: Lore, Valor, Glamour, Swords, and Whispers.Goodrich: Press 4 for Swords, 5 for Whispers.Kyle: And listeners, to let you know, those are the five colleges which you can find between the regular Player’s Handbook and Xanthar’s Guide to Everything.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: So those are just the bard colleges available once you hit Level 3, so - and I’ve asked you three to think about what you wanna do-Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: -where you wanna go with your characters.Goodrich: Yeah, we were like, “After that, Kyle, we’re gonna level up, right?”Kyle: No, you’re never leveling up again. So let me roll to see who goes first. Let’s see. [Rolls dice] Okay, we’ll start with Raz’ul. That’s the roll.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: So Raz’ul, you hear in your mind, the statue go:Kyle (as Barenthall): Hmm. So, Raz’ul Daz’ulson. A dwarf prince. Hmmm…mmmm…mmmm. Okay. [Players laugh] Goodrich: Jeez.Kyle (as Barenthall): Your people idolize your ancestors as paragons, keeping their memories alive through retelling tales of their achievements. Perhaps-Goodrich: This guy can read my freaking mind and past?Kyle (as Barenthall): Perhaps you’d find a home in the College of Valor, being in the front line of some of the most historical moments, fighting alongside champions and capturing the details of glorious battles in verse so others can hear tales of wonder and excitement. What do you think?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, Mr. Strumlott, sir-Kyle (as Barenthall): Yes! Goodrich (as Raz’ul): With all due respect, um, when I was kinda looking over all the classes … in class – you know, in all my free time – I kinda liked the College of Glamour.Kyle (as Barenthall): Hmmm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Because they’re, you know, like super awesome. They’re not just extra, they’re like nextra.Kyle (as Barenthall): Okay.[Players laugh]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s what I was calling them. Anyways, and I don’t know. I did this cool thing not too long ago, where, like, I cast big ol’ Moonbeam and it felt real good and there was all this light and super cool. And I thought maybe I could incorporate that into my spells and stuff. And, I don’t know, it sounds really cool. I’m not super charismatic right now anyways, and I thought that would help, maybe. I think I got it in me, is what I’m saying. Kyle (as Barenthall): So you’re saying your lack of charisma could be compensated by being admitted into this college? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, no, no. I think that I have the charisma inside of me, and it’s just waiting to bubble over and burst out into the world, but I just need some training as to-Kyle (as Barenthall): Hmm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): -how to release it.Kyle (as Barenthall): That sounds like a much better reasoning. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Barenthall): I’m listening.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): See, that’s case in point, man: I’ve got it in me, I’ve just gotta know how to get it out.Goodrich: Can I do Moonbeam for him, so I can show him what I did?Kyle: If you want to cast Moonbeam, you can.Goodrich: Alright. I do that, and I cast Moonbeam and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): In the name of the moon, I will impress you. Goodrich: And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Moon Raz’ul Magic!Goodrich: And I do the big moonbeam.Kyle: Okay. The column of light comes down like it normally does.Goodrich: I don’t cast it on him, though! Holy crap! No, I-Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: -just off to the side.Kyle: Just off to the side?Goodrich: [Laughing] Yes.Kyle (as Barenthall): Interesting. So, you would like to be in the spotlight and be able to charm people into following you or listening to you, and being more persuasive of sorts. I think you have a pretty good method of at least creating a spotlight for yourself.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, there he is, yeah.Kyle (as Barenthall): So…it is considered.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Cool. Is that a soft yes? What does that mean?[Ali and Goodrich giggle]Kyle (as Barenthall): I will allow it. I still think you would be better in the College of Valor, but-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uhh…Kyle (as Barenthall): If this is what you want, why not?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Laughs uneasily] Spoken like a true bard. Thanks, doc. Got it.Kyle: Alright. And again, these conversations are all happening at the same time in each of your heads, so let’s see who we’re gonna go with next. (Rolls dice) And that is going to be Yashee.Goodrich: That thunder was crazy. I really wish it would’ve happened when I cast Moonbeam! Oh my gosh!Ali: Dang.Goodrich: Dang.Ali: You should have just stopped talking there and then pasted it in.Kyle: So, Yashee, you hear the statue talking inside your head.Kyle (as Barenthall): Yashe’rak Bordun.Ali (as Yashee): Hello?Kyle (as Barenthall): Hello. There is another Bordun that came through here once a while back. He had quite the wandering spirit, which I sense in you as well.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, that was my dad!Kyle (as Barenthall): Excellent. Perhaps with you and your travelin’ bone, it seems the College of Lore would suit you: gathering tales wherever you roam, from dusted shelf to dilapidated crypt, gaining secret knowledge both mundane and magical. You could unearth tales long forgotten, and bring them to people who would never know these glorious stories. What say you?Ali (as Yashee): You know, I hear where you’re coming from, um, and I-Kyle (as Barenthall): Your mind.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, you know. And that’s certainly something that, like, I enjoyed doing, you know, with my parents, but, um, I think I’d actually rather go the Swords route.Kyle (as Barenthall): Hmm, College of Blades. You look to entertain with your blade, but be deadly with it at the same time. Of course, they are called Blades, but any weapon should work as long as you’re able to perform with it.Ali (as Yashee): I mean, I’ll get a blade if I need to, but … Kyle (as Barenthall): I don’t see it necessary.Ali (as Yashee): I really like my hammers. Kyle (as Barenthall): You can use your hammers, as they are your instrument as well. Which, that’s the thing, is performing with them. The blade becomes – or the weapon becomes – an instrument in and of itself, to perplex and capture the attention of your foe. Be deadly aware of how close you get to them, therefore they will not know what is coming. What would you bring to the table for this college to help their namesake? Ali (as Yashee): I mean, I’m already a, you know, a great, uh, fighter. I like that stuff.Kyle (as Barenthall): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): I’m pretty good at it, I think, so-Goodrich: [Laughing] I’m pretty good at a fight. That’s your reasoning?Ali (as Yashee): So, you know, learning some cool tricks with my weapons might help people … hmm.Kyle (as Barenthall): Mmmm. There is information coming in. [Goodrich snickers] You had spoken to the headmistress about wanting to diversify away from your previous path to something new. [Ali squawks] Are you sure this is the right way that you want to go?Ali (as Yashee): [pauses] Yep.Kyle (as Barenthall): Okay. [Players laugh] You are a big, strong, muscly person-Ali (as Yashee): Thanks.Kyle (as Barenthall): -and I think you would do well. [Goodrich giggles] I will permit it.Goodrich: Score.Ali (as Yashee): Thank you.Goodrich: He’s like the most laidback dude. He’s like, “Ah well, too bad. Okay. Let’s do what you wanna do.”Kyle: And-Goodrich: And so, Kyle, when I cast my Moonbeam, you said all of this is going on in our mind?Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: So when I cast my Moonbeam, it was just, like, out in the middle of-Kyle: No. Yeah, it just came out of nowhere and it’s in the middle of the room.Goodrich: Freakin’ RKO’d you guys with a freakin’ Moonbeam out of nowhere!Kyle: Last but not least, we have Randy.Kyle (as Barenthall): Randy Greentrees.Spurrier (as Randy): Mhm.Kyle (as Barenthall): You are a quiet fellow, commanding attention not with your voice, but with your actions. Your deftness with the blade would suit you well going into the College of Swords, stunning your audience through death-defying stunts with your weapons. Your entertainment would be a façade to your true talent. Any enemy that finds themself as your audience would run if they knew the truth behind your mesmerizing performance. Perhaps this would work for you?Spurrier (as Randy): That does sound awesome: just getting my schnickety-schnake on and getting my Wolverine Weapon X and that’s super cool. Kyle (as Barenthall): What’s a wolverine?Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, you’ve seen them out there, right? You’ve got druid friends.Kyle (as Barenthall): I am a statue in a room.[Players laugh]Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. You used to be a person, right?Kyle (as Barenthall): I – okay, I’m not going there, but-Spurrier (as Randy): It’s getting deep. Well, anyways, while my snickety-snick would be cool, you said it yourself: I’m not one to speak a lot. The College of Whispers was looking pretty nice.Kyle (as Barenthall): Yes, subterfuge.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Kyle (as Barenthall): Getting inside people’s minds and spreading dissent. Perhaps this is would be a good college for you. What about you as a person would bring glory to the College of Whispers? Spurrier (as Randy): I’ve run with a pretty rough crowd. I’m actually a rogue. You probably knew that; you seem like you’ve got some sweet mind powers. Kyle (as Barenthall): I read only the information that has been given to me by the school.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh. Maybe they know that, I’m not really sure. Hmm. Goodrich: I guess that’ll work.Spurrier (as Randy): Regardless, I am a rogue, and, you know, a little bit of lyin', a little bit of cheatin',  little bit of thievin', little bit of, you know, this that and the other. Did you know your school sells cheater’s dice at the commissary? [Goodrich laughs] It’s-Kyle (as Barenthall): I am a statue in a room. No.Spurrier (as Randy): I wasn’t sure how clued in you were on, like, what’s going on since you’ve gone to a different plane.Goodrich: There’s a sweet dance club too.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. But I’m already kinda taking advantage of what the school has to offer in terms of that kind of stuff. And, you know, I know that it doesn’t have the highest reputation of a college, so kinda got a Slytherin vibe to it, which is fine. Um-Kyle (as Barenthall): What’s a Slytherin?Spurrier (as Randy): Once again, you know, you’ve been fed the information. I know you guys got the HP in the library. Mr. Reads got a good- Kyle (as Barenthall): Oh, there it is!Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah.Goodrich: Searching-Goodrich and Spurrier: Searching.Spurrier: There it is. Spurrier (as Randy): Fed that in. Enjoy that.But yeah. So I wouldn’t mind getting my hands dirty for the school.Kyle (as Barenthall): College of Whispers it is.Spurrier (as Randy): [Whispering] Yes.Goodrich: Wow, Barenthall goes 0 for 3 on placing bards in colleges. Kyle: Again, he said he’d only make suggestions based off information given to him.Ali: Well, and, I think at the beginning, he said like, “You haven’t gone through the Academicon,” right?Goodrich: Right.Ali: He didn’t have all the info.Kyle: Yeah, so normally he’d have an opportunity to observe you further, if you had done the full Academicon.Goodrich: Gotcha.Kyle: So at this moment, all these conversations happen, and randomly, Raz’ul casts Moonbeam out of nowhere.Goodrich: I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, I panicked. Sorry. Ali: I step away a little bit.Ali (as Yashee): Ow. It’s singeing me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, my bad.Kyle: But at this point, the statue speaks out loud and says:Kyle (as Barenthall): So it is decided. Please, proceed through your door.Kyle: And on the right side of the room, you see three doors appear, each with a silhouette on them: one juggling swords, one whispering into an ear, and one standing on a stage. Kyle (as Barenthall): Please, proceed through your door to meet your instructor.Spurrier (as Randy): Cool.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey, so real quick. Uh, why didn’t you read that thing, dude?Spurrier (as Randy): I said – look, we’re in the middle of something.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh my gosh.Ali (as Yashee): This is not the time-Spurrier (as Randy): I said that later-Ali (as Yashee): -but we want to know, for sure.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Spurrier (as Randy): We’ll chat it up, later.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): We’ve got doors.Goodrich: Alright. I chose College of Glamour; I don’t know what you guys chose.Ali (as Yashee): I’m Swords.Spurrier (as Randy): I’m Whispers.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Sweet. Alright.Ali (as Yashee): Let’s do it.Goodrich: Okay. And go. Bye, Barenthall!Kyle (as Barenthall): Goodbye!Kyle: Okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We’ll maybe see you again.Kyle (as Barenthall): I doubt it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle: You walk through each of your doors. Yashee. You open your door, and you see a craggy red landscape. There’s hellfire all around. [Goodrich giggles] And you walk in, and you hear the sounds of gears turning. Two objects whiz past you on these unicycles. You can’t get a good look at them, but they stop and stand in front of you on these things, just balancing. And you see two fiendish looking creatures, and they’re juggling swords between each other. And they look at you, and they say in unison:Kyle (as fiends): Yashe’rak Bordun, we will be your instructors of the College of Swords and impart our knowledge upon you. We are Counter and Point.Goodrich: Oh my gosh.Ali (as Yashee): Nice to meet you. I’m excited to be in your college. I’m so excited to learn. Can I do that? I wanna do that. Kyle (as Counter and Point): We will see.Ali (as Yashee): Great.Goodrich: Man, I really wish it was Point and Counterpoint, ‘cause I just saw Streetlight Manifesto and it was so good! [Players laugh]Kyle: Sorry man.Ali: It’s too lateGoodrich: Ah, that’s fair.Kyle: Okay, Raz’ul.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: You walk through your door, Goodrich: Yup.Kyle: And you walk into a wooded grove. There are Dancing Lights all around, and you hear the sound of a fife. And you see a creature sitting on a log, and there’s another person sitting next to him, much larger and taller. But you hear this fife playing, and as you walk in, the two people turn. And you see Symbol, sitting next to a satyr man.Goodrich: Whaaaaaat!?Kyle: And he’s looking at you, and the satyr kinda whispers into Symbol’s ear, and Symbol kinda laughs. And the satyr stands up, and he says:Kyle (as satyr): Raz’ul Daz’ulson, I am Phil Harmonic.Goodrich: Yes.Kyle (as Phil): I’m gonna be your teacher in the College of Glamour. Let’s see if you have what it takes to shine.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jazz hands?Kyle (as Phil): Jazz hands.Goodrich: Does Splash say anything?Kyle: Splash is just smiling and-Goodrich: Uh!Kyle: -gives you another wink.Goodrich: I wink back. I totally wink back this time. And I say- Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I think we’re gonna have a great time, Splash.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, we will. Meet my teacher.Goodrich: Ohohohoh! What!?Kyle: Randy.  Spurrier: Oh boy.Kyle: You walk into a room, and it’s dark, damp, and you begin hearing whispers. And you look in the corner of the room, and you see a shadow moving about, and it’s just this shaded figure. And you hear – it’s like somebody is right next to your ear, and you hear-Kyle (as voice): [in stage whisper] Randy Greentrees.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, hi.Kyle (as voice): I will be your instructor in the College of Whispers.Spurrier (as Randy): You’re really close.Kyle (as voice): I’m not, actually.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh.Kyle (as voice): I’m actually maybe not even in this room.Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, that’s really cool too. Alright.Kyle (as voice): But I will teach you to influence things in this way. I am your teacher, [voice drops to an actual whisper] Pianissimo.[Goodrich and Ali giggle]Spurrier (as Randy): Oooh.Kyle: And we’re gonna stop there. We’re gonna pick up next time, and you’re all gonna learn your first abilities in your new colleges.[Theme music fades in]Spurrier: My teacher’s name is Peepee.[Everyone laughs]"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/ep-24-swords-whispers-and-glamour,"Ep. 24 - Swords, Whispers, and Glamour","Ep. 24 - Swords, Whispers, and Glamour[Episode opens with the sound of the Petzold minuet discussed in Episode 22 being played using the “hey” sound effects. Players are laughing at various points, and Goodrich tries to sing along.]Spurrier: And so on.[Theme music plays]Kyle: Hey everyone. Welcome back to BomBARDed. Let’s recap last episode real quick. It’s gonna be a quick one, because our bards started off by being – they were in their room and Symbol came by, told them “hey, you need to go talk to – go talk to Alola. Went down, talked to Alola. You got the skinny on a group that’s called the Tubular Phunk Karate.Goodrich: Is it the Tubular Phunk Karate or Tubular-Kyle: No, no. It’s just Tubular Phunk Karate. I misspoke.Goodrich: They’d be pretty pissed about not getting it.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Just kidding.Kyle: No, no, no. Just Tubular Phunk Karate, Phunk with a Ph. So you heard about this group, and you didn’t – Alola didn’t want to tell you any more than that, just because there’s information that you have to be at a certain level, as far as being in bard college, to be privy to it. So – but she did mention that they could go ahead and put you in your colleges and get you assigned, because all the other upperclassmen had been already assigned and were out to their adventure. So really, she’s asking for a favor out of you three, and after a little bit of talking back and forth, you decided that, sure, why not, we can give you a helping hand. And Alola took you down to the basement to start the end of the Academicon. Of course, you’re skipping most of the Academicon proper and just getting to the meat of it, which is getting assigned to your colleges. You enter the same old dancehall that you’ve entered many times, snuck off to, and there was a nice little, almost seemed ceremonial in a sense as you walked through and were led to the door that, Yashee, you were turned away from, you know, in, like, what was it, Episode 5?Goodrich: Something.Spurrier: Around there, yeah.Kyle: Around there, with the first time you were in the dance – in the club.Spurrier: Yeah.Kyle: You got turned away from the door.Spurrier: Yep.Kyle: The door was actually opened up to you, and led you into a room where you saw a statue, a large statue of Barenthall Strumlotts, and you were told this is where it begins. You entered into the room, and Barenthall greeted you and let you know, if you were going to be placed into your colleges, first you must solve this riddle through performance. Luckily, you were able to solve that riddle quite well.Goodrich: Aww, yeah!Kyle: I actually really enjoyed your song.Goodrich: Splash. [Everyone laughs]Kyle: Inside jokes.Goodrich: You really enjoyed us. Every time we were just like, “Is this it, Kyle?”, he was like, ""Gah, leave me alone!”   Kyle: Yeah, sure.Goodrich: “Go away.”Kyle: But it was after succeeding at this riddle that Barenthall took a moment to have a little bit of a one-on-one, all at the same time – as weird as that is – had a one-on-one with you to decide, you know, which college would you fit in best? And after, you know, chatting and getting to know you, you all landed in your own individual colleges: Yashee in the College of Swords-Ali: Yeah.Kyle: Randy, you’re in the College of Whispers-Spurrier: Yes.Kyle: And Raz’ul, you’re in the College of Glamour.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: We left off with you each meeting your teachers and them introducing themselves, so we’re gonna pick up there. And I think I’m gonna start with Yashee.Ali: Okay.Kyle: Let’s pick up there. Again, you’re in this craggy hellscape of a land. You have your two teachers, Counter and Point, standing in front of you, both of them wearing sleek, flashy, but demonic-looking jester’s outfits. They both look at you, then shoot a sideways glance at each other, and they bring their hands to their mouth and stifle a laugh.Goodrich: Uh.Ali: Rude.Goodrich: I mean-[Players laugh]Kyle: Do you say this out loud?Ali: Um – [players giggle] – no, I’ll go-Ali (as Yashee): What’s so funny? What’s the joke? I love jokes.Kyle: They reply:Kyle (as Counter and Point): There is no joke, Yashee. We are excited to work with somebody of your build. You’re much larger than the people we normally work with; normally, people who come through the College of Swords are … more compact.Kyle: And-Ali: I – Yashee flexes a little. She’s very proud of her muscles.Kyle: And they both – their eyes light up-Ali: Uh-huh.Kyle: -and you can see like a small flame in their eye.Ali: I light up too.Kyle: And they’re just like:Kyle (as Counter and Point): So we have some things to take care of. First, Yashee, are you wanting to be a duelist – are you wanting to gain an edge of when using a single instrument of combat?Kyle: They both draw their swords and begin fencing as they talk, but then draw a second sword and begin to battle fiercely with each other.Kyle (as Counter and Point): Or perhaps you are a dual-wielder rather than a duelist. We can’t deny that two are better than one.Kyle: -they look at each other and both smile- Kyle (as Counter and Point): Well, what do you say?Ali (as Yashee): Well, I do have my maul, and I use that occasionally, but I – I really prefer my hammer mallets.Ali: And I take them out and I try to spin them and drop them. [Other players giggle]Ali (as Yashee): This is why I need your help.Kyle (as Counter and Point): Hmm, okay. So you have mallets, not blades.Ali (as Yashee): No. Kyle (as Counter and Point): Okay.Ali (as Yashee): I think I have like a –Ali: [far from microphone] I have something.Ali (as Yashee): Nope. I’ve got nothing here. You know, I dropped a knife once while I was, like, cutting some bread when I was a kid, and I don’t know. I can’t be around them anymore.Goodrich: Ever since then.Ali (as Yashee): I do like spoons though, so if you have any spoon tricks-Kyle (as Counter and Point): No spoon tricks.Ali (as Yashee): -I have plenty of-  Kyle (as Counter and Point): -but we can definitely work with your mallets. Uh, but one second.Kyle: And they look bemused after looking at your hammers. They’ve just been staring at your hammers after you pulled them out. And they turn their backs to you and huddle up, and they start to whisper. They kinda look over their shoulder at you a little bit, and they turn back and their faces are both beaming. And one begins to speak separately, and you hear them say:Kyle (as Counter/Point): Okay. So your hammers look marvelous. Quite nice, quite nice. I think we could do this. Yes, I think we could. We should. If she will let us, we can. We can, and she should. Hand us your mallets, please.Ali (as Yashee): Uhhh … okay.Kyle: Okay. So you hand your mallets over to them, and they take them, and they start pulling leather straps out of a bag that they have, and they are fixing those leather straps to the handle of your mallets. And these leather straps actually create loops at the end of your mallets. They hand them back to you, and they say:Kyle (as Counter and Point): Okay. Prepare yourself for an amazing act, not yet crowd-tested, but it’s sure to exemplify our intent. Kyle: They both draw two swords each, all swords having a leather loop hanging from their hilt, similar to what they did with your mallets. They place their hands through the loops and let the swords hang from their wrists. They begin to dance in an exotic maneuvers [sic] and manipulate the swords to start swinging around, and as they do, they move nimbly across the ground, the blades sometimes coming within an inch of hitting their wielders. Counter and point get in sync with each other, and they face you and begin to approach. What do you do? Ali: Um, okay. Well, I’ll try to do what they’re doing with the swords with my hammers. So I’ll stick the, I guess, loops on my wrists?Kyle: Okay.Ali: I’m just gonna start swinging them in front.Kyle: Okay.Ali: I’m not very good at it yet.Kyle Roll a performance check real quick.   Ali: Here I go. [Rolls dice] That is a seventeen plus five.Kyle: Yeah. You’re able to deftly swing these hammer mallets around, despite it being your first time. You kind of watch them and see what they’re doing, and you’re mimicking that really well. And they’re actually – their smiles get bigger than you thought they would already be, but they’re just like-Kyle (as Counter and Point): Yes! Excellent, Yashee! Okay. You’re getting that. So you’re gonna be learning three flourishes. Ready yourself, and pay attention to how we maneuver our weapons, as this will be the best and probably coolest way to utilize these maneuvers. Are you ready?  Ali (as Yashee): Yes.Kyle: Counter begins speaking, and she says:Kyle (as Counter): First, the defensive flourish. I will attack you using the defensive flourish, and Point is going to attack me from behind. Watch closely as I deflect his attack with the follow-through of my attack on you.Kyle: And before you even realize it, Counter’s sword has lashed out and barely grazed you across the chest. And it comes back around, and you see Point go in for an attack behind Counter. And the sword swings around and actually hits Point’s sword out of the way.Ali: Oh.Kyle: Deflecting. He’s like:Kyle (as Point): Okay. So as you can see, this maneuver allows you to up your defense, in a sense, by placing your weapons in places that assailants would not think they would be.Ali (as Yashee): Well, that’s great. That happens all the time.Kyle (as Counter/Point): Excellent. [Players laugh] Well, now, you try.Ali (as Yashee): Oh. Alright.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle (as Counter/Point): You try.Ali: My hammers. So on the hammers, is it just like – like how long is the strap? Like, can – is it just right in front of me, or can I kind of like throw the weapon and pull it back?Kyle: You would be able to throw the weapon out and pull it back by the leather strap that it’s on.Ali: Mhm.Kyle: So yeah. We’ll say – there is a feature for weapons in the Player’s Handbook that’s called Reach, and it pretty much says you can reach a little bit further – I think it’s up to ten feet. But we’ll say that your mallets now have that ability.Ali: Well, cool.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Okay. So I roll two D20s now, like one for each hammer?Kyle: Yeah, since you’re two-weapon fighting.Ali: And then add them onto both and then do damage roll for both.Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Cool. Okay. So – [rolls dice] – first one was nineteen plus six, so-Kyle: [giggles] Yes, that hits.Ali: Okay. And the other is six plus six, twelve.Kyle: That hits as well.Ali: Okay. So now I roll for damage.Kyle: Yeah.[Dice roll]Ali: Uh, one is a two plus three, so five; and one is a ten.Kyle: Okay. So ten total. And roll your bardic inspiration dice to figure out how much damage you’re adding and how much you’re upping your AC. Ali: Okay. Since this is training, do I have to use one of my inspiration die?Kyle: No.Ali: Okay.Kyle: You’ll roll the inspiration dice, but you’re not using it officially. Ali: Okay. So inspiration die – [rolls dice] – that is a six, ding ding!Spurrier: Nice.Kyle: Oh, nice. Alright. So-Ali: So my AC will be eighteen for the, quote/unquote, next whatever.Kyle: Yeah, absolutely. And when you do that, Counter is a little taken aback by the hit. That’s a pretty hard hit; you did twenty-one damage.Ali: They’re used to working with little, what, feeble people, like they said before, you know.Kyle: Yeah, exactly. So-Ali: I caught them off guard.Kyle: Yeah, your mallets go and they just batter into Counter, and Counter kinda like Kyle (as Counter): Uh! [Coughs]Ali: Like-Ali (as Yashee): Oh, sorry. Sorry. I didn’t mean to hit you that hard, buddy.Kyle (as Counter): [hoarse and struggling for air] It’s okay.[Goodrich laughs]Kyle: And Point comes in with an attack, but you’re swinging your mallet around, and let’s see. Point - [rolls dice] – does not do well. You swing your mallet around, and you’re able to see Point in the corner of your eye, just in your peripheral. And you swing your mallet around just in time, enough to just bat his blades away.Ali: Yes. [Giggles]Kyle: So – and Counter kind of recomposes herself and says:Kyle (as Counter): [still gasping for air] Well, um, that was very different. Uh, uh, great job.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, I like this.Kyle (as Counter): Nicely done. Um-Ali (as Yashee): This is gonna be great.Kyle (as Counter): Um, Point, will you take this next one?[Goodrich giggles]Kyle: And Point chimes in and says:Kyle (as Point): The next flourish is your slashing flourish, which is beneficial when multiple hostiles are in close combat with you. With this flourish, your follow-through will be intended for hitting a nearby target rather than protecting yourself, but it is the performance that you put into the attack that will determine if your secondary foe is caught off guard. This time, I will attack with Counter nearby to act as my secondary foe. Let me school you real quick.Kyle: Point begins swinging their weapons again, and attacks in the same way that Counter did. And the weapon just comes so quickly and it barely grazes you, and follows through and actually hits Counter.  And Counter winds up-Kyle (as Counter): [still winded] Okay.[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Seriously.Kyle (as Counter): This is a little much. But you’re – you’re understanding what we’re saying, right?Kyle: And Point is just like-Ali (as Yashee): Yeah, I think I got it.Kyle (as Point): Okay. Now you. Hit me and follow through to hit Counter.Kyle (as Counter): No, no, no, the other way around, please.Ali (as Yashee): I’ll try – I’ll try to pull back a little, okay?Kyle (as Counter): No, that’s – that’s fine. Please, don’t – don’t hold back. Ali: So rolling again. [Rolls two dice] Oh my, oh my gosh. Uh, I think it’s almost the same numbers from last time. So a twenty-five and a twelve.Kyle: Yeah. Those both hit.Ali: Mhm. I know. [Players laugh]Kyle: Okay. So you do your initial damage – who are you going to attack first? They both said, you know, “Attack me, then follow on to the other one. Attack me, then follow on to the other one.”  Ali: Oh man. Who do I want to be better friends with?Goodrich: They’re both your friends.Ali (as Yashee): Eenie meenie miney mo. [Guys laugh]Ali: Who’s on the left? I don’t know.Kyle: Uh, Point.Ali: Alright, here we go.Kyle: Alright. So your initial damage-Ali (as Yashee): Sorry, buddy.[Dice roll]Kyle: Is going to Point.Ali: Okay. And that is thirteen.Kyle: Thirteen damage? Okay. Roll the bardic inspiration dice for the added attack, and that’ll be-Ali (as Yashee): Oh, it’s a one this time. Kyle: It’s a one? Okay.Ali: Oh, I just did that as Yashee.[Players laugh]Kyle: [in a different voice] I can see what you’re rolling up there, Ali.Ali: It’s a one, it’s a one. Here I am.Kyle: Okay. So you deal a whopping blow to Point, and there’s just like a “poom poom”, and you hear a cronch.Goodrich: Ohh.Kyle: And Point is just like:Kyle (as Point): [winded] Oh, dear God! Oh. Kyle: And it transfers – you transfer past Point on to Counter, and just, you know, you lightly graze Counter, and Counter’s just like-Kyle (as Counter): Oh, thank God. Don’t know if I could take another one like that, but – [winces] – you’re doing a great job, Yashee. [Goodrich chuckles] We couldn’t be prouder.Kyle: And Point chimes in:Kyle (as Point): [coughs] Yes, yes. [Ali laughs] Yes, you’re doing very well. You’re excelling faster than our other students. But we have one last flourish that we need to teach you, and that’s the mobile flourish. Uh, take heed behind you.Ali: I start looking.Ali (as Yashee): What, what?Kyle: Yeah. You look behind you, and you notice you’re fairly close to the edge of a cliff.Goodrich: That was our plan all along.Kyle: And Counter actually chimes in on this last one, says:Kyle (as Counter): Okay. So this flourish is gonna allow you to utilize hazards that are nearby when you’re in combat, like that ledge. Say you wanna kick someone towards that ledge, you can do so using this flourish. Let me at least show you real quick what I’m [straining] talking about. Kyle: And Counter steps out and attacks at you, and again, barely grazes you – but it’s so fast, you don’t really have time to react – and after the attack, just hikes up a leg and gives you a 300 kick in the chest – [Players laugh] – and slides you right back to the edge of that ledge. You don’t need to make a balance check or anything-Ali: Okay.Kyle: -you’re just standing right there. And Counter steps up into your space and says:Kyle (as Counter): Okay. Now save yourself. Hit me. Come on, hit me!Ali (as Yashee): Okay. Well, guess if I don’t, I’m kinda dead, so-Goodrich: We never saw Yashee again.Ali: Yep. [Rolls dice]Kyle: You hit. Alright.Ali: It’s a nineteen and an eighteen. So, yeah.Kyle: Yes, you hit. Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: Alright. [Rolls dice] Okay. Ooh, a one and a one, so that’s like eight total.Kyle: Okay. And add your – [dice roll] – damage.Ali: Okay, that’s a six.Goodrich: Wow.Kyle: So a fourteen.Ali: Is there a ledge behind him or are we good?[Goodrich laughs]Kyle: No. But you do-Ali: ‘Cause it’s the inspiration number plus five feet. So-Kyle: Okay. Yeah, yeah. So you push them back-Ali: So far.Kyle: -eleven feet, and winds up sliding up. And another feature of that is that you can actually take a step forward – uh, I can’t remember how far it is. What does it say in the book?Ali: Uh, within five feet, I can move to an unoccupied space.Kyle: Okay. So you can move five feet forward, getting out of danger being near that ledge. So-Ali: So I slip to the side.Kyle: Yeah, slip to the side.Ali: Whew.Goodrich: You clap [claps], shimmy.[Players laugh]Kyle: Okay. So they kicked to knock you back; how would you knock them back. What would you do in this situation?Ali: Hmm. Um, I’ll like swing, like wind up my mallets and chunk them at the same time, like right at their chest or something.  Kyle: Okay.Ali: Aww.Kyle: So yeah, the mallets go flying towards Counter’s chest, and just [crashing sound] hit them and knock them back the eleven feet that you knock them back. Ali: Cool.Goodrich: Do their ears drop like Wile E. Coyote? They’re holding a sign, “help! Help!” Kyle: No, they’re just beaming. They are smiling, despite looking a little beat up, each of them. They say:Kyle (as Counter and Point): You are going to do very well in the College of Swords, Yashe’rak. In fact, you might even do well enough to, uh, be an entertainer in our court [Goodrich snickers] if you ever found yourself on our side more often.   Ali (as Yashee): What do you mean “your side”?Kyle (as Counter and Point): You know, on our plane.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, okay.Kyle (as Counter and Point): You have your plane.Ali (as Yashee): What plane are you talking about?Kyle (as Counter and Point): Oh.Ali (as Yashee): Where are we right now?Kyle (as Counter and Point): We are on the Fourth Plane of the Tritonusraum [Goodrich giggles], in the land of King Frith the Crimson. We call this place Trockenplatz.Goodrich: No wonder your skills are so augmented here. [Players chuckle] Jeez. Kyle (as Counter and Point): Perhaps you could join us in our king’s court and, uh, you yourself could act like a Blade like we do, where, if there are hosting foreign dignitaries, we don’t have to act like there’s guards around. We’re just the entertainment, quote/unquote.Ali (as Yashee): That could be fun, maybe come have dinner or something.[Goodrich giggles]Kyle (as Counter and Point): Yeah, we have grand feasts, despite it not looking like we would.Ali (as Yashee): Great. Man, I have been visiting some really weird places lately. This just tops it. I mean, wow. A whole kingdom. Kyle (as Counter and Point): Where have you been?Ali (as Yashee): I don’t even – what? Yeah, just like here and there. [Goodrich laughs] I went, like, to outer space recently. That was weird.Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah.Kyle (as Counter and Point): Hmm, outer … space.Ali (as Yashee): Yeah. Like out – like out there.Kyle (as Counter and Point): We don’t know what you’re talking about.Ali (as Yashee): Maybe it’s like the fifth realm, I don’t know.Kyle (as Counter and Point): No, that is Zauberwald. Um-Ali (as Yashee): I don’t really understand realms.Kyle (as Counter and Point): That’s okay.Goodrich: I just go where they tell me. Going through the door; Yashee, you’ll be fine.Kyle (as Counter and Point): We do know that you’re from the Second Plane, which is Göttinträne. That was created by Altonia after the murder of her son Renaut. You know Altonia, Goddess Creator, right?Ali (as Yashee): I’ve heard of that one.Kyle (as Counter/Point): Okay. Well, regardless, we all inhabit our own plane of what is called Tritonusraum, and, you know, it’s the realms created by Altonia. We call this one Trockenplatz; as you can see, it’s pretty dry, but we thrive here and it works well for us. So how are things on your plane? Ali (as Yashee): I’ve been having a great time. I’ve made new friends this year, and got a sandatee.Kyle (as Counter/Point): We do not know what these things are.Ali (as Yashee): Oh, well.Ali: I pull out my pictures from my wallet. Ali (as Yashee): Look at this one. Ali: Flip ‘em open.Ali (as Yashee): There’s Sandy. She’s just so cute, and she’s sleeping right there. And here’s another one of her when we were riding together.Kyle (as Counter/Point): Well, that sounds sick. So you ride sandatees like we ride unicycles. Cool!Kyle: And at this point, you hear a large bellowing [deep horn sound in background] come over the land; it’s almost unintelligible. And you see both of them kind of, like, shudder a little bit, like “uh.” And then they say:Kyle (as Counter and Point): Well, that sounds like our time. We are being summoned back to our court. Yashe’rak Bordun, it was a pleasure to get to meet you and teach you, and we look forward to your next lesson.Kyle: And there’s another quick attack and a kick, and you get kicked right off that ledge.[Players laugh]Ali: I go off the ledge?Kyle: Yeah.Ali: I’m hanging off. I’m like:Ali (as Yashee): Thaaanks!Kyle: No. You get kicked off backwards, and you’re just falling-Ali: Alright. Oh, I see.  Kyle: And we are gonna end with you.Ali: Then I’ll go:Ali (as Yashee): Thanks, guys! This was fun!Ali: I try to play Featherfall, it just doesn’t work at all. My hammers are like flying on the leather straps.Ali (as Yashee): No, dang! I wanted to- no!Goodrich (in a Yashee voice): I need them for Featherfall!Kyle: They look over the edge, and they both wave.Goodrich: Aww.[Ali laughs]Kyle: And we’ll stop there with Yashee. Let’s go on to Randy.Spurrier: Oh boy.Kyle: So out from the blackness, this shadowed figure takes form and actually walks up to you, and you see a large smile on its face, a wide, toothy grin. It gets closer to you, and once you are, you know, a little bit closer, you notice that there’s actually a grayish, fuzzed outline to this figure. And you can gather from that, you can tell, that this being, whatever it may be, is at least humanoid in shape. It’s bald, no clothing that you can gather. But you can see them wave their hands to clear the shadow of the room that you’re standing in, and the shadow kind of disperses, revealing a darkened landscape that is barely lit by an eclipsed sun. You notice the ground seems to be shifting and flowing, but you can’t really pin down what’s going on. It stands there in front of you and says:Kyle (as Pianissimo): Okay, Randy. So, we have a lot to learn today, and you’re going to learn it. Are you ready?Spurrier (as Randy): Pp, I think I am.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yes, I like this name, Pp.   Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, phew. I was worried.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Where does this name come from?Spurrier (as Randy): [hesitantly] Well, it’s an abbreviation of your name.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Oh, I like abbrev – that’s great.Spurrier (as Randy): It makes things faster.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yeah, absolutely. Well, then PP it is.Spurrier (as Randy): Ah, good.Kyle (as Pianissimo): But Randy, tell me, have you ever used your words to damage someone’s psyche, either through song or spoken? You know, just really beaten someone down mentally?Spurrier (as Randy): It sounds wonderful, but I don’t think I have.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Hmm, okay. That’s fine. We are going to figure out how to do that for you. We want to impart these techniques so that when you attack with your daggers – which, please, bring your daggers out-Spurrier: [softly] Schwing.[Players laugh] Kyle (as Pianissimo): When you attack, you will want to be thinking of an insult, and you will channel them through your daggers. Think it in your mind, let it flow from there. Say it out loud if you would like, however you want to go about it, but make sure that you feel that flowing from your inner self, through your instruments, into the person when you hit them. Now, let me – let me show you here, real quick.Kyle: PP turns and faces Randy, and you see them clap and rub their hands together, and there’s a small flash of light. And you see them spread their hands apart, and their hands have been transformed into dagger-sized blades.Spurrier: Hmm.Kyle: They say:Kyle (as Pianissimo): Okay, Randy. Come and hit me, once, if you can.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Kyle: And you’re starting to attack, and you hear a voice in the back of your head say:Kyle (as Eddie): Oooh, let’s give it to this sucker! C’mon, Randy! Snuff the dagger stuff, let’s hit ‘em with something big! I know exactly what’ll chafe that hide.Goodrich: Ugh.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, okay.Kyle (as Eddie): C’mon, I got – I got something for ya. I got a new one for ya.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, well-Kyle (as Eddie): You wanna learn a new one? I can be a teacher too. C’mon, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, you made me a Zil, so-Kyle (as Eddie): Mmhmm.Spurrier (as Randy): -I’m not opposed.Kyle (as Eddie): How’s that undead servant treating you?Spurrier (as Randy): He’s fine. He’s living in a barn with a sandatee and just keeping to himself.Kyle (as Eddie): Oh, good. Good, that’s all they need. They don’t need anything. That’s why – it’s the beauty of the undead, Randy. Spurrier (as Randy): He seems content, yes.Kyle (as Eddie): Good, good. So stop that dagger stuff. C’mon.Kyle: Go ahead and give me a wisdom saving throw.Spurrier: Oh boy.Goodrich: Oh boy. Your favorite![Dice roll]Spurrier: That is a seven plus one.Kyle: No dice!Spurrier: Isn’t that always the case with good ol’ Eddie?[Kyle and Goodrich snicker]Kyle: So, uh, we have a spell lined up for you, and I’m gonna go ahead and use it. I know we’ve talked about spells coming up, since we’re doing a level-up bit.Spurrier: Uh-huh.Kyle: And this is gonna be you learning Vampiric Touch.Spurrier: Oh, okay.Kyle: So go ahead and give me the casting for Vampiric Touch.[Dice roll]Spurrier: That is a fourteen plus three. Kyle: Okay. That is going to hit, as PP is kinda just standing there, waiting for your attack.Goodrich: Jeez.Spurrier: Oh, good.Kyle: So you hit. So go ahead and roll the damage for your Vampiric Touch. Spurrier: So that is a 3D6, so if people wanna join in with me on that.Ali: Sure.[Kyle giggles; multiple dice rolls]Spurrier: I got a two.Goodrich: I got a two.Ali: I got a two.[Players make sounds of amazement]Goodrich: Randy’s gonna get in trouble!Kyle: So yeah, you do a Vampiric Touch, and you summon Eddie out of your belly to give that little bit of essence to it.Spurrier: Mhm.Kyle: And I’m – [players snicker] – how do you imagine this spell actually going down? Do you touch – do you touch PP or does – [players laugh] – or does-Goodrich: Which of you touch Pp?Spurrier: I’d like Eddie to, and I want him, whenever he casts this, to have some sweet fangs grow out. So we’ll really just have his fangs come in contact with Pp. Kyle: Okay, so that’s the touch. So fangs on the Pp.Spurrier: Fangs on the Pp.Kyle: And you hear PP go – just looks down and kind of swats the Eddie essence away, and it disperses and travels back into you. And PP goes:Kyle (as Pianissimo): This is not what I had you do. This is not anything I was going to have you do.Spurrier (as Randy): Can I try again? That was an accident.[Goodrich laughs]Kyle (as Pianissimo): I would prefer you do it.Goodrich: [laughing] A PP accident.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay.Kyle (as Pianissimo): There is no – there is no room for failure here, Randy. And I don’t know if you realize this, but you will do this or you will stay here until you can.Goodrich: Oh jeez.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh. So as long as I can try again-Kyle (as Pianissimo): Do you understand?Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah. If I can try again, that’d be totally great.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yes. What is – what-Spurrier (as Randy): Have you ever had a student who has a wizard living in their belly come through your realm?Kyle (as Pianissimo): [slowly] No.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, that would kind of explain it. Let’s just try again, if that’s cool.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright. This time, for real.[Dice roll]Spurrier: That is a four plus six.[Goodrich laughs]Kyle: Four plus six? That hits.Spurrier: Oh, phew. Goodrich: Wow.Kyle: Okay. So what are the words that you’re going to infuse? What’s the inner insulting mantra that you’re conveying with this psychic attack? Spurrier: To insult Pp?Kyle: Yeah. 'Cause your attack, what it does is, you do normal dagger damage, and then you’ll also add a psychic attack on top of it.Spurrier: Right. Okay.Goodrich: Uhh.Spurrier: So am I thinking this thing, since it’s psychic? I’ll think it and-Kyle: Yeah, you can think it. And, again, you know, remember PP was saying “let it flow through your daggers into”-Spurrier: Okay, cool. So I’m just gonna think, uh-Spurrier (as Randy): Pp, you know what that means, right? You’re just a big pile of piss![Ali laughs]Spurrier: And I send it out at him.Kyle: And, uh, yeah. So go ahead and roll your damage for the attacks there.Spurrier: Okay. So, uh, if someone wants to give me an additional D6, please?Goodrich: I got it.Spurrier: Thank you.[Dice roll]Goodrich: Six!Spurrier: Nice. [Dice roll] Plus four plus one plus three. So that’s fourteen.Kyle: Okay. Your daggers make contact and you’re imagining this mantra, and you can feel kinda – it’s almost like a weird negative energy that travels through your arms into your daggers. And you see them just kind of, like, pulse a little bit as they enter the essence of Pp. And – I’m sorry, I’m just gonna call him PP the entire time now.Goodrich: Yeah.Spurrier: I think that’s fine. Yeah.  Goodrich: But we all know it means Pianissimo. It’s fine. Kyle: Yeah, exactly.Goodrich: Regardless of what Randy thinks. Jeez!Kyle: So – and-Spurrier: Randy doesn’t even know what a P is.[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Yeah. As far as, like, musical notation and stuff in Beetzart, like, is that all the same? Like, you know, with dynamic markings like pianissimo and stuff?Kyle: Yeah. Yeah, I’m not – [laughs] – I’m not gonna go through, oh, it took like six hundred years to develop a musical notation system. No, I’m not doing that. Goodrich: So if we see a crescendo, it means crescendo, not, I don’t know.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: Not greater than or less than.Goodrich: Right. Well-Ali: If math is the same.[Overlapping conversation]Kyle: I’m not gonna get into that.Spurrier: It’s getting’ deep.Goodrich: It’s just like Randy’s daggers. Back to the story.Ali: Ohh!Kyle: At this point, you stab in, and PP goes: Kyle (as Pianissimo): Good, good. You could even infuse it a little bit further or better like this.Kyle: -and attacks back at you. Spurrier: Oh no.Kyle: But there’s this thing that’s happened in the past where, when you’ve received psychic damage, something lights up about you.Spurrier: Oh, yeah.Kyle: And while you do get attacked normally, you feel that same pulse. And it’s – it’s a little different than what you felt with Squid, but still it – so it doesn’t feel quite the same. It does hurt a little bit. And, uh, at this point, PP kinda recoils and is like:Kyle (as Pianissimo): What is this resistance you have?Spurrier (as Randy): Again, don’t fully – I’m gonna either blame it on my sweet ink on my back or the wizard in my tummy or the crack in my back, maybe a combination of all three. Do you want to touch the crack in my back?Kyle (as Pianissimo): No.Spurrier (as Randy): I don’t know if that’s your thing. Okay.Kyle (as Pianissimo): No.Spurrier (as Randy): I’m gonna say it’s one of those three things, is why this is happening. Kyle (as Pianissimo): Okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Hopefully that’s okay. That’s not a failure point, is it? Kyle (as Pianissimo): No.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay, phew.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Um, your attack, I felt the insult. What is piss?Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, yeah. Do you guys have that in this realm? Kyle (as Pianissimo): [slowly] No.Goodrich: Doesn’t know what it is.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, well, I mean – okay. You guys don’t have to – do you guys eat here? Or drink?Kyle (as Pianissimo): No.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. Then we’ll just leave it at that. It would be so insulting back home, you don’t even know.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Alright.Spurrier (as Randy): Yeah, take my word for it. I haven’t done insults in different realms. I hope that’s alright. Kyle (as Pianissimo): That’s okay.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. Phew.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Pianissimo): Uh, that was successful.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh good.Kyle (as Pianissimo): As expected.Spurrier (as Randy): And Pp, one question: does it have to be my daggers? I have other weapons; is this applicable to those, too? Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh.Kyle (as Pianissimo): This is an ability you can carry over from weapon to weapon.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, great!Kyle (as Pianissimo): Um, let’s move on to lesson number two.Kyle: And PP grabs out into the air, and you see everything start to fold at where they’re grabbing. And PP spreads their hands like they’re opening a curtain, and a curtain actually opens in a sense. And through the curtain you can see a fairly nice hallway, and in this hallway there is a door, a couple of plants, a bench, and by this door, there’s a guard standing there. PP slips through the curtain and melds into a nearby shadow, and Randy, you see PP emerge from the shadow as a small child. The child approaches the guard and begins to talk to them. You can hear PP clearly speaking, fairly innocuously, and as time goes on, you notice that there is an underlying tone that makes you a little uneasy.Spurrier: Mhm.Kyle: Kind of is like “ugh, that doesn’t seem good, but it doesn’t sound bad.” And after a little bit of time, you see this faint essence of shadow coming from Pp’s mouth, and this drifts into the guard’s – [Goodrich snickers] – I know. It’s gonna be great, every time.Goodrich: Oh my gosh![Players laugh]Kyle: I was writing this recently, I was just like “ah, there’s so much.”Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: But you see this essence drift from their mouth into the guard’s ear, and at this moment, the guard begins to look frightened. And they look left, they look right, as if to try to find someone, but then they begin to hastily shuffle away from their post in fear. PP shifts out of their disguise and steps back through the curtain and closes it, and then takes a bow.Kyle (as Pianissimo): See, the lesson with these words that you speak to them is not that – it’s not what you say, but how you say it.Spurrier (as Randy): Hmmm.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Do you understand? Spurrier (as Randy): I think so.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Okay. You can make people fear you, or you can make people fear someone else, whichever you prefer. Now it’ll be your turn to attempt this on someone. So, let’s see here.Kyle: And you see them hold – like, it looks like they’re holding a book, and they’re flipping through these dark pages, and say-Kyle (as Pianissimo): Ah, yes. Okay.Kyle: They close the book, and they grab the folds of reality again like a curtain, and they open it up. And you see a really nice washroom. It’s like fairly well-decorated: white floors, mirrors, nice countertops. And there’s a person that is working in there, and they’re – you know, people have come in and come out, and they have, you know, offered them soaps, offer to dry their hands and everything. Very upscale kind of washroom.Spurrier (as Randy): Mhm.Kyle: And PP says:Kyle (as Pianissimo): Go scare this attendant from their place and make them leave their job for a minute. It’s good, troublesome fun for them. Nothing harmful overall. Should be fine.Spurrier (as Randy): So it doesn’t matter what I say, like you said, just how I say it?Kyle (as Pianissimo): It’s how you say it, yes.Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. So I’m supposed to sound scary?Kyle (as Pianissimo): Uh, - [Goodrich chuckles] – Yeah. I mean, you know, you could say something along the lines of “oh, I’ve heard you have a very nice family. It’s been – it would be terrible if something were to happen, like their house collapsing while they were at home and you were at work.” Those kind of things are-Spurrier (as Randy): So what I say can also be of assistance?Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yes.Spurrier: Okay, good.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yeah, you can make it work towards your benefit. Of course, it doesn’t come off as hostile.Spurrier (as Randy): Right. Okay, okay.Kyle (as Pianissimo): But it, you know, stirs them up.Spurrier (as Randy): Alright. Spurrier: Well, I pass on through the planes of reality, through these sweet curtains.Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: And I walk up to this person, say:Spurrier (as Randy): Uh, morning.Kyle (as attendant): Oh, hello, sir. How can I help you today?Spurrier (as Randy): Do you ever just stop and think about it all?Goodrich: [Laughs] What’s it all about?Kyle (as attendant): Think about what?Spurrier (as Randy): Why you’re here, in this washroom, day in, day out – [Goodrich laughs] – handing soaps. Do you ever think it would amount to more? [Goodrich chuckles again] Do you ever think there was a deeper meaning? Do you ever think we were being controlled by robots, harvesting us for energy? Creating a simulation from which we’ll never escape.Kyle (as attendant): Oh God. What?Spurrier: And I go on in this fashion for a little while.Kyle: This person is kind of looking at you with terror in their eyes, just like-Kyle (as attendant): I don’t even know what a robot is. What’s – where – where do they come from? Wait, how do I avoid them?Spurrier (as Randy): Your first step will be leaving this post and-Kyle (as attendant): [frightened] Are they here?Spurrier (as Randy): They’re going to be, really soon.Kyle (as attendant): [gasps] Crap!Kyle: And they just drop the platter that they’re holding, they’re like:Kyle (as attendant): [flusters] I don’t care anymore! I’m out! No!Kyle: And they run out of the room, yelling about robots.Spurrier (as Randy): Don’t forget to question your existence.Goodrich: Byyye.[Ali giggles]Kyle (as attendant): It’s like nothing is real, everything’s a simulation.Spurrier (as Randy): Sounds about right. Goodbye.Kyle: And-Goodrich: Buy gold!Kyle (as attendant): Buy gold!Kyle: And the curtain is still standing open for you, but for some reason, this person did not seem to notice it at all. And you see through the curtain, you see PP just standing there, nodding, and a big, big toothy grin, just like-Kyle (as Pianissimo): Yes!Spurrier: So I pop back out and say:Spurrier (as Randy) Pp, this is – oh, it’s the best. Thank you.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Isn’t it great?Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, it’s so good.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Now, you must know, Randy, these secrets are not to be shared with those outside of your college.Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, that’s fine. Yeah.[Players chuckle]Kyle (as Pianissimo): Do not teach others our method.Spurrier (as Randy): No, no, no, no, no.Kyle (as Pianissimo): If you do, I will hear about it.   Spurrier (as Randy): Oh, I’m sure. The whispers and all that. So-Kyle (as Pianissimo): You’re smarter than you look, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): Thank you.Ali: [Laughing] Oh![Players laugh]Kyle (as Pianissimo): Well, to finally inoculate you into our college-Goodrich: Oh jeez.Kyle (as Pianissimo): -come here.Kyle: And you see them just conjure a bowl, an opaque bowl. And you see this material inside – and it’s black and shadowy, of course – but it’s shifting between being a liquid, a solid, and a gas. PP holds the bowl up to you and says:Kyle (as Pianissimo): Breathe deep of the gas, be inoculated, and welcome into our college.Spurrier: I stick my entire face in.[Ali chuckles]Kyle: You stick your face in, breathe deep, and you fall backwards, and your vision’s starting to go fuzzy. And you see PP standing over you and says:Kyle (as Pianissimo): It will be good to see you again, Randy.Spurrier (as Randy): [weakly] Bye.Kyle (as Pianissimo): Sweet dreams.Kyle: And your vision fades.Spurrier: Man, okay.Goodrich: Man, Randy attacking people with the existential terror of the void. Holy crap![Players laugh]Kyle: That was great.Spurrier: Oh, thank you. I can’t wait to talk to Garreth.  [Players laugh again]Kyle: Just one-on-one. Just one-on-one. Give me that time. Okay! So, Raz’ul.Goodrich: [with a deep voice] Yes?[Ali snickers]Kyle: Okay. You are standing in a wooded glen that is decorated with magic blips of light that come in and out of existence. The smell is the freshest forest you’ve probably ever smelled, being a druid. [Goodrich takes a long sniff and sighs with pleasure] And there’s a hint of sweetness that lines the air.Goodrich: That’s Splash.Kyle: Yeah. [Players laugh] That scent, right? You almost didn’t notice it, but you hear a subtle chime that permeates the background; it rings with a clarity unlike anything you’ve heard before.Goodrich: Hmm.Kyle: So as you’re taking all this in, Phil begins to walk around you, eying you up and down.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, hey.Kyle: He turns to Symbol after a couple of passes and says:Kyle (as Phil Harmonic): Yeah, I can see what you were saying, and why you would think he’d be a good fit. Not much on the surface, but ah, there’s something in those bones that is aching to come out, and that makes none of that matter. I can feel it. Alright, kid. Follow me over here.Goodrich: Cool. And first I, like, go over to Splash and I’m like,  Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Dude, how did you get in here? How did you know I was gonna be in Glamour? Does Alola know you’re here? Like, how old are you? How old is Phil? Also, I don’t think Randy knows how to read, but-Kyle: Phil responds, says:Kyle (as Phil): Uh, I’m running about 291. I’m around 291, and I’ll tell ya, Symbol’s been around a lot longer than I have.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What the heck, dude! You have to tell me everything!Kyle: Symbol is just like:Kyle (as Symbol): Phil, no.Goodrich: Okay, I’m like processing all this. Just like:Goodrich (as Raz’ul): But how – what – how did he get here, Phil? I don’t-Kyle (as Symbol): I mean, I just – I had the doorman open the door to this realm.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): The concierge.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh.Kyle (as Symbol): I can come here. This is … this is like a second home to me.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa!Kyle (as Symbol): Considering…Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, where are we? What the heck? Kyle: Phil chimes in, says:Kyle (as Phil): We’re in the fifth realm of Tritonusraum. We’re in Zauberwald.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, that – whoa, I never heard of that.Kyle (as Phil): So anyway, yeah. Come on over here to this basin.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah!Goodrich: Sorry, I started talking like Phil. I’m already starting to imitate Phil. [With a raspier voice] Yeah, let’s do this!Kyle (as Phil?): It’s okay. It’s pretty good, huh?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Phil): You like this?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, that’s good. Uh, yep. So let’s go.Kyle (as Phil): Okay. So bards of Glamour, you become one with the Fae. We use that link to the Fae and bring awe to crowds and inspire those that you’re in combat with.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Phil): The lead onstage and support offstage sort of thing. You get me?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle (as Phil): Okay. Now, uh-Kyle: Phil whistles real loud, and out of the edge of the nearby woods emerge a group of faeries. And Goodrich, does Raz’ul speak Fae at all?Goodrich: No.Kyle: I didn’t think so. Just making sure. Uh, they come over to Phil and Symbol, and they all begin to speak in a language you haven’t heard before. It looks like an interaction between old friends, and there – it looks like there’s a quick catch-up. But then, Phil looks like he’s explaining something to them and gesturing to you. The faeries all turn toward you and then begin to fly overhead in a circle. Phil looks at you, says:Kyle (as Phil): Okay. They’re gonna give you good dousing of Fae dust. Stand still. You ready?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Uhhh…Kyle: Okay. You see the faeries begin to chant while they’re sprinkling and dancing in a circle. Vibrantly colored dust is being dropped from their hands as they’re pulling it out of a bag that’s on their side. The dust lands on you, and where it lands, you notice that it causes your skin and clothes to glow. The glow disappears shortly after contact, but you feel a warmth inside you, and the colors of the forest begin to intensify. And suddenly, you begin to understand what the faeries are chanting. And, uh-Goodrich: Can I speak Fae now?[Pause; Ali giggles]   Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Dooooooh. Nailed it! Writing that down. Okay.Kyle: So you begin to hear what they’re chanting. And Spurrier, will you give me that “oom-pah” thing that I showed you earlier?Spurrier: Oh, yeah.Kyle: Okay.Goodrich: Jeez.Spurrier:  Here we go.[Piano starts playing, Goodrich giggles]Kyle (as faeries): [singing] The Faewild song is in our heart, it’s knowledge and magic that it imparts, we grant you this to enrapture the masses, to inspire your friends, and save your [pause] butts.[Players laugh]Kyle: So that’s what you hear the faeries chanting as they’re dousing you with this magical dust.Goodrich: I’m like dancing a little bit. I’m just, like, move my shoulders, like “Okay, this is something. Alright.” Kyle: Alright. So the faeries fly off after dusting you-Goodrich (as Ra’zul): Bye. Kyle: –and you hear them, you know, laughing, and they wave bye.Goodrich: And I say “bye” in Fae, which is “bye.” Kyle: Yeah, they say “bye” in Fae back.Goodrich: Sweet.Kyle: And Symbol and Phil are kinda looking, and Phil’s like:Kyle (as Phil): Okay, good. So you can speak Fae, obviously. You’ve nailed that down.Goodrich: I say “yes” in Fae.Kyle (as Phil): Yes.Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle (as Phil): Yes. But what you need to – what you need to be able to do now is – you know what I was saying earlier: there’s something in those bones of yours. You need to get that out of your bones and up through your – outside.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Face hole?Kyle (as Phil): Yeah, get it – get the inside out.Goodrich: What gesture are you making? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [Laughs] Bleurgh. Alright, yeah, that’s good.Kyle (as Phil): Yeah, you just – you know. Okay, I guess it’s better to show it. Symbol.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes.Kyle (as Phil): Symbol, please, go ahead and display the Mantle of Inspiration that you have been bequeathed.Kyle: And Symbol goes:Kyle (as Symbol): Okay. Um-Goodrich: Oh my gosh, I’m so excited!Ali: I’m very excited too.Goodrich: Oh!Kyle: And you see Symbol just kind of like strikes a pose, and there’s-Goodrich: I’m blown backwards.  I just fall over. [Players laugh] My eyes are burning.Kyle: You strike a pose, there is a gust of wind. Dust comes up from around his feet, and he looks down at the ground, then looks up at you with a glance, and just has, like, a smirk on his face like nothing you’ve ever seen.Goodrich: I have a teacher crush on Symbol now, immediately. I’m just like [wistful sigh].Kyle: And you notice locks of Symbol’s hair have, like, turned almost rainbowy-glittery in a way. He kind of twirls his finger around one of them and says:Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, my friend. You are going to be needing this extra health. Please take it, and take my courage with you.Kyle: And he gives you a wink.Goodrich: I’m blown back even further.[Players laugh]Kyle: And-Goodrich: I’m laying backwards. Oh jeez!Kyle: For right now, you have fifteen temporary hit points.Goodrich: Daaaang!Kyle: -that you can add to your box, so go ahead and mark those down. They will last – oh man. They last until they’re gone.Goodrich: Really?Kyle: Yeah.Ali: Nice.Goodrich: That’s aw – and I can start doing that now. Oh yeah!Kyle: Yeah, you – that’s a – you know. And Symbol says:Kyle: Yes, you feel that extra health. You feel that extra health? You can give that to Randy and Yashee. You can provide them a little bit of extra buffer if you get into a more dire situation.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa.Kyle (as Symbol): This is why I was glad to feel that you were gonna choose Glamour. I just – again, I – I sensed something. Phil got me on that, backed me up, that there was something there, and I had a feeling we’d be seeing each other here. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whoa, that’s crazy. How – so, is there some sort of, like, crazy door? Because you were, like, in that room, and then you’re here. How, and what? I’m still – this is all happening so fast.Kyle (as Symbol): It’s okay.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What the heck?Kyle (as Symbol): It’s the magic of Strumlotts. It’s – you know, that door is a portal of sorts that is changed and used as they and we see fit and need.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Symbol): Um-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Does Alola know you’re here?Kyle (as Symbol): Yes.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, phew. Oh jeez.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes, she knows I’m here. So, uh – but this is not why we’re here. We’re here so you can learn these things about the College of Glamour. So, Raz’ul, you need to find, deep down inside-Kyle: And Phil says:Kyle (as Phil): Eheheheh, Symbol.Goodrich: Right.Kyle (as Phil): Why don’t you take a back seat for a moment and, you know. I know you’re older than me, but you’re forgetting who’s supposed to be the teacher here right now.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle: And Symbol just says “ahh.”[Players laugh]Goodrich: He makes that face.Kyle (as Symbol): You’re right. You’re right, Phil. Goodrich: Ew.Kyle (as Symbol): Sorry.  Kyle: And Symbol goes, and you see the rainbow kind of fade from his hair and everything like that.Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: You still have your temporary hit points, if you’re wondering.Goodrich: Yup.Kyle: But he sits down and kind of reaches from behind the log that they’re sitting on and pulls up a little snack pack – [Goodrich laughs] – and busts it out and starts going to town on it.Goodrich: More pudding, right?Kyle: Yep. And Phil says:Kyle (as Phil): Okay. So, you know, symbol showed you what’s up. You feel it deep inside you. It’s gonna be in your core.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Phil): You gotta – you really gotta pull out the inner – insides of you. You know, not literally, but figuratively. Because if you pulled out the insides of you, you’d probably die.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Phil): I – I mean-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No. You know, you’re right.Kyle (as Phil): Depending on where you’re from.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. No, right. Yeah.Kyle (as Phil): So, uh, how about – take a moment. Think about it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Alright.Kyle (as Phil): And when you feel like you have a grip on your insides, a real nice hard grip, you just pull ‘em out of you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, alright.[Ali laughs]Kyle (as Phil): Pull ‘em on out.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright.Goodrich: And I’m getting all [groans with exertion] – [fart sound] – no. [Everyone laughs] No, no. I say:Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [groans with exertion]Goodrich: And then I do it just like Symbol did, like Bluesteel, like [relieved sigh].Kyle: Yeah. And a wave of energy comes back, and you see Phil’s beard and leg hairs just kinda rustle in the wind – [Goodrich laughs] – along with some of the overgrown foliage nearby.Goodrich: Yeah.Kyle: And any other difference to your look? How would you like to look when, you know, it’s-Goodrich: Yeah. When I was reading, I was kinda like, Man, I kinda wanna go like Ziggy Stardust-era Bowie.Spurrier: Mhm, yes.Goodrich: Like, just real, just like, boom! There it is.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: No questions. That’s just – that’s happening.Kyle: It’s like instant makeup and everything like that?Goodrich: Yes. Yeah. And I’m, like, totally just Spiders from Mars, like, let’s do this.Kyle: Yeah. Goodrich: Yeah. Just glam it out.Kyle: You totally have that appearance, and Phil is just looking like-Kyle (as Phil): Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that’s what I was smelling.Goodrich: And I say:Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [with Bowie accent] Yeah, it’s pretty freaky, man.[Players laugh]Kyle (as Phil): Yeah, it is. It’s a good feeling though, isn’t it?Goodrich (as Raz’ul)” Yeah.Kyle (as Phil): You feel like you have – the weight of your world is on your shoulders in a way, because you’re responsible for entertaining everyone.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. Yeah. Whoa.Kyle (as Phil): Yeah, no. But-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, yeah.Kyle (as Phil): It’ll be easier now.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hold on. [grunts] Yup.Kyle (as Phil): That Fae magic that you got, it’s inside you now. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Phil): It’s not going anywhere.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Phil): You’re not gonna run out of that. It’s not like we’re gonna have to come sprinkle you again.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. Phew, ‘cause I was-Kyle (as Phil): So you use that ability, you harness that. You, again, pull it out of you. Just pull it out of you as much as you can.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [grunts]Goodrich: He’s not pulling on me, is he?Kyle (as Phil): No.Goodrich: Oh, phew.Kyle: But he’s – he walks over and he – you know, he’s about – he’s a little bit shorter than you.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: -but not too much shorter. And he grabs you by your lapels and he says:Kyle (as Phil): Are you ready for the next one?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aaah!Kyle (as Phil): Are you ready, Raz’ul?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yes!Kyle (as Phil): Stand on that stump over there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Phil): Stand on that stump right there.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright.Goodrich: I go. I’m standing on the stump now.Kyle (as Phil): Good!Kyle: And he goes up and he, like, clumsily climbs up another stump that’s nearby. He says:Kyle (as Phil): Okay. This next one, we’re gonna bring out the-Kyle: And you hear him call out, and he says this – says this name.Kyle (as Phil): Tree-kins, come here. Get in here.Kyle: And it’s in Fae. You can tell he’s speaking in Fae.Goodrich: Alright, sweet.Kyle: And I’m not – I’m not gonna cover this. Basically, a bunch of pseudo-udo come out. Goodrich: Oh, awesome.Kyle: That’s more or less what they look like. Goodrich: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: I mean, you know, I’m not trying to cop that, but-Goodrich: Tiny little ents.Kyle: Yeah, they’re just tiny little, you know-Goodrich: Or tree-ents, I guess.Kyle: Tree – tree-kin. I think tree-kin are actually a thing in D&D, if I’m not mistaken. But regardless, they look like tiny stick people.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: So they all walk out-Goodrich: Not the tiny stick people that you would draw; tiny people made out of sticks.Kyle: Yes.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: Good defining point.[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Yeah, uh-huh.Kyle: So they all walk out and they’re all like-Kyle (as Tree-kin): What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what…Kyle: And-Goodrich: I don’t wanna leave here. I just wanna stay here.Kyle: And Phil’s just says:Kyle (as Phil): Shush, shush, shush. Not … not you, Raz’ul. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay.Kyle (as Phil): I know you’re just getting ready.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right.Kyle (as Phil): So, you’re gonna perform for a minute straight, and after you do so, you’re going to inspire at least one of these people – [Goodrich giggles] – to really be on your side.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): That’s the goal, right?Kyle (as Phil): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Every time we play, hope it’s – as long as one person takes something away, right?Kyle (as Phil): It’s an enthralling performance, and you could enthrall one person. You could enthrall maybe up to five people. I don’t know. It depends on – it depends on where you come around.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, right, right.Kyle (as Phil): So, you’ve got the Fae with you. Come on. Pull the performance out of ya, and show these tree-kin what the – what the dwarves from your world have to offer.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, okay.[Music fades out. Electric guitar chord.]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [singing] Do I attract you? Do I repulse you with my bardic style? Am I too dirty, am I too flirty to play what you like. I can be wholesome, I can be loathsome, I can be cordial or shy, why don’t you watch me, why don’t you watch me with that wandering eyes. I tried to be Phil Harmonic, but the looks were too drab, ah so I tried a little Symbol, hmmm, I’ve got the glamour and it’s rad! I could be brown, I could be blue, I’m just a bard in your eyes, I can be helpful, I can be purple, I can be playing all night, gotta be green, gotta be mean, gotta be playing some more, why don’t you watch me, why don’t you watch me walk out the door.Kyle: Dude, yeah. Oh yeah.Ali: Nice.Kyle: That’s awesome. Uh, yeah. So let me – I gotta make some spell saves for some people that are gonna be charmed by you. So equal to your charisma modifier, minimum of one; your charisma modifier is two. So [two dice rolls] no, I don’t think a five will do, and a one will not do either. So yeah. There are – there are two of these. I mean, every – all the little tree-kin are, you know, clapping. They’re like:Kyle (as Tree-kin): Yeah, great, sounds great!Goodrich (as Tree-kin):  Whoo-hoo.Kyle (as Tree-kin): It’s so good.Kyle: And – but there are two that, they’re like pushing their way through the crowd to get to the front, and they are clamoring at your feet on the stump. Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: Just like-Kyle (as Tree-kin): More! More! Goodrich: And I say:Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. Oh. [strums guitar, starts singing] Oh, oh, oh…Kyle: And Symbol is just sitting back there, he’s kind of – kind of laughing. You know, eating his pudding cup and everything. He’s just like-Goodrich: No spit take? He just-Kyle: No spit take. Just, you know, he’s like  Kyle (as Symbol): Man, that was really good. That was really good, Raz’ul.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, thanks, prof. I mean, I got nothing on what you’re dishing out over there, but you know, I’m learning.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah, you know, you’ll get it all someday.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): And that’s what we’re here for, that’s what Phil’s here for.Kyle: And you still feel like the two little tree-kin people kind of, you know, pulling at your pant legs and everything.Goodrich: I just pat them. Uh, okay.Kyle: Yeah. So but essentially, these two are charmed by you, and while they are charmed, they’re going to idolize you. They speak glowingly of you to anyone they talk to about you.Goodrich: Right.Kyle: And this lasts for an hour, and regardless, it’s not like they really – it’s not like they know that they’re charmed.Goodrich: Right, yeah.Kyle: They’re just enthralled by that performance.Goodrich: Well, I think I read after it ends they still don’t know they were charmed.Kyle: Yep.Goodrich: Which is pretty awesome.Kyle: Yep.Ali: [quietly] Yes.Kyle: Absolutely. So – and, you know, of course you’ll be able to use this again. This was like learning.Goodrich: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: So I know it says, you know, long, short rest, whatever. You’ll be good to go. You’re not like – you’ll be able to use it later on.Goodrich: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: So – but Symbol and Phil, they kinda turn to you and they’re just like – Phil says:Kyle (as Phil): Alright, you tree-kin, get out of here. Get out of here. Especially you two. You’re being weird.[Goodrich giggles]Kyle: And they kinda look sad at Phil and they’re just holding onto your pant leg.Goodrich: And I say:Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, it’s okay. It’s okay. You gotta go. And you live here and I live – well, I’m not quite sure how to put this, but not where you live. So take my performance with you, and in an hour or so, you’ll be fine.Kyle (as Tree-kin): You’ll come back?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh, sure, maybe. Symbol came back.Kyle (as Tree-kin): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You know. You like Symbol? [excited whisper] He’s going by Splash now.Goodrich: I whisper into their ears or their-Kyle (as Tree-kin): Ooooh!Goodrich: -knotholes. [flustered] What do tree-kin have in terms of listening devices?     Kyle: You just whisper to them. You can’t tell.Goodrich: Okay.Kyle: You’re not up on the anatomy of tree-kin.Goodrich: Yeah, okay. Well, I do that.Kyle: And he’s like:Kyle (as Tree-kin): Oooh, Splash! Splash! Splash! Splash!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, tell everyone.Kyle: And you hear Symbol grimace. Just, like, normally that’s a facial thing, but you hear a “mm.”Goodrich: Right.Kyle: And Phil goes:Kyle (as Phil): What? What are they saying?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): No, it’s this thing. Kyle (as Tree-kin): Splash! Splash!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I figured that would be easier for them to say. Symbol, two syllables, they seem like, you know, a one-syllable name would be easier for them, so-Kyle (as Symbol): He’s lying to you again, Phil. My students call me Splash because they think it’s funny because it’s Symbol.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Because you spell your name super weird. We’re musicians and you spell your name S-Y-M-B-O-L? What is wrong with you?Kyle (as Symbol): I spell my name how I spell it. I don’t comment about how you spell your name but-Goodrich: Sorry. I’m just digging on you, Kyle.Kyle: And Phil – [players laugh] – I know. And Phil is like:Kyle (as Phil): Hahahaha, that’s actually pretty good. So Splash, are you changing your name again now? You going to change your name this time? What’s happening?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, was your name not Symbol before?Kyle (as Phil): Uh-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Phil, dish. Dish, Phil.Kyle (as Phil): Ah, that’s – that’s for him to tell and, you know. But I tell you this: your teacher, even in the time that I’ve known him, ha, different name, different face. I don’t know.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Whaaaat?!Kyle: And Symbol’s just like:Kyle (as Symbol): Phil!Goodrich: Bro![Players laugh]Kyle (as Symbol): You’re – he means different faces for different performances. You – you know, much like how your Mantle of Inspiration allows you to look a little bit different – as does mine – different face. Goodrich: Can I roll insight on Symbol?Kyle: Yeah, absolutely. Go right ahead.Goodrich: Awesome. This was a skill I was gonna make better later. [Rolls dice] Aw, man, yes! Eighteen plus five.Kyle: You can tell he’s not being truthful with you.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aww. Splash. Splash?Kyle (as Symbol): Yes?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Come on.Kyle (as Symbol): No.Goodrich: Can I roll persuasion?Kyle: Yeah, if you want to. [Dice roll] It’s gonna be very hard-pressed.Goodrich: Mmm.Kyle: Very difficult.Goodrich: How about a sixteen plus six?Kyle: Sixteen plus six. Symbol looks at you and he goes:Kyle (as Symbol): [inhales]Goodrich: I make a little sad face.[Ali laughs]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [in a wheedling tone] Splash, you can tell me. We’re in this whacky place. This is where you’re from? Question mark?Kyle (as Symbol): This is not where I’m from.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. But back to the other question-Kyle (as Symbol): I will tell you-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Other faces, other names? Come on. Come on.Kyle (as Symbol): Okay, okay. I tell you what.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle (as Symbol): I will tell you why I changed names.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh, instead of – I mean-Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay. That’s even better. You know what? I’ll take it.Kyle (as Symbol): Yeah. If you’re around too long, people suspect something weird about you. Artists come and go, and, uh, can’t be around for too long as one person.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Rrriiight. Yeah, it don’t make no sense, Splash. What was your other name? Just tell me.Kyle (as Symbol: Sorry.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): [groans] Alright. Can you give me the first letter of it?Kyle (as Symbol): No.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.[Ali giggles, Goodrich whimpers]Kyle: Phil’s just kind of over there chuckling like, “heheh.”Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can you tell me, Phil?Goodrich: Let me roll on Phil. Here we go. [players laugh] I’m just playing, I’m just playing. That was – I probably would have had to roll something insane to get him to tell me.Kyle: Yeah, yeah, considering how I see Symbol being preserved about himself.Goodrich: Preserved?Kyle: Yeah, he’s all in a jar and whatnot.[Players laugh]Spurrier: He’s so sweet and tasty! Kyle: Yeah, you know.Spurrier: All filled up with pudding.Goodrich: Right, yeah. Alright, sorry. Okay, okay, okay.Kyle: No. But, sorry, being reserved about himself.Goodrich: Yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: But he thought you were being very cute.Goodrich: Okay, good. Well-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, Splash. Well, you know, whenever you wanna let me know, I would love to know.Kyle: Let me find the name I wanna tell you.Goodrich: [snickers] Says Kyle, the DM, or Splash?Kyle: Yeah.Kyle (as Symbol): Well, any artist has their ups and downs. Um, let me find one of the good ones.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Jeez, how many names do you have, Splash?Kyle (as Phil): Again, he is a lot older than I am.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh my gosh!Kyle (as Phil): He’s been around for a while.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Wink?Kyle (as Phil): Yeah, wink.[Players giggle]Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Do you – do you – okay. Wow. Well, cool. Um, I’m starting to get a little freaked out by you, Splash. Uh, can you say-Kyle (as Symbol): That’s okay. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Can you do that Mantle of Inspiration thing again? That was great.Kyle (as Symbol): Yes.Kyle: Looks up at – he does the same pose, looks up-Goodrich: Daah!Kyle: And you get blown back, and you’re knocked unconscious as your head hits a rock.[Players laugh]Goodrich: Oh no!Kyle: And we are done with you.  Goodrich: [sighs] Oh jeez.Kyle: Yashee, you’re falling.Ali: Oh.Kyle: Randy, you passed out. Raz’ul, you passed out.Goodrich: What a party.Kyle: Yashee, you land. You land on a stone floor, and you see Randy and Raz’ul just asleep on the ground. You notice a large bronze statue, and you see it’s Strumlotts again. You’re back in the room where you – before you’d stepped through to your teachers’ room. And Strumlott stands there, goes:Kyle (as Barenthall): Well!Goodrich: [Laughs] Yeah.Kyle (as Barenthall): Wasn’t that – wake up! Wasn’t that fantastic?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Aaah.Kyle: You two are woken up by the sound of Strumlott’s booming voice.Ali (as Yashee): Hey guys.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Splash has other names! He has so many other names! He’s so old, you guys. Oh, Splash was there in my room. It was nuts.Spurrier (as Randy): Aww, lucky. And…what?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Uh – [Ali giggles]. Well, sorry. Uh-Kyle (as Barenthall): Oh, I will just wait here, like I always do. [Players laugh] It’s fine.Goodrich: I tell them pretty much everything that happened in my room, or in my plane. All-Ali: Just exploding with-Goodrich: Bam!Kyle (as Barenthall): That Splash guy sounds like one cool cat.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): He i- – hey, you know what? Ali (as Yashee): Wow.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. He, uh – well [stammers] man, I just – I need to lie back down. [Players laugh] Just need to process all this.Kyle (as Barenthall): Well, you all seem to have come out on the other side – being this side, so back on the same side – but you are together and you are in one piece. Hopefully your teachers imparted the knowledge that you need, and you are not being kicked out of the school. So-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We actually didn’t cover that in my room.Kyle (as Barenthall): Oh well.[Goodrich laughs]Ali (as Yashee): I mean, I definitely got kicked, but probably not out of the school.Kyle (as Barenthall): Ha! [Players laugh] Now, for the final test-[Goodrich groans]Kyle: -and you see the statue take its lute and pound it into its hand, like it’s holding like a club, and it looks at you menacingly. It goes:Kyle (as Barenthall): Ha ha! Just kidding!Goodrich: Oh my gosh!Kyle (as Barenthall): Now go ahead and sing yourself out the door. Goodrich: Not – [sighs] – oh jeez.Kyle: And, uh, let’s go ahead and roll some chord dice as you sing as you’re leaving this place.[Music transitions]Goodrich: So we’re basically just, like, playing ourselves out.Kyle: Yup, play yourselves out. Goodrich: Okay. That – okay. This is a nice song we’re writing for Barenthall.Kyle (as Barenthall): Get out! [Players laugh] Play yourselves out the door. Goodrich: Alright, fine.Kyle: But, you know, as far as the whole leveling-up thing, we’ve done everything for the bard, more or less, but we’re gonna actually do, like, the detailed level-up at the beginning of the next episode. So let’s just do this song.Goodrich: Yeah. Well, and there’s like other stuff, like we all learned bard – other bard spells and other things.Kyle: Yeah, it’s true Goodrich: So this was just the- Kyle: Just the colleges.Goodrich: -our bard colleges, yeah.Kyle: So we gotta cover all the extra details that we hadn’t covered or didn’t cover this episode.Goodrich: Yep.Ali: Cool, cool.Goodrich: Cool. Well, major or myinor?Ali: Uh, are we happy to be leaving or sad to be leaving?Goodrich: I’m kinda sad, I don’t know. Like, I was thinking the whole time-Ali: I had a good time.Goodrich: -you guys kinda had like masochistic teachers.Spurrier: Mine was awesome though.Goodrich: No, no. They’re like “stab me!”Ali: I liked mine too.Spurrier: Well, I mean, for like Randy, it was great.Goodrich: Right, so that’s fair.Ali: Mine complimented me a lot, and I like that.Kyle: Maybe ‘cause theirs are more combat-oriented.[Overlapping conversation]Spurrier: Sad song, [sings] “Bye-bye, Barenthall.”Ali: Yeah, A minor.Goodrich: Aww.[Piano chord]Goodrich: So minor?Spurrier: Minor, yeah, yeah, yeah.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: Sure. Let’s do it.[Multiple dice rolls]Goodrich: Ugh, two wilds.Kyle: We’re not on the road anymore.Goodrich: No, we’re not. [Two dice rolls] Okay. Two G’s, an E minor, and a B diminished.Kyle: Hey, that’s not bad.Spurrier: And/or E.Goodrich: And/or E. Oh, actually.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: Phew.Kyle: Not bad, not bad.Ali: And of course, the A minor. Goodrich: Right. And what time signature do we wanna do?Kyle: Uh-uh-uh.Goodrich: I kinda wanna do 3. Ali: Yeah, I think that’s fine.Goodrich: I’ve wanted to do 3 ever since we’ve been doing this.Ali: I think – especially for, like, a nice goodbye song Goodrich: Yeah.Ali: I think that would work well.Kyle: Alright.Goodrich: And are we saying, too, if we wanna do 3, can that also be 6/8? Or is-Kyle: Sure. It’s a triple.Goodrich: Okay. Cool.Kyle: Scott.Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah. Scott.Ali: Alright. So there’s ten different triple-meter patterns-Goodrich: Alright.Ali: -so I’m just gonna roll a D10. [Rolls dice] It’s a six, which is gonna be…a waltz.Goodrich: Aww.Kyle: Oh yeah.Goodrich: Waltzing with Barenthall.Kyle: Yeah.Goodrich: It’ll be great.Ali: And I guess I still roll the kit.Goodrich: Yeah, the sound. Let’s do another electronic waltz.[Dice roll]Kyle: Yeah.Ali: It’s gonna be twenty, so-Goodrich: Ooh.Ali: It’s gonna be Funk 02.Goodrich: Alright.Ali: A funk waltz.Goodrich: Funky waltz.Kyle: Funko, too.Goodrich: [chuckles] Yeah. Okay.Kyle: Right on. Alright. Well, get to writing, and listeners, talk to you in a second.[Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone. It’s your dungeon maestro Kyle here, just wanting to give you another thank you for listening, jumping in the pot with us, and stewing up a good mix for Chaos Sauce to spice up. So let me get through some special news real quick: Last Tuesday, Chaos Sauce Vol. 2 dropped for you. You can go to our Bandcamp, Bombarded.bandcamp.com, pick that up, pay what you want. Next week, next Tuesday, October 2, we are releasing the OST Vol. 2. Spurrier and Goodrich are doing their magic. They worked through some things and figured out what was gonna be the best stuff from those episodes, Episodes 11 through 20. So that’ll drop next Tuesday on our Bandcamp. Next next Tuesday, October 9, we’re not gonna be releasing a normal episode. What we do have in store for you is our trip to GEXCON. We actually – we decided to be actually traveling bards, made a trip up to Chantilly, Virginia, and along the way, we wrote songs for each state we went through. Now, of course, we couldn’t write the entire time, so, you know, we skipped state to state. But over it all, we wrote six songs, and a little shoutout for Georgia, my home state. It was a fun trip, we had a great time, met great people. We’re excited to share it with you, so hopefully you enjoy that. But yeah, we had a great time doing that. And so after that episode drops, on October 23, we’ll have the podcast resume, you know, properly.Alright. And as usual, don’t forget about our social media: you know, @BombardedCast; if you wanna talk about the podcast, #BardCast. Don’t forget to go to our website, which is BombardedCast.com. You’re gonna find our email, PO box, links to the Bandcamp – Bombarded.bandcamp.com if you wanna skip that step. It’s all there for you, including a link to the band behind everything, Lindby, LindbyMusic.com. Haven’t mentioned it in a while, felt I needed to now. Um, I’m your dungeon maestro Kyle, and I approve this message. And let’s get back to listening to our bards. Thank you, bubye.[Music transitions]Ali (as Yashee): Well, you know, I’m a little sadder about this than I thought I was gonna be.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah.Ali (as Yashee): Getting a little teary-eyed, so-Kyle (as Barenthall): Why?!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): You’re awesome, is why.Ali (as Yashee): You’re so sweet, you know? Here, we got a great song, just for you while we’re leaving. Here we go.Kyle (as Barenthall): Alright. Leave, and play the song. [Piano begins playing]Ali: [singing] Bye, bye, Barenthall, so long and farewell, you’ve been so kind and inviting, and we hate to leave your cell. La dee da, da dee da da da da da.Spurrier and Goodrich: [singing] Barenthall, so statuesque.Ali: [singing] La dee da, da dee da da da da da-Goodrich and Spurrier: [singing] Barenthall’s really the best.All: [singing] Bye, bye, Barenthall, so long and farewell, you’ve been so kind and inviting, and we hate to leave your cell. La dee da, da dee da da da daa da, Barenthall so statuesque. La dee da, da dee da da da daaa da, Barenthall’s really the best. So bye bye Barenthall, so long and farewell. You’ve been so kind and inviting and we hate to leave your cell. La dee da, da dee da da da daaa da, bronze never looked quite so good. La da da, da da da da da daaa da, we’d stay here all day if we could. Bye, bye, Barenthall, so long and farewell, you’ve been so kind and inviting, and we hate to leave your cell. La da da, da da da da da daaaa da, la da da, da da da da daaa. La da da, da da da da da daaa da, la da da, da da da da da daaa.Kyle: As you’re walking towards the door, playing, the door actually appears in place and begins to swing open. And you see that familiar nightclub that you’re used to, and on the other side is Alola Greenspire, waiting for you. And we’ll pick up with that next time.[The music from the bards’ song fades out as the episode ends]"
PROCESSED,https://bombardedcast.com/march-of-toys-mvt-i,"March of the Toys, Mvt. I","March of the Toys, Mvt. I[Theme music plays with added jingle bells]Kyle: Hey everyone, welcome to BomBARDed! Today we’re going to be doing a little bit of a special episode for you for the holidays.Goodrich: Holidays! Kyle: We hope you’re ready for a little bit of a side adventure. Goodrich: Hope your par-um-pum-pum-pumped! [All laughing]Ali: Oh my gosh.Kyle: Pretty good.Goodrich: It’s from a Best Buy commercial, so-Kyle: Oh. Okay, nice. Spurrier: They’re sponsoring us today. Goodrich: Our sponsor, brought to you by Best Buy!Kyle: If you didn’t get your present go get it right now. You know it’s there, probably. Goodrich: Or wait in line.Spurrier: Par-um-pum-pum-pumped.Kyle: Okay! So, we’re going to be doing a little bit of a side adventure today, just something for, ya know, a little bit of holiday festivities, for some fun. I have no other way to preface it than that, so let’s just get into it!Goodrich: Yeah, so weird! Real quick, so where does this all fall in kind of like the BomBARDed timeline? Kyle: Uh it’s… I’m gonna treat it like how animes treat movies of themselves.Goodrich: So, like just totally out of context. Kyle: Yeah, it doesn’t matter really. Goodrich: Okay, but as far as stuff we know, like we know seventh chords, right? Please? Kyle: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ali: We have what we’ve had and we know what we know? Kyle: Yeah, you have the items you have, you know what you know.Goodrich: And it’s Christmas!Spurrier: Hurray! Goodrich: Or whatever this holiday is. Ali: Something like that.Spurrier: Beetzart Christmas. Kyle: It’s a, well, we’ll get into what it is.  [Light jazzy holiday music begins to play]Kyle: So, our adventure begins in the small town of Beln, which is on the north-east side of Lake Ekal. We’re starting off, it’s that wintery time of year. It’s nice and cold out, a little brisk. You bards are playing in the middle of the town and you’re on this makeshift stage. Goodrich: We’re playing music, we’re not playing like ‘ah-ha-ha-ha snowball fight!!’Kyle: Yeah, no you’re not playing, you’re performing. Goodrich: We’re working then. Kyle: Yeah, you’re performing. So, basically what this is, is every year Beln has this event called The March of the Toys. The coordinator of the event reaches out to Strumlott’s to see if there’s any bards who are willing to do a community service. You guys were asked to do this event and you agreed. Ali: It’s because we’re the very best band in Beetzart, or ah, at Strumlott’s, everyone knows.Kyle: Yeah! You’re good people. Goodrich: They probably picked us because we had the most Christmas spirit. Kyle: Yeah, you really exhibited a want to do. So yeah, you’re performing in the middle of these festivities. There’s people cooking, kids running around screaming and playing, it’s lightly snowing and everything. It’s just a nice, beautiful winter day. Spurrier: Mmmm, love it. Kyle: So, the smells are mingling together and everything. It’s getting close to noon, the sun is getting to its apex, and the coordinator for this year’s festivities approaches you -they’ve been a little frantic this entire time- and they approach you with pieces of paper.Kyle (as Coordinator): Okay, here, here, here, here’s the sheet music! You’ve done great so far, really appreciate everything you’ve done, but we really need to nail this, for this next part to be a real success for the event. Now Wonderman, Mr. Wonderman, he’s gonna be here soon. He’s the toymaker, he’s the one that’s bringing in the toys. He will let you know when you need to play the march for the actual toys to march in. He should actually be here any moment now, if you don’t mind just getting ready to play this once he-Kyle: And, they kind of get distracted and they’re just like,Kyle (as Coordinator): Johnny Fincher you get off that right now! Kyle: And storms off. And you’re left for a few minutes before you notice the crowd starting to quiet and clear the street. You hear tapping coming from down the road and then over the crest of the hill comes a large red, white, and green colored cart, and there’s streamers and flags of similar colors waving in the wind. You notice the cart isn’t led by any kind of beast, it’s just up on little legs and it’s walking like-Goodrich: Oh nice!Kyle: Yeah, it just has little legs it’s walking on. Goodrich: It’s like the spider in Wild Wild West?[All laughing]Kyle: Yeah, it’s kind of like that! Goodrich: But sooo Christmas-y!Kyle: Yeah exactly! But you see a man behind the controls of it and he’s moving rather clumsily around it and it’s walking a little clumsy, but he get’s it up to about 20 feet from everyone and the cart turns sideways. He stands up and he’s wearing a large trench coat with many sewn on pockets, he has a pair of fingerless gloves, he has a really intricate pair of spectacles on that look like they can adjust different magnifications, and he has a large hat that’s decorated with squares and a circle inside the center of those squares. His cart comes to a stop and you hear the crowd starting to chant “Wonderman! Wonderman!” and everyone’s really excited and they’re cheering him on. He steps up on to the top of his carriage and he says: [Christmas music swells]Kyle (as Wonderman): Greetings to you townsfolk of Beln! My home! My people! It is once again that time of year to bring joy to every child’s heart through the merriment of a new friend. Oh! And this year is going to be extra special!Kyle: And he gives a really big nod and a wink. [Music suddenly stops]Goodrich: To us, to like start playing?Kyle: To everyone.[All - Ohhhh]Goodrich: We’re still going over our music like, ahh we gotta sight read this business? Everyone’s watching.[Players chuckle]Ali: Right? No pressure guys. Kyle: You’ll be fine. Goodrich: When all this is happening can I do prestidigitation to kind of make things a little more festive, a little more Christmas-y? Kyle: Yeah, zhuzh it up a little bit. Goodrich: Okay, and I guess since we’re on stage, do you guys want to play with me? Kyle: I think that’s a good call. Ali: Sure.Spurrier: Oh, yeah, that would make sense. Goodrich: So yeah, here we go! [All playing the tune of Holly Jolly Christmas]Goodrich (singing): Have some prestidigitation, it’s a festival begin, sparklers fly and fill the sky and make the children grin! Spurrier: Yay, beautiful.Goodrich: So, a bunch of stuff flies around all Christmas-y and everyone’s like wow, cool!Kyle: Yeah, a bunch of fireworks and streamers and banners pretty much come out of nowhere. Spurrier: Like a little Gandalf over here. Kyle: Yeah, and everybody’s digging in on it and you can see Wonderman is just kind of nodding in approval. He’s just like, big thumbs up. [All laughing]Kyle: So, Wonderman kicks his carriage and the side falls open. Inside the carriage are many lines of toys. There are elephants, small dinosaurs, bears, and large ornately painted bouncy balls. Behind all these toys stands a human sized… it looks like a teddy bear? Almost more like a bugbear teddy bear. Spurrier: Ohhhh, no.Kyle: I’m imagining like the teddy bomber from Cowboy Bebop.[All laughing]Kyle: But yes, he’s just standing there in the back and Wonderman begins to search through his many pockets. Like, he’s just really rifling through them, before excitedly producing a wand from an inner pocket, ya know, on the inside. And he’s just like ah, yes, finally, and he looks at it really intently before grabbing it in a certain way.Kyle (as Wonderman): Well, if our musicians are ready, we can begin the march! Kyle: And he begins to count off the march.Goodrich: We all run on stage and flick our cigarettes like “Oh! Jeez! Here’s our cue!” [All laughing]Goodrich: Just kidding! No, no, we flick our candy canes. Spurrier: There you go, we finish our nog. Ali: Take an extra crunch of the cane, yeah. [makes a crunching noise]Kyle: So, he cues you up to being the march and when the march starts he begins to wave the wand and you notice this magical aura begin to emanate from the carriage and, slowly but surely, the toys all slowly begin to start marching forward out of the box.Goodrich: I say “Kids run! Run!!”Ali: Do we know this is going to happen or is this kind of new to us. We know the game plan? Kyle: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. You know that he brings toys in and they march out and go hide and kids are meant to go find them. Goodrich: Ohhhh.Ali: Okay, cause otherwise I’d be pretty freaked out about that. So, cool. Goodrich: Yeah, I was about to say that’s why I yelled. Kyle: Yeah, you definitely know that that’s the case.Goodrich: [under his breath] Thank god.[Jaunty holiday music begins to play]Kyle: So, your music begins to fill the air and all the toys are beginning to march down the walkway. All except for the large teddy bear that’s in the back. Wonderman shouts “March!” in glee, and the toys begin making their way off into different paths in the town, and off into different streets. They start running into different little hiding spots and the children instantly start to scatter, start searching for different toys and there’s one ball that’s still trying to get a chance to hide before a kid runs over to it. At this point, it’s about the second time of the a-section, you’re playing the melody, give me a quick perception check. Ali: Oh, alright. Kyle: To see who notices this. Goodrich: Is this to see how well we’re sight reading all of this? Kyle: No, that would be an intelligence check. Or a performance actually would be a sight-reading thing.Spurrier: Fourteen plus three. Kyle: Cool, cool, cool.Ali: Six plus one. Kyle: Okay, not you. Ali: [laughing] Yashee is very mesmerized by the prestidigitation sparkles and just the overall feeling.  Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah! Wow! Ali: She’s got a little tear in her eye, just looking up like “this is beautiful.” Goodrich: I never had a good Christmas when I was a kid. Or, whatever this is called.Kyle: Alright, Raz’ul? Goodrich: I got a thirteen plus three, sixteen. Kyle: Okay, you notice when the a-section comes around after the b-section as this kid is approaching the ball you hear something stand out really odd to you. You hear the melody also being played in minor [minor holiday music begins to play] and you see Wonderman on a flute. You notice at this moment that the ball the kid is running up to, it bounces for a second and then when it bounces up the next time it spins violently and it causes it to shoot forward into the child’s face once it hits the ground. Goodrich: Ohhhhhh!Kyle: The kid is beamed by this ball in the face and it just knocks him off his feet straight on to the ground. He begins crying and after this you begin to see other children start running out of the alleyways as toys are chasing after them and trying to attack them with their teeth, claws, and tusks. Ali: Uh-oh. Goodrich: I turn to you guys and sayGoodrich (as Raz’ul): Well, this looks like a job for Chaos Sauce.[players chuckle]Kyle: To paint this a little bit further, you’re standing on a roadway that has a bunch of little maniacal toys and behind all of them you have the large teddy bugbear and then behind that you have Wonderman and his cart. Goodrich: So, I turn to you guys and say,Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Should we like, start playing in minor? Is this like a...? I’ve never been to this town before, is this supposed to happen?Spurrier (as Randy): Start helping out with it, really encouraging. Ali: So, I don’t even notice this happening? I’m stuck in wonderment of all the beautiful-Kyle: Yeah, you didn’t notice the tone, or the playing it in minor. You definitely notice all the commotion going on. Ali: Oh, great, okay. Kyle: So, you just don’t realize what caused… like, something linked to it. So yeah, you have a whole slew of about thirty of these toys. It’s about ten bears, ten elephants, ten dinosaurs -a mix of triceratops and stegosaurus-, and ten bouncy balls, and then there’s the teddy bear. The big, human sized teddy bear.Spurrier: Is Wonderman still playing his flute? Kyle: Nope, he put it away and packed up the cart and looks like he’s getting behind the controls to jet off. Spurrier: Ah.Goodrich: Well I definitely think the way to approach this is to go after each individual thing that is chasing… Nah, I’m just playing. [Players laughing]Ali: How far away is he from us?Kyle: He is about thirty-five feet. Ali: Can I try to just run over there to get him before he goes?Kyle: You can try, but you’re gonna pass through about fifteen attack of opportunity sections.Ali: Oh no.Spurrier: Is he… like could I hit him with a bow? Kyle: You could try. Spurrier: Okay. Goodrich: [sarcastically] You could try!Kyle: So, uh, I tell ya what, let’s go ahead and do some initiative. Goodrich: Oh boy. Spurrier: Oh man. Kyle: Just to see how this pans out. Christmas initiative!Spurrier: Freakin’ Wonderman and his-Goodrich: I got a fourteen!Kyle: Okay.Ali: I got a sixteen plus one, so seventeen. Kyle: Alrighty. Spurrier: I got that big ol’ twent! Kyle: Oh sweet![Angelic chorus plays]Goodrich (singing to the tune of Hallelujah Chorus): Natural twenty, natural twenty, natural twentyyyy!Kyle: Okay, so here’s how the round’s going to start, Wonderman’s at the top, furiously running through the contraption and what not. Pulling a bunch of different levers and pulling different chords and everything. Goodrich: Starting up his gas motor! Like, why won’t it start!?Kyle: And it’s kind of like, I imagine it almost like Les Claypool on that one poster on that one weird contraption that he rides. Or similar to the tractor that Frank Zappa rides on. Players: Oh, yeah. Yes. I gotcha. Kyle: Something like that. So, it gets cranked up and the legs start tapping and moving and it like, zips away, it moves about one-hundred and twenty feet.Goodrich: And we say “Wait, wait, wait! We started initiative! Where’r you going? Awww.”[Ali laughs] Kyle: So, it’s now like one-hundred and fifty-five feet away.Goodrich: Oh! Kay, well, never mind, uhhh…Ali: So, he’s gone. He’s out of here. Kyle: Yeah, that cart maneuverability. Goodrich: Yeah, I guess.Spurrier: Is he still facing us? Like, can we still see him? I’m sorry that’s what I should’ve-Kyle: Yes, you can still see him off in the distance, he’s about to crest the hill. So, that would take us to Randy!Spurrier: Cool, well my bow can do three-hundred and twenty feet so I’m going to shoot him.Ali: Yeahhhhhh!Kyle: Go ahead and get a shot on. Ali: Shahrp shooter!Goodrich: Shahrp shooter![All laughing]Kyle: Jeez.Goodrich: [quietly] Shahrp shooter!Spurrier: Randy gets out his Christmas bow.Goodrich: Aww!Spurrier: With little candy cane stripes. Kyle:  Little double entendre there.Goodrich: So festive!Spurrier: Oh, oooohhh! That is a seven plus six.Kyle: That is not going to hit. Spurrier: Ugh, Randy!Kyle: You wind up pegging one into the back of the cart, but yeah, that’s as good as it gets. Ali: Pop a tire? Kyle: It doesn’t have tires. Spurrier: Pop a wooden wheel.Ali:  Just uh, is the gas tank open? Whole cart explodes.[All laughing]Goodrich: Christmas is over.Ali: Anddd, it’s over.Kyle: It’ssss done. Kyle: Alright, so next up is gonna be Yashee. Ali: So, we’re all still standing there. Ali (as Yashee): What are we gonna do here guys? Ali: Are they surrounding us on all sides? Kyle: No, they’re not surrounding you they’re just in front of you. Ali: No, I’m just trying to get an idea of-Kyle: You could run away if you wanted to. [All laughing]Goodrich: And, back to school. Kyle: And, done here. Spurrier: Splash, help! Kyle: Episode over! Goodrich: Yeah, can we use the Ira Glass and call Splash? Or, oh it’s not my turn.Ali: Splash is on vacation. Goodrich: Christmas vacation. Ali: We told him we wouldn’t bother him and his family. Kyle: It’s true, you did. That’s cannon now, she said it. You can’t bother him. Ali: He said don’t call me anymore. [All laughing]Ali (as Yashee): Well we gotta do something about this guys, they’re attacking the children!Goodrich: Okay, if I have an idea, but it’s not my turn in initiative am I allowed to say it out loud? Like how does that work? Kyle: Nah, you gotta wait on your turn. Goodrich: Okay. Kyle: But it’s coming up next!Ali: Oh no! What if I’m like-Ali (as Yashee): Any ideas guys?Kyle: Yeah, I would let you, you could respond. I know it’s stupid pedantic, but, you know-Goodrich: Okay, so Ali’s asking us on her turn and I can say my idea? That’s how this works. Kyle: I mean, right now you haven’t really engaged with any of them, they’re kind of still attacking towns people, but-Ali: So, I turn to the guys and I’m like-Ali (as Yashee): Guys, you want to make this a team effort? What do we… I mean?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, well, so here’s what I’m thinkin’, he played a minor tune, so maybe we just need to make this into a major situation again and maybe that’ll fix some of this mess. Spurrier (as Randy): Fluid solvin’ all them toys. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Ali: Do these count as animals? Or are they…?Kyle: You do not know. Ali: Okay what’s the closest little toy next to me that’s all evil? That I can maybe…?Kyle: An elephant. Ali: And maybe a small one. Kyle: They’re all small. Ali: Is it like an elephant sized elephant?Kyle: No, it’s small. It’s like a toy. Ali: What’s the elephant doing right now? Kyle: It is chasing after a child.Ali: Alright, I’m gonna go-Kyle: With really sharp tusks. Ali: Okay, I am going to-Goodrich: With malicious intent, you would say.Kyle: Yes.Ali: I’m going to try to grab the elephant and hold it down and smash it with a hammer.Kyle: Okay. Go ahead and give me a strength-based grapple. Ali: That’s going to be a fourteen plus three. Kyle: Okay, you grab it. You wanna smash it? Ali: Okay, I just wanna smash it until it, I don’t know, does it have lights on it that turn off? Kyle: No. Go ahead and roll an attack. Ali: Until I feel like it’s-Kyle: Working anymore. Ali: Incapacitated. Kyle: Okay, yeah, go ahead and give me some of that damage roll with your hammer. Ali: Oh, great! Okay, so that is five plus three.Kyle: You smash it. It is smashed and broken. Ali: Yay! Alright, so what do I find inside?Kyle: It’s made of wood.Spurrier: Evil. Ali: Wood!? Kyle: Yeah, it’s wood and you see the inlays for the metal tusks. Ali: Oh, okay. Well, I’ll go ahead and show you guys my broken elephant made of wood. Ali (as Yashee): It’s made of wood guys! That’s a plus. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Awesome, there’s like what? Thirty more? Kyle: Yeah, you’re holding this up and-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): I mean! Not to take away your great accomplishment, but-Ali (laughing): No, no it’s okay!Kyle: You’re holding this up and you’re showing the rest of the group and you notice all of the toys are looking at you three now. Goodrich: Yes! Draw their attention, away from the kids.Spurrier: Save the kids!Kyle: And they are starting to approach.Ali: Welp. Kyle: That would take it to Raz’uls turn.Goodrich: So, all of them are now engaging us. Kyle: Mm-hmm, yes. Goodrich: So, the town’s folk we could consider safe for the time being.Kyle: Yes. Safe, but injured. Goodrich: Okay… injured, really? Kyle: I mean, you know-Goodrich: But it’s Christmas![Ali laughs]Kyle: What do you think happened at the beginning of The Santa Clause? Santa died. [All laughing]Goodrich: Okay. Ali: That’s a fair point. Goodrich: Okay, so here’s what I’m gonna do Kyle. Kyle: What are you gonna do? Tell me.Goodrich: So, um-Kyle: Oh boy, don’t let the ball drop [makes a clinking sound].Goodrich: I wanna ask you something kind of above the table, Kyle, since you’re our benevolent Christmas, uhhh- Spurrier: Carol.Goodrich: Carol.[Ali laughs]Goodrich: Do you think since it’s, ya know, Christmas time and the holidays that you could let Raz’ul maybe transform into what he intends to transform into? Kyle: Oh. Uhhhh-Goodrich: Just this one time! Just since it’s a special. Ali: Maybe only holiday creatures! One through ten. Goodrich: Yeah! I want you to imagine… imagine a personification of your Dungeon Maestro self and Raz’ul’s sitting on your lap and you’re Santa.Kyle: Hmmmmm. I like this. Ali: Oh Raz’ul.Goodrich: And looking up at you and saying “Kyle, Kyle, all I want for Christmas is to be able to transform into what I want to transform into.” Kyle: I tell you what, yes. Yes, we’ll go ahead and do it for this special, to make it special. Goodrich: Yeah! Spurrier: Ooohhh. Kyle: And let’s go ahead and do this, I’ll say Yashee, you’re not claustrophobic, and-Goodrich: You like forks instead of spoons. [All laughing]Ali: Great. Kyle: Yeah, I wanted to get rid of a bad affect, since we’re doing something nice. And Randy, why not, you can read!![All laughing]Ali: Hell yeah!Spurrier: I can read and count and mmm.Kyle: Yeah, past twenty. Spurrier: Yeah, I can count all the toys that are trying to kill us!Goodrich: Aww.[All laughing]Kyle: We won’t worry about the rest of it. Goodrich: Randy’s like The Count now. ‘One toy elephant! Ah ah ah!’Kyle: I can figure out everything.Goodrich: Yeah!Kyle: Okay, so what are you gonna do with that new found knowledge? Spurrier: Yes!Goodrich: Okay, yes, what I want to do then, and this will be within my challenge rating, is I want to transform into an elk, but instead of an elk, Kyle, can it be-Spurrier and Goodrich (in unison): A reindeer. Kyle: Yeah!Goodrich: And can my reindeer also, you know what I’m gonna ask.Kyle: Fly?!Goodrich: Maybe…?Kyle: Oh, man, that’s really… You know what? Special. Go for it. Goodrich: Yeah!! Alright. Spurrier: Oh man!Kyle: You have a flight movement of thirty feet. Goodrich: Awesome! Man, best Christmas ever.Kyle: Yeah, it’s pretty good. Goodrich: Okay, and can he have a little shiny red nose too? Kyle: Uh, sure, yeah. Goodrich (sarcastically): No!Kyle: No effects! Just, you know-Ali: You’ve taken it too far. [All laughing]Goodrich: Okay I can’t shoot like lasers out of it or anything. Kyle: No. Goodrich: So, with my newfound knowledge I picture this reindeer in my minds’ eye and I’m like “Come on Raz’ul, you can do this, we got this.” And I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): “Hhhyyyuuhhh! [voice modulation starts] And I’m a reindeer!” Kyle: Yeah!Ali: Alright!Goodrich: And I look at you guys and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): {voice modulated] Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up let’s go.”[All laughing]Goodrich: And I wanna just charge right at them, but I wanna do like a flying charge, like the Pegasus in Fantasia when they charge with their wings. I wanna do that with my antlers down, my nose all shining bright. Kyle: Okay. Goodrich: I wanna just take them out.Kyle: Alright, yeah. Go ahead and roll me a melee attack. Goodrich: And it’s a six.  Kyle: What’s the bonus? Goodrich: So, I get a six plus three.Kyle: Six plus three. Goodrich: Nine.Kyle: Sorry, it’s gonna miss. You fly in and you bare your antlers down and they’re all short enough and spaced out enough to where your horns just kind of like, scrape in the dirt. Goodrich: It’s my first time flying, so.Kyle: Yeah, you know, you’re still getting a feel for it. Spurrier: Do you recall, the most awkward reindeer of all? [All laughing]Goodrich (singing): Raz’ul the red-nosed reindeer, had a really bad attack roll. Kyle: Okay, and we are gonna go to the toys. I’m gonna say one of the balls is gonna try to bounce attack Raz’ul. Ten does not hit, so it does another spin dash attack and you’re flying past and it just misses as it’s going through. I’m gonna do about three attacks of opportunity for you doing movement past these little guys. One elephant which, that does hit, and a dino does hit. Okay, let me roll some damage. You wind up taking six damage as you’re bearing your antlers down Goodrich. Two of the little toys wind up aiming their weapons at you and you get cut up a little bit by elephant tusks-Goodrich: The toys aim their weapons at me? Great. Kyle: Yeah, yeah, they wind up moving themselves to attack you. Goodrich: Gotcha. Kyle: You take a little tusking from an elephant and you also take a little bit of a hit from a stegosaurus. Goodrich: Oh boy.Ali: Ooh. Kyle: But, let’s see, Yashee-Goodrich: Um, really quick, let me roll for my elk HP which is gonna be two D10 plus two. So here is… oh my gosh. Kyle: Yes. [Ali laughs]Goodrich: So, eleven, so I got thirteen, which is the recommended one again, so-Kyle: How about it, they really know their stuff. Yashee, you’re being attacked by a couple of dinos and bears and bouncing balls. Ali: Oh my. Kyle: Yep. (quick chuckle) And, out of four that go after you only one hits. The bouncing ball lines up, careening in to you. It does its spin dash attack from ten feet away and hits you right in the gut, dealing you five damage. Ali: Not too bad, like my old dodge ball days. Kyle: So that is gonna be the toys that are gonna attack Yashee. Let’s do some for Randy. Thirteen does not hit Randy. Spurrier: Phe-ew.Kyle: That does, and that does too, that does not. So, you’re gonna take an attack from one of the bears as it’s-Spurrier: So, are they coming up on me now?Kyle: Yeah. Spurrier: Okay, cool. Kyle: Yeah, they’re making their way up on you and you notice the bears have little dagger claws and whatnot. You wind up taking seven damage as the bears start to claw at your bare feet. Which, that’s a little weird, but, ya know, hey, it happens. [All laughing]Kyle: So, we are back to the top. Wonderman still keeps careening off and eventually crests over the hill and is gone. The bear that’s in the back is still just marching forward through the group of toys and it’s just heading right to you. Ali: How big is that bear?Kyle: It’s about six feet tall. Spurrier: Mmmmm. Ali: I’m bigger than that bear. Kyle: It’s, you know, a really big looking toy stuffed bugbear. Kyle: So, that takes us to Randy. You’re up. Spurrier: Okay, Randy’s gonna lift up his shirt, as he’s wont to do, and out comes Eddie Izard the Gizzard Wizard and he’s dressed as, uh, well Santa, I guess. [All laughing]Spurrier: So, he comes out and he’s all festive. Spurrier (as Eddie - singing):  Eddie Izzard the Gizzard Wizard, Eddie Izzard the Gizzard Wizard. [All laughing]Spurrier: That’s all he’ll be saying. Ali: Beautiful. Kyle: Okay.Spurrier: But anyways, he’s gonna use his hand and gonna cast mage hand, my special roguish version. Kyle: Okay. Spurrier: So, these things weigh less than ten pounds, right? Kyle: Yeah. Spurrier: Awesome! Okay, good, good, good, good, good. He’s just gonna to come out and, in a range of thirty feet around me, I’m just gonna have Eddie just kind of smash them out of the way. Not destroy them, just knock them over and incapacitate them.Kyle: Just clear them out of the way?Spurrier: Yeah. Since I’m not actually attacking, how many could I do with that? Kyle: Let’s see, roll a D10 and we’ll say you knock over that many.Spurrier: Cool. That’s a five. Kyle: Cool, yeah there’s five knocked over prone. Spurrier (as Randy): Good job Eddie! Get back in. Goodrich: Hooray!Kyle: Then we’ll go on to Yashee.Ali: Okay, are these toys saying anything or making any sounds? It’s complete silence with just scary-Kyle: Yep, it’s just them walking around. You hear the sounds of their, ya know, little pitter-patter of footsteps. Ali: Alright, they’re not paying attention to the kids anymore, but what are all the kids doing? Kyle: All the kids are running away now that they have the opportunity to escape. Ali: Like, are their parents around? Or do they need some-Kyle: Yeah, parents are coming in and picking up kids. Ali: So, they’re all gonna be alright. Kyle: It’s kind of been chaotic since this all started and parents are trying to corral kids and this is their opportunity now that you three have drawn the focus.Ali: Alright, well in that case, I turn to the guys and say- Ali (as Yashee): Hey, so, obviously Wonderman cast some kind of magic on these toys. Is there any way we can work together, figure out how to take care of this? Cuz-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking. Can we just-Ali (as Yashee): I, ya know, I smashed that elephant and it was just wood inside. I mean, I don’t know how we’re gonna defeat these guys other than burning the whole town down or something. Spurrier (as Randy): I mean, did either of you guys hear when he was playing his weirdo flute?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Yeah, Yashee I don’t know if you heard, but there was like a minor melody that was going on during it.Ali (as Yashee): What?Spurrier (as Randy): That march that we were playing. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Ali (as Yashee): Oh man, I must have been zoned out on the sparklers guys. Sorry.Spurrier (as Randy): They were good. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. So, maybe we just play the right melody, right? Play it all major and make all this stuff happy.Spurrier (as Randy): Just play it again, yeah, it seemed like it was going okay.Goodrich: So, can we just do that? Can we say we play it? Kyle: Yeah. So, you try playing the major version and nothing seems to change. Goodrich: Oh. Spurrier: Ah. Well.Ali: What if we play all at the same time? Unison? Just one, two, three? Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah, do we play it louder? Turn it up a little bit more?Kyle: You play it louder and this is taking a little bit of action so I’m just gonna roll one thing for an attack. Okay, so I’m gonna do this.Goodrich: Oh, I’m a reindeer though, so like-[All laughing]Ali: You can just fly up while they’re attacking us. We hop on your back. Spurrier: We can just like… if reindeers can sing you can just sing a little melody. Goodrich: Yeah, I just do it like [voice modulation starts] hmm hmm hmmm hmmm hmmm. [Ali laughs]Kyle: Okay, so you each take like twelve damage. As you’re trying out these songs the little toys are converging on you as best they can. Goodrich: Can I say that I banked and came flying back towards us to talk to you guys about that and then as I take the damage I pop out back into normal Raz’ul because I’m out of reindeer action.Kyle: Yeah, okay. You tried playing the major rendition of the song.Ali: Maybe let’s try playing it the minor way he did? Goodrich: Okay.Spurrier: Maybe it’d give us control, yeah. Kyle: Okay, you try that and nothing seems to change. Ali: Okay. Spurrier: Uhhh…Goodrich: Let’s try mixolydian? [All laughing]Ali: Oh! Play it backwards?Goodrich: Oh, yeah! Just drop the needle and…Spurrier: Vrrrrrrrr.Goodrich: [laughing] Yeah, spin the turntable back. Ali: Just the melody backwards?Kyle: The major or the minor?Ali: Ooohhh. The minor? Goodrich: Yeah, let’s do it. Spurrier: Since the minor was the catalyst, yeah, I guess. Kyle: Okay. You start playing the melody backwards in minor and the toys seem to all stop attacking. Goodrich: Oh, nice!Ali: Oooooohhh! Spurrier: Hey!Kyle: They kind of lower their arms and just stand there. The tall teddy bugbear continues to march though. Goodrich: Can we play it faster?Ali: Is it still my turn? Or are we not in rounds at this point? Kyle: No, they’ve all stopped so we’ll take it out of combat.Ali: I was gonna say, if the bugbear – are we calling it a bugbear? Kyle and Goodrich (in unison): Teddy bugbear. Ali: [laughing] Teddy bugbear. Ali: Does the teddy bugbear look like it’s gonna be something that’s going to attack me? I mean, it’s still walking. Kyle: It hasn’t attacked anybody so far; it’s just walking through the group and it’s just walking up to you. Goodrich: It just wants a big Christmas hug!Ali: Just coming right up to us? Kyle: It’s marching, like in a marching fashion yeah. Ali: Alright, I’m just gonna go down there to make sure it’s not coming up and doing anything. I want to get in front of it and tell it to stop or put my hand out. Kyle: You get in front of it and it walks right into your chest and, give me a strength check. [Goodrich laughs]Ali: That’s us, two plus three. Kyle: Two plus three? Okay, so you put your hand up on its chest to stop it-Goodrich: Can you just put your arms out like you want a big hug? [All laughing]Kyle: A big bugbear hug?Ali: Chest bump!Kyle: But yeah, you put your hand up to stop it and it just keeps walking and you’re trying to stop it but you’re being pushed back by the force of it walking. It’s like something is not going to stop this from walking. Raz’ul, Randy, you see Yashee go over trying to stop the teddy bugbear unsuccessfully. Goodrich: Okay, is this? We don’t know if this is an animal or another toy. Kyle: You don’t know. Goodrich: Okay, well I guess I will try to talk to it with-Ali: I yell out-Ali (as Yashee): It’s very strong![All laughing]Ali (as Yashee): It’s not stopping guys. Goodrich: Well I’m gonna do speak with animals. So, I say-Goodrich (singing as Raz’ul): [to the tune of Here Comes Santa Claus] Speak with animals, speak with animals, on this festive day. Creatures come along and talk to Raz’ul oh hooray![All laughing]Kyle: Alright. Goodrich: So, I say to this big bugbear-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey man, you cookin’ in there? You a big old… you a big old bear? Or are you just a toy, buddy?Ali: What you got in there? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): What you got in there? Kyle: You don’t hear a response at all. It just keeps marching and pushing Yashee as she’s trying to stop him. Goodrich: I don’t think I’ll ever be able to talk to an animal.Kyle: I have to say-Goodrich: Like a good druid! Kyle: Just to let you know bugbears are goblinoids, they are not beasts. Goodrich: Oh. Well.Kyle: But this isn’t either anyway. Goodrich: I mean, it seems like a special bugbear though. You never know, it’s Christmas, so.Ali: Yeah, yeah.Kyle: Anybody else wanna try anything? Goodrich: [laughing] Nah! Spurrier: Oh, wait, okay-Goodrich: He’s not hurting anybody, he’s just walking.Spurrier: He’s fine, he’s fine. Okay, so, even though someone’s not around, as long as I know what they look like I can disguise myself, right? Kyle: Yeah. Spurrier: Okay, cool. So, I’m gonna disguise myself as Wonderman.Kyle: Okay. Spurrier: Randy pulls out his organ and starts to sing. Spurrier (singing as Randy): [to the tune of Jingle Bell Rock] Randy’s gonna, Randy’s gonna disguise himself. He’s gonna hide and feel so alive. Oh yeah.Kyle: [laughing] Yeah.Goodrich (continuing the tune): Changing and changing, every day.Kyle: Alright.Spurrier (continuing): Until that Wonderman starts to pay!Goodrich: Oooh. Kyle: So, what are you going to do as Wonderman? Spurrier: I’m gonna go up to the bear and try to talk to it.Kyle: Okay. You go up to it and try to talk to it and there’s no response, but you start to hear a ‘mmm, mmm, mmm!’ come from inside. Spurrier: Hmmmm. From the bear. I turn to you guys-Spurrier (as Randy): Dude! We gotta bust this thing open!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh man, okay.Spurrier (as Randy): There’s a boy in here. Goodrich: Are you sure that wasn’t Eddie? [All laughing]Goodrich: He’s got his own little Christmas Eddie inside!Spurrier: He’s too busy drinking nog. Goodrich: [laughing] Oh yeah!Kyle: Knocking back some nog. Goodrich: Okay, so-Kyle: What do?Goodrich: Can we attack it? I guess? Kyle: Yes, you can. Spurrier: Let’s do some surgery!Ali: Wait, we’re gonna attack it? Kyle: That’s what he said. Do it. Goodrich: Is that bad? Ali: It might be a big stuffed animal that, it’s just inside of it. Can I check for like a zipper?Kyle: Yeah, go ahead and give me an investigation. Ali: Okay, that’s a thirteen.Kyle: Yeah, you notice a zipper on the back. Goodrich: [laughing] Oh my gosh![Goodrich and Spurrier laugh]Ali: So as Raz’ul, I don’t know, uh, comes at it.Goodrich: I take my axe I’m just like, so mad-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): None of these animals ever wanna talk to me! I hate it man! I’m such a bad druid! I’m not in the Christmas spirit anymore! Goodrich: And I just take Usumptin off my back and I’m about to just decapitate this thing, and-Ali: And I lift my arm up and I grab your axe and I’m like-Ali (as Yashee): Wait a second, wait a second. There’s a zipper bro.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh. Ali (as Yashee): I just go back there and zzzzzrrrrrrpppp.[All laughing]Kyle: Okay! So yeah, you unzip the back of it and you notice like the head can come off and everything, but it falls down, like the outfit falls down and everything and there’s a man inside. But the teddy bear head is still on him and he’s still marching forward and he marches out of the outfit. Ali: And we can’t pull the head off?Kyle: Yeah, you can pull that off. Goodrich: Well it’s like, it seems like-Kyle: All you did was unzip the thing so just the bottom half fell off.Ali: Okay.Goodrich: Well this seems like a Beetzart Deadmau5 or Daft Punk, like is it gonna disgrace him if we remove his helmet?Ali: We’re the only ones around.Goodrich: Oh.Kyle: No, the entire town’s around watching.Goodrich: Oh man.Ali: Oh. Kyle: But yeah, you can, you know.Ali: Oh, well he’s still walking so I’m gonna try to take his head off. Spurrier: He’s like a luchador.Ali: Or, not his head, the bear head.Kyle: Yeah, okay.Ali: I don’t wanna pull too hard in case his head does come off with it. So, I wanna kind of ease it off there. Wiggle it around a little. Kyle: Alright, yeah. You take it, you ease it off and everything, and you pull it off and you notice that standing there is Winter Wonderman.Goodrich: What!?Ali: Uh-oh.Spurrier: Well. Kyle: And he’s just looking at you with wide open eyes and his mouth is gagged and he’s just marching.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well if you’re here then who was that clown on the sleigh, err, cart?Kyle: Again, he’s gagged.Goodrich: Oh, he’s gagged?Kyle: Yeah, yeah, he’s gagged.Goodrich: Oh, well then, I get the gag off. Kyle: Alright, you pull the gag off and he’s just like ‘Oh thank god!’Ali: And he’s still moving?Kyle: Yeah, he’s still marching. This is all happening while he’s marching. He’s just like-Kyle (as Wonderman): Oh, thank god! It looked like you we’re about to attack me. I can’t stop, I’m under some spell from my sister, Holly Wonderman. I can’t stop moving. I don’t know what the spell is though. I’m not familiar.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Well listen, why don’t you keep getting your steps in and then we’ll go take care of your sister. You got any tips? Or what?Kyle: Well, you three go ahead and give me an arcana check real quick. Y’all know a little bit about some magics. [Sound of Dice Rolling]Kyle: You gotta change it, you know you gotta change it.Goodrich: I know! I don’t know how I didn’t think I’d roll a twenty this round! I rolled a natural twenty. Ali (singing): [to the tune of Twelve Days of Christmas] One natural twenty! One natural twenty! One natural twenty! Goodrich and Spurrier: [joining the song] One natural twent!!Kyle: I think that’s good right there! That’s it, nailed it. Goodrich: Nailed it!Kyle: Alright, Goodrich got that natural twenty. So, Randy?Spurrier: A five, plus one. Kyle. No. [All laughing]Kyle: Alright. Yashee?Ali: Two. Kyle: Oh man. Okay, yeah, so Raz’ul you’re the only one who really recognizes this spell. You notice there’s something glossing over his eyes and you recognize that he’s under the effects of what’s called a geas spell. And you know that this spell commands a person to do a specific action for like thirty days and you’d really need somebody who has the ability to remove a curse or dispel magic to be able to stop the effects of the geas spell. Goodrich: Can I just like, shout that? Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Does anyone here know dispel magic?Ali (as Yashee): Excuse me!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Looks like we got a case of a geas spell over here. Kyle: Yeah, there’s a cleric. Goodrich: Oh good! Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Hey!Kyle: He’s tending to an adult who was helping a kid, and he stands up and he says-Kyle (as Cleric): Well if you need somebody to dispel some magic, I could probably take care of that for you. What seems to be the problem?Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Oh man, a geas spell, looks like. Need some dispel magic on this feller. Kyle (as Cleric): Yes, yes of course. Well, let me take care of this real quick.Kyle: And he goes over and he begins a prayer and a warming light flows over him and a sigil appears. Goodrich: Yeah. Does he say [to the tune of Oh Come All Ye Faithful] ‘Oh come all ye dispel magic! Get up out this person!’Kyle: Yeah, [singing] ‘Stop marching right now or else you’ll probably hurt yourself.’ No yeah, you cast that and-Goodrich: [singing] Comeeee! Goodrich: Nah, I’m just playing. Kyle: You see Winter Wonderman’s arms stop marching and his legs finally stop. Goodrich: [makes robot shut-down noise]Kyle: And he just kind of collapses into a pile and he’s just on the ground. Goodrich: Is it super cool, like a dance move? Slow motion, Jabbawockeez style.Kyle: Yeah, it’s very slow. Just like, you know, like falling down. Goodrich: Awesome.Kyle: But he’s down on the ground and he’s just like-Kyle (as Wonderman): Oh, that’s much better. Thank you so much. Okay!Kyle: And he’s lying on the ground and he’s looking up at you two and he’s like-Kyle (as Wonderman): You might have to come down to my level a little bit, I can’t really move too much right now.Ali: I guess I’ll squat down. Goodrich: Yeah, you trying to be funny? Kyle: Yeah, no, he’s just lying there. It doesn’t seem like he can move.Goodrich: I know, I’m just playin.Spurrier: I come over and get right up in his face cuz I still look like him and I just go ‘Hi.’[All Laughing]Kyle (as Wonderman): Yes, no, that was very shocking to see. I thought my sister had maybe stuck around. See, she has been apparently parading around as me, trying to change the flow of our company from being simple toy makers that bring joy and love to kids! To wanting to make weaponized toys for the Bureau of Weaponry. Spurrier (as Randy): [sighs] A corporate Beetzart, I tell you what. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Ugghhhh, just the worst. Trying to commercialize this holiday.Spurrier (as Randy): The war machine. [Goodrich Laughs]Kyle (as Wonderman): Yes, I mean, my sister betrayed me and, [huffs], I’m really surprised by this. I should have acknowledged at least my chief engineer’s warnings. Kan let me know that my sister had been talking about this and came to me, but I couldn’t believe him. You don’t think family would do those kinds of things to you. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Especially on Christmas. [Ali Laughs]Kyle (as Wonderman): What’s Christmas?Goodrich: Right! So, what is this holiday called? Is it called something, or?Kyle: It’s the March of the Toys.Ali: Is that just an event unto itself?Kyle: Yeah, it’s just an event in Beln.Goodrich: So, this is sort of like a Hogswatch sort of thing? Terry Pratchett style? It’s like Christmas, it’s just called something else. March of the Toys, I guess. Ali: Annual, charitable, festive event.Spurrier: And this doesn’t happen all around Beetzart, it’s just in this one place.Kyle: Just in Beln. Goodrich: Okay.Spurrier: Little regional feller. Goodrich: So, rewind [makes rewind sound].Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, especially on March of the Toys day! I mean, honestly. Kyle (as Wonderman): Absolutely. I mean, I grew up in Beln, many years ago, and I always like coming back and helping the kids who don’t always have parents that can afford toys to have toys. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. Kyle (as Wonderman): You know, it was something I… I enjoyed playing with the sticks and stones I could find as a kid, and my imagination was well enough to do that, but, some of the kids these days-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah, tell me about it. [Ali and Spurrier Laugh]Kyle (as Wonderman): So maybe you can help actually save this event and bring back some of the toys that I have in my toy vault. I have a section in there that’s the emergency stash. So, makes sure that you at least procure those and you should be able to use the cart. This is all barring that you’re able to stop Holly. See if you can talk her down and get her to change her mind about all this, because it’s really concerning that she was wanting to go this route. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Yeah. Ali (as Yashee): Any clue where you think she might have headed towards? She went that way.Ali: And I point to where we last saw her. Kyle (as Wonderman): She must be heading back to the factory.Kyle: So, he tells you exactly where the factory is. Kyle (as Wonderman): Just take this main road out and head north and eventually you get there, you’ll pass it on your way. Goodrich: Well first of all I turn to him and I say-Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, Wonderman, listen, first of all -Chaos Sauce- nice to meet you. Goodrich: And I hand him one of our business cards. Kyle: He takes it.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): We do holiday events.Kyle: You place it in his hand because he can’t move his hand.Goodrich: Right, yeah, I close his fingers over it.Ali: [laughing] Just give him a little tap. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Any events you got; we’re playing around.Goodrich: I go into our whole spiel. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right, send us a line if you need music for an event. Secondly – maybe I could just transform into another flying reindeer. I’ve got one transformation in me, and just zip us over there real quick.Kyle: I guess a flying reindeer could carry both Yashee and Randy.Goodrich: And it’s Christmas, er, March of the Toys.Kyle: Yeah. Yeah, why not!Goodrich: It can be a March of the Toys miracle. Kyle: How long does a transformation last? One hour? Spurrier: I think it does.Goodrich: It lasts one… Christmas?Kyle: One, oh no, it’s one hour-Spurrier: One March![All Laughing]Kyle: I think it lasts-Goodrich: It can last us long enough to get to the freakin’ toy stash, hopefully.Kyle: It’ll last you long enough to get to the toy thing. Goodrich: Okay. Kyle: Yeah, and he’s just like-Kyle (as Wonderman): Oh that’s, I was going to say you might want to procure some king of transportation to get there quicker. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Nah bro.Kyle (as Wonderman): Of course, it’s, probably what, about noon-thirty right now? Based off the sun. So, you want to get back before the sun goes down and the kids might have to go off to bed. Again, this is all for them. Goodrich: For the kids!Spurrier: The kids.Kyle (as Wonderman): So, you wanna rush on, and here, check in that front pocket down there. Just check in my… I can’t move my hands-Ali (as Yashee): Just go reach in Raz’ul.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, here. Kyle: You reach in there and-Ali (as Yashee): He’s got something in his pocket for you. Kyle: (singing) I’ve got something in my front pocket for you!Kyle: So, you reach in his pocket and you feel a key. And he saysKyle (as Wonderman): Take that, that will get you through the front door. Now, I will let you know, that my factory is a little different. It’s modifiable for toy creation and testing, so the structure itself on the inside can flow and change as deemed necessary for the purposes we need it for. I know that sounds confusing.Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Little bit. Kyle (as Wonderman): Basically-Spurrier (as Randy): It’s a modular factory? Kyle (as Wonderman): Yeah! It, kind of changes as we need it to. There’s a control booth, which I imagine my sister will more than likely be in. Goodrich: Subtext – we need to have enough Christmas Spirit and then it’ll show itself. [All Laughing]Kyle (as Wonderman): So, yes, I imagine that the factory settings have been changed. Kyle: No joke. [All Laughing]Kyle (as Wonderman): Also, the security systems I probably wouldn’t have any sway over. Also, of course, in my current state I will not be able to go with you. So, I will have to stay here until I feel better. If you just go do this real quick – make sure my sister’s okay, try to talk her down, get the emergency stock of toys, and, by all means, if you can secure the wand she’s using that is one of the keys to the Wonderman Toy Factory that allows us to animate the toys that we have and that’s how I’m able to do all of this.Ali (as Yashee): Oh! Kyle (as Wonderman): So, yeah, it’s a different type of magic, and it’s a little beefed up from your normal animate spells, but it’s always a lot of fun to see the kids smiles get really bright once the toys start moving. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Right. Kyle (as Wonderman): You know, most people don’t think the toys move, but then when you don’t look, they do. Somebody should make a play or something about that. [All Laughing]Goodrich: That’s too crazy, no one would do that.Spurrier: It’s too wild. Kyle: So, he says- Kyle (as Wonderman): By all means, the townspeople will take care of me.Kyle: The cleric looks at you and is just like-Kyle (as Cleric): I’ll be sure to take care of him and get him all propped up perfectly fine. Kyle: And he goes down, lifts him up, and starts to carry him off. Spurrier: Well, and I say to Mr. Wonderman-Spurrier (as Randy): What’s up with that flute? So, we need to know anything about that?Kyle (as Wonderman): Oh, well, I mean, I enjoy playing the flute so that was something to cop off. I imagine the toys that Holly is making now, maybe she’s changed something in the actual design or the magic. A trigger response might have been put into the imbuing of magic upon the toys. Spurrier (as Randy): Okay. Kyle (as Wonderman): But very clever work around to reverse, you know, use the retrograde of the actual music. Spurrier (as Randy): It was all Yashee.Kyle (as Wonderman): Ah, wow!Ali (as Yashee): Hey thanks. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): So, break the flute. Spurrier (as Randy): Take the flute.Kyle: He’s just laying there limp as this cleric as this cleric holds him, and then he walks off with Wonderman. And, yeah, you know where to go. Goodrich: So we do it!Ali: Alright. Spurrier: Transform!Goodrich: Nnnyyyrrroooooom!Ali: Let’s go Rudolph. Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Alright, hrrrrrrrrrrrrrr…. -which button do I press?-  hrrrrrrrrrr…. [voice modulation starts] [All Laughing]Kyle: That was a long’un!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay, let’s ride!Kyle: And as you’re about to take off you hear Wonderman scream-Kyle (as Wonderman): Don’t forget! My sister knows the factory very well so be careful!Goodrich (as Raz’ul): Okay.Kyle: And you take off!Goodrich: Are we all waving to him as we go? Kyle: You can’t, you don’t have hands. Goodrich: But, but…. Okay.Ali: You’re kind of pawing at the ground. Goodrich: [laughing] My back right leg’s like errr, bye!Kyle: That’s what reindeer look like when they fly. Goodrich: Yeah. Kyle: Alright! So, you zip on off to the factory and this is honestly taking longer than I thought it was going to, so we might have to break this up a little bit. So, you know what, how about a Christmas-y travel song?Goodrich: Ahh yeah!Ali: Ooh a reindeer song!Spurrier: Hooray!Goodrich: Reindeer song!Kyle: We’re gonna play a reindeer games. So, yeah let’s go ahead and break and roll up some dice. [Transition music]Goodrich: So, I guess with this, since I’m a reindeer I’ll just sing. I can’t quite justify playing my guitar as a reindeer, so-Spurrier: Could you sing with your pedal on? Goodrich: [laughing] I could try! I’ve never tried.Kyle: Hell yes. That’d be good. Goodrich: Okay! Well we’ll get to it, let’s roll the chord dice. Kyle: We ready to roll the chord dice?[sound of dice rolling]Goodrich: D minor! Kyle: I actually got a G.[players cheer]Goodrich: It’s a Christmas miracle!Kyle: [quietly singing] Hey G.Ali: Is that just a re-roll? Spurrier and Goodrich (in unison): Yeah.Ali: Well it’s gone now.Goodrich: It’s gone now. Kyle: It doesn’t count if it’s not on the table. Spurrier: And it’s gone. Ali: I picked it up, sorry.Goodrich: Wow! Another re-roll. Spurrier: Whoa.Goodrich: Another Christmas miracle. Ali: G!Spurrier: Hey G. Kyle: Yay. Goodrich: Lookin’ at you… D minor!Ali: What did you have Kyle?Kyle: I had a G.Goodrich: It’s Christmas!Kyle: So, we have one, two, five. Ali: Well we also have C.Spurrier: Yeah. Kyle: One, two, and five.Spurrier: That’ll be enough. Goodrich: Two, five, one!Kyle: Perfect.Ali: It’s perfect.Goodrich: That should be easy! Ali: Okay, I have to roll my drums.Kyle: That’s right.Ali: Alrighty. Okay, that’s tails.Kyle: Okay.Ali: Twenty-eight. Okay, pattern twenty-eight’s gonna be-Goodrich: Christmas![Spurrier laughs]Ali: Uhh, oh, what is that? Maybe bold rock? BLD rock.Spurrier: Yeah, I think bold. Ali: Bold.Goodrich: Bold. Spurrier: Or blood rock?Goodrich: [laughing] Blood rock? Ali: Blood rock?Kyle: Blood.Ali: Let’s just see what it says.Goodrich: Blood.Kyle: Blood rock.Ali: Yeah, blood rock, okay, sure!Goodrich: Wait, does is say blood rock or bold rock? Ali: It’s just BLD rock. Kyle: Blood rock.Goodrich: We’ll say blood rock. Spurrier: It means blood rock. Kyle: It’s perfect, all holiday.Ali: Oh, perfect, is that an actual thing? Blood rock? Kyle: Oh yeah! You haven’t heard? Of all those sweet blood rock bands?Ali: No. No, I haven’t. Goodrich: Especially around Christmas Time.Kyle: I’m pretty sure O Negative is a blood rock band. Ali: Wow. Alright, well and my, oh so close, my kit’s twenty-nine, so that’s pretty close. Which is hip- hop three!Goodrich: Alright!Spurrier: Hip-hop blood rock. [Goodrich laughs]Kyle: Right on man. Spurrier: It’s Christmas. Kyle: Oh man.Goodrich: Thank goodness we learned seventh chords. [Music transitions]Kyle: Hey everyone it’s your Dungeon Maestro Kyle here.

Later![Music transitions][Melodic bells chime]Kyle: We see a log cabin with a smoking chimney near the edge of a forest. A man chops wood amidst a light flurry of snow whipping through the air. He looks up from his work towards the porch where his wife is helping their child take their first steps into the winter snow. The child looks around with wonder in their eyes and then looks to the sky. The child begins to babble excitedly and points up. The parents look in the direction to see a red dot in the sky that is getting bigger and bigger. As this dot gets closer, they see two figures riding atop a flying reindeer with a red nose. Music begins to fill their small portion of the world. [Drums begin to play]Goodrich(singing): [voice modulated] Flying so high, in a holiday sky.[Piano joins in]Goodrich(singing): [voice modulated] Flying so high, in a holiday sky. Evergreen trees all covered in snow surround the towns that pass below. Air so crisp, so fresh, so clean makes it feel like a dream. Flying so high, in a holiday sky. Flying so high, in a holiday sky. Cruising so fast all along the land, smelling baked goods and a holiday ham, head up in the clouds filled with holiday cheer, antlers on my head I’m a reindeer. So high, in a holiday sky. Flying so high, in a holiday sky. Flying so highhhhhhh, in a holidaaaaay sky. [Music ends]"
