[TTAZZ theme song plays]
Griffin: Hey everybody, welcome to The The Adventure Zone Zone, a podcast about the rest of our podcast. We’re talkin’ about our own podcast that we make. It’s kinda like Talking Dead if the creators of Walking Dead talked about their own show and how dope it was, so it’s kind of a snake eating it’s own tail, but it’s also like a snake sucking its own dick. Kind of, technically.
Travis: Griffin, I love that you’re explaining this, like, like we haven’t been releasing The The Adventure Zone Zone on every off-week since we started the podcast.
Griffin: On the fuckin’ deep web, yeah. I put it up on the Big Gulp RSS feed.
Travis: Yeah, everybody’s been getting it, right? Like, I’ve been putting a lot of work into The The Adventure Zone Zone.
Justin: Uh, it’s MaxFunDrive. Should we introduce ourselves? It must be so, so weird for regular listeners to hear us talking with our normal voices.
Griffin: [laughing]
Clint:: ‘Cause we always do character voices, right?
Justin: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Clint:: Yeah. Well, I got some surprises for you.
Justin: [deadpan] Oh, wow, I’m really looking forward to it. [deadpan] My name’s Justin McElroy, I play the role of Taako. [laughs]
Clint:: [chuckling]
Travis: My name is Travis McElroy and I inhabit Magnus Burnsides.
Griffin: Dad?
Clint:: My name is Clint McElroy and I am Merle High… church. Church, not tower. Huh-uh.
Griffin: I’m—I’m Griffin McElroy and I play the role of fuckin’... Klaarg, Gundren, Barry Bluejeans, Yeemick, The Director, Killian, Kurtze, Jenkins, Angus, Jess, uh…
Clint:: [doing a voice] Davenport!
Griffin: Davenport, yeah, that’s me. Actually, Davenport? Not a lot of people know this, is the guy from Wings. With Steven…him.
Justin: Steven Weber?
Clint:: Steven Weber?
Travis: Steven Weber?
Griffin: Steven W…
Justin: Travis’s friend, Steven Weber?
Travis: My dear, dear friend Steven Weber?
Griffin: Steven Weber does Davenport—
Travis: Who actually knows that this show exists. I told him about it once at a party and he was...
Griffin: That—I doubt—I doubt—
Travis: …I was about to say fascinated but I feel like that’s probably not true.
Griffin: I doubt very much that information may be stayed up in the—the spongy brain of Steven Weber. I doubt that information still exists in his mind sponge.
Clint:: It—it—it probably didn’t, it probably didn’t get past “ooh, look, they got those little weenies wrapped in bacon!”
Justin: [laughing]
Griffin: Yeah, that’s probably his priorities.
Justin: Yeah, if I’m triaging information for Steven Weber’s brain, I’m tossing out The Adven—the Dungeons and Dragons podcast in favor of pork-wrapped-pork.
Clint:: [chuckling]
Griffin: Uh, so this is gonna be weird. I didn’t—I was so excited to do The The Adventure Zone Zone because, like, I—I think there’s a market here for after-podcast discussion shows. But, typically in this type of medium, it’s not the people who make the shit talking about their own shit.
Justin: Right.
Travis: Well, can I make a suggestion?
Griffin: Please do.
Travis: What if we just kind of took turns asking each other questions and having some audience questions and—until we hit on, like, a conversation nugget. And then we mined it for all it was worth.
Griffin: Let’s dig for that nug.
Justin: Nope.
{technical ad break ~3:30}
Griffin: I do—I do wanna talk, though, it is the MaxFunDrive. That is why we’re doing this mid-week episode.
Justin: Yeah, let’s start there.
Griffin: MaxFunDrive, we are a member of the Maximum Fun organization. We have been for a very long time. We joined them with My Brother, My Brother and Me in 20...10? 2011? 2011. And we’ve been happily been a member for years. This network and the people who listen to it and donate to it have supported us and allowed us to branch out and do new stuff like The Adventure Zone.
Like, straight up, The Adventure Zone, it takes a lot of time to make and we kind of knew it would from the beginning and we just—we wouldn’t be able to do that if it was not for the donations and support. So, like, we—we’re gonna talk about the MaxFunDrive and how great it is to be a part of the network, but this show, this thing you’re listening to with your ears right now, would not exist if it was not for the Maximum Fun community and the MaxFunDrive.
Justin: Uh, so just to give you a quick run-down here, we’ll get more into this later. But if you’d like to give to the network, if you’d like—if you listen to just our show or a few shows on Max Fun, you can go to maximumfun.org/donate. We’ve got several different levels for ya. I wanna talk to you—let me just pick one at random here and let me tell you about the 20 dollar a month level. If you can pledge 20 dollars a month for the shows that you listen to on Maximum Fun, here’s what you’re gonna get. You’re gonna get the Max Fun adventure necessities kit. That is a- uh, sort of a multi tool, a paracord bracelet, some toilet tissue in like a travel container.
Clint:: Oooh!
Justin: And a hot cocoa mix. And you’re also gonna get a bandana with the original designs from your favorite podcast on the network, whichever podcast you pick.
Griffin: I’m gonna assume you’ll pick The Adventure Zone, and our bandana looks dope as fuck.
Justin: It’s a really good bandana, but! Maybe most fun of all is, you’re going to get the, uh… an archive. Access to a Maximum Fun archive, that has so much bonus content.
Griffin: It is a fuckin’ national treasure, book of secrets, dungeon of radio content.
Travis: I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say I think it’s 75 hours worth of material.
Justin: It’s several days.
Griffin: Not just of our show. There’s not 75 hours of The Adventure Zone. That would-
Travis: No, but there is! I’m very, very excited and I hope that you donate so you can listen to- I DM the bonus episode of The Adventure Zone, where we created a whole new world, all new characters, um, played through a puzzle dungeon. It was my first time ever DMing ever in my life, and it was incredibly fun and I’m pretty proud of the way it turned out so I hope everybody gets to check it out.
Griffin: We call it-
Clint:: And you did a great job, son.
Travis: Thank you Dad, finally he’s proud of me! [Laughter]
Travis: I’ve done it! I’ve waited you to say those words, Dad.
Clint:: Sing “Papa Can You Hear Me”.
Travis: No.
Griffin: I’m just-I’m just psyched that somebody else on this podcast now knows how fucking hard this is.
Travis: It’s so fucking hard, you guys.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s really tough. Anyway. We call it The Adventure Zone-- Are we calling it The Adventure Zone Steam or The Adventure Zone Nights.
Travis: I kinda like The Adventure Zone Nights.
Griffin: Uh-uh. Okay. Uh, yeah, we’re trying to also figure out-- we should talk about this now too-- it was a lot of fun and we really liked that world and we didn’t wanna just like suspend it, and then maybe return to it after we’re done with this campaign? After the core Adventure Zone campaign. So-- do we wanna commit to this right now? Do we wanna fuckin’, throw our hat over the fence?
Travis: Yeah, I say we do it. I wanna commit to-- if we hit the maxfun goal of five thousand new and upgrading donors, we will do at least three more Adventure Zone Nights episodes this year. And now, those will be only available to donors, so if you wanna hear ‘em, you’re gonna have to donate. But we will do more Adventure Zone Nights.
Justin: The cool thing is, if you donate just five dollars a month for like, the shows you listen to on the network, even if you just listen to our shows, it’s like two hours worth of podcasting fun for five bucks a month.
Griffin: More than that!
Justin: I think it’s pretty good.
Griffin: ‘Cause you also get the stuff we did last year which includes the live show that we did at L.A. podfest.
Justin: Well I mean like two-- two hours a month of this show for five bucks. It’s-
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Justin: -pretty good.
Travis: You pay more than that to see Deadpool. We break the fourth wall way more than he does.
Griffin: That’s true. And we say-
Clint:: Especially if you went every day.
Griffin: We make a lot more jokes about… wieners and boobs.
Travis: Well, uh-
Justin: maximumfun.org/donate is that address. {technical ad break ends ~8:00}
Justin: We’ll talk more about that in a second. First, I’d like to hear a question from dad.
Clint:: Okay!
Griffin: [silly voice] How do you play dungeons and dragons? I still don’t get it, I’m so-
Travis: [Yelling] How do dice work?
Griffin: Help me boys, help me boys—oh, boys, I swallowed all me dice! Oh no…
Travis: What am rolling?
Griffin: Oh dang, I got all my dice down in my pooper. [Laughter]
Clint:: Alright, that’s the first five checked off. [More laughter]
Griffin: I just wanna go ahead and like raise a concern that “I swallowed all my dice and now they’re stuck in my pooper” is not really a question as much as it is like, sort of a, cry for help.
Clint:: Well it is, but-
Justin: Declarative?
Travis: No, it’s not a question at all, Dad, there was no interrogative statement. It’s fact - you swallowed all your dice and they’re stuck in your pooper.
Griffin: Is the question “did I swallow all my dice and now they’re stuck in my pooper”? The answer is yes.
Clint:: Alright here’s the first one, off to a great start with this one. “Griffin, any advice for new GM’s?” Apparently general managers.
Griffin: New Griffin McElroys.
Travis: Game Master.
Clint:: “I am running my first campaign (long time player first time DM) and” - this is like a talk show - “and anything you might have would be helpful.” Lindsey is asking that. What kind of advice would you have for GM’s, which I can only-
Travis: Game Master.
Justin: No, Game Master is how you would refer to it in a like, an MMO. Like, somebody who works in like an MMO and like, logs in and -
Griffin: I don’t really understand like, for games like - so there’s, there’s lots of other RPG’s out there. There’s stuff like Pathfinder and uh, uh, I mean- uh- oh shit. Shadowrun, is another one. There’s like a ton of these pen and paper RPG’s and most of them use the term Game Master, not Dungeon Master, which I get, right, like, I think maybe we should adopt this terminology ‘cause how many fucking dungeons have you boys been in?
Justin: That’s true.
Travis: There’s the one.
Clint:: One?
Justin: Well I guess we’ve kinda been in like, an expansive dungeon.
Travis: The whole world’s a dungeon, you know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah, that’s true.
Justin: Yeah.
Justin: And it’s a vampire. [All at once]
Travis: Yeah!
Clint:: Yeah!
Griffin: Yeah!
Griffin: It’s funny you say that, I get books sent to me for Polygon stuff, ‘cause I write about DND sometimes for Polygon and so the Wizards of the Coast folks send me those books. Maybe it’s for the podcast, I don’t know, I’ve never really stopped to ask but they just-
Travis: I get them too and I don’t write for anybody.
Griffin: Oh really?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Oh that’s awesome! Okay, did you get Curse of Strahd? There’s a new, like-
Travis: No.
Griffin: They have these, like, campaign books that they send out and then like, you’re just supposed to read them and it’s a- it’s a really interesting way of doing it and I like perusing them, although I haven’t like straight up lifted anything from them, but they have like campaigns arranged in these books and then you like, read them and then you use them to lead your players to these campaigns.
And the most recent one is the Curse of Strahd, which is basically, like uh, basically like quest for glory four? The shadows of darkness. It’s just like, everything man, Frankenstein, vampires, all that shit, spooky stuff. I- that has nothing to do with anything, it’s just, you mentioning vampires made me think of it.
Justin: Can I just say if we could have a campaign where we meet a Frankenstein, I-
Travis: A Frankenstein’s monster.
Justin: Uh, no, a Frankenstein.
Clint:: No, a Frankenstein. Vic, let’s meet Victor.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Um-
Travis: Or like any Frankenstein, like his cousin, Steven Frankenstein.
Clint:: [Laughing] Alan Frankenstein.
Travis: “Please! Doctor Frankenstein was my father. Come on in!”
Griffin: “I dropped out of med school. It was a little intense.”
Travis: “I’m more of a musician. Do you like the oboe?”
Justin: Like, if-- Griffin, you’d just answer the question.
Clint:: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Griffin: No jokes!
Clint:: What piece of advice?
Griffin: I can’t like-- It’s- It’s hard to say because, what- what I do and what we here do in the show, like, I think it’s actually pretty different from what most dungeon master, game master people are gonna be doing, like, just playing around a table with their friends, because-- and we talked about this before, um, the folks who run like the official D&D podcast had me on as a guest a couple months ago and I talked at length about this, because like, I don’t think I do a lot of, like, proper DMing, ‘cause this thing is, as-- as much as it is a, like, actual play podcast, um, like, it’s also a very story-telling-heavy podcast, so there is like, there’s a lot narrative going on, and not a lot of like, for instance, long battles. Like, when I used to play D&D with a group in Ohio, when I was livin’ in Cincinnati, we would get together, and then like one night, one two hour session of us hanging out, would just be like, we get through a single big battle. And if we did that here--
Travis: Well that was also fourth edition though, when we used to--
Griffin: Fourth edition, yeah, it was-- it was, like, fourth edition was more of a tactics table-top board game. Fifth edition is, is more like about, I think, more about like, you know, I think creative solutions to problems and stuff like that. Which does move things along a little bit faster, that’s right Trav. But like, I-- I- you guys don’t get into that many fights in this podcast, right? And, and when you do, they typically aren’t prolonged. I, as a rule I try and keep them shorter than at least half the length of the episode, ‘cause I don’t think there’s anything particularly interesting about just getting into a big long fight. Um. Do you guys agree with like-- [crosstalk] I’m curious, I’m curious how you guys feel about that.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I, yeah.
Griffin: We’ve never really talked about that before-- [crosstalk]
Clint:: And we don’t, well we, we don’t really look for “conventional solutions” to-- [crosstalk] our fights.
Justin: Yeah that’s true. Like, like everybody’s on our dick about how we-- there was a big barrel-- [crosstalk] that, oh my god.
Clint:: [crosstalk] That red barrel is the albatross around our necks.
Justin: And people were like why, why didn’t they do it? And like some people were like, some people thought that they, like, it was like, a uh-- we were working around it like from a creative, strategic-- like, I mean or we just didn’t think that was the right-- like, we just didn’t listen. [Laughing]
Justin: Like a lot of times we just don’t listen-- [crosstalk] because--
Clint:: [crosstalk] We are not good at this.
Justin: It is really actually genuinely kinda tough to, and I’m sure Griffin’s doin’ the same thing many times over, but, it is tough to balance, like-- there are a lot of times, where like, if I was trying to win an encounter, I would, I would do different things than I do on the show-- [crosstalk]
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: [crosstalk] ‘cause it’s like really hard to find a balance between, like, okay I have to find something that’s like, funny or entertaining to do-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: [crosstalk] but like, makes sense from a gameplay perspective.
Travis: In real life, when I’ve played D&D outside of this show, the number of times that I’ve said, “Okay, tell me again” and if you take the number of times I do that actually on this show, multiply that by like ten. ‘Cause I’ll make-- [crosstalk] the DM just like, describe the set-up over and over again. And then I can do things like, pick out like, Oh! I’m supposed-- [crosstalk] to do this.
Justin: [crosstalk] Oh, god, I know. [crosstalk] It is so hard. It is so ha-- I’m like really, genuinely like, really bad at like imagining-- environments-- [crosstalk]
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: [crosstalk] in my head like, I think maybe the part of your brain that thinks of dumb shit to say may be the same part of your brain that imagines fantasy worlds. [Laughter]
Justin: ‘Cause like, I can’t keep two of ‘em spinning at the same time.
Griffin: Um, so like, all of this is to say, that, we do a lot-- I do a lot of stuff in the planning of the, the campaign and stuff. Um, to make it interesting radio. Um, and I-- you don’t have to do that when you’re playing around a table. And, I’m not saying one is better or worse than the other. It’s just like a different thing.
Some of the, like, people who have gotten more frustrated with our show--which is like totally fine--it’s all an expectations thing. Because if you expect us to just like, play straight D&D, then-- I imagine this podcast would actually be kinda disappointing. You-- the only like-- it’s just a different thing. And I think there’s something really entertaining about-- honestly that type of game, where the, the more actual-play, rules-heavy stuff, we can’t do that remotely. I-- I honest to god don’t think we could. [crosstalk]
Clint:: No, I don’t think so.
Griffin: [crosstalk] ‘Cause the, the amazing stuff that happens, like the, the-- my entry into D&D was the, was the, uh Wizards of the Coast Penny Arcade sessions that they would do. And then, like, at times, it would be hysterical when somebody like rolls a critical miss on like, the final hit against the boss, and everything just goes, shitty. Like, that’s, that’s some of the funniest shit ever, and, uh, you don’t get that when you’re playing remotely. [crosstalk]
Clint:: Yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] So like we have to do that too. So and-- I have not answered your question even remotely, like, I think, I think the most important thing for you to do is to just have, a-- the way I’ve structured this is to have a broad arc with micro-arcs inside of it. And just sort of like structuring it out like that is really helpful, because then you can let those micro-arcs be inspired by anything. Like, Rachel and I watched all of the Fast and the Furious movies. We bought the whole collection on Bluray and just like burned through ‘em in a weekend. That was Petals to the Metal. A lot of people thought it was Mad Max, it was actually-- I had written that like way before we had seen Mad Max. Although, certainly the similarities were there. It was all like, it was specifically the fuckin’ scene where Vin Diesel jumps out of the car to catch Letty in the air. Y’all know what I’m talkin’ bout, Fast-- [crosstalk] Fast 6?
Travis: [crosstalk] I-- I do. Yes.
Griffin: Like I saw that shit, and I was like, ba-ding! Like that’s it. That, literally that one moment from one Fast and the Furious movie was like, okay I’m’a do a whole arc about this. And then once-- all you need is that one, like, foothold, and literally the rest of the thing just sorta writes itself around it. I-- I think just like, not, not-- [sigh] --not adhering to the books.
Like read the books if you want. Buy the starter set and just read-- there’s basically, essentially a magazine-sized, like, uh, starter, for the Phandalin campaign. Which I’m really happy we used, ‘cause like, I was so nervous I had no idea what I was doing I had nothing written out when we started. I was just goin’ straight off that book, and three episodes in, I had-- I had a lot of stuff down, um, so like I don’t think there’s any problem with like starting out with somebody else’s stuff and then spiralling off into your own thing. Um, but don’t-- also don’t feel like you have to adhere to like, the book so completely, both in terms of like, the plot, and also like the setting and tone like the-- [crosstalk]
Travis: And like monsters and stuff. Do you like-- [crosstalk] adjust that--
Griffin: Yeah. [crosstalk] I don’t use any-- I don’t use anything from like the Monster Manual, I make all that shit up from whole cloth ‘cause it’s easy, it’s just like you come up with a thing and then you plug some numbers into it. It’s easy as hell to come up with your own stuff. And-- and-- uh, I think just sorta coming up with an idea and letting that be inspired by literally anything, like, uh, this, this whole Crystal Kingdom arc I was watchin’, uh, Alien and Aliens. And the idea--and it’s kind of spiralled off into something different, even from what that was--but I like the idea of this, like, sci-fi setting where you guys were being pursued.
That was like literally the whole impetus for, for Crystal Kingdom. And the fact that I really wanted to use a Vocaloid voice. But that’s what I’m talking about like those were two-- that was because the Vocaloid stuff was-- I was listening to a lot of, uh, Porter Robinson? Uh, who, who has an album called “Worlds” that has like Vocaloids on every track and it’s awesome. It’s like, [laughs] one of my favorite albums, maybe ever? And like listening to that I got inspired to do a Vocaloid voice and that inspired this arc, too. So like-- [crosstalk]
Clint:: And he was also one of the greatest artists ever in the Grand Ole Opry-- [crosstalk] he used to, team up with Dolly Parton, and uh-- [crosstalk] and Porter Davidson. (Quietly) whatever.
Griffin: No, that’s-- [crosstalk] different. Yeah Dolly Parton and Hatsune Miku [crosstalk] would get together and do some beautiful duets.
Travis: Can I, can I ask-- I have a question for Dad and Justin, can I ask?
Clint:: Certainly, go right ahead.
Travis: Um, so this-- Justin you had played once before and Dad this was your first foray into Dungeons and Dragons. When you approached character creation, what, what inspired you to make your characters the way that you did. Both in like, personality, and like the way that you decided to like, play them.
Clint:: Well for me, yeah I had never played D&D before, which, always-- [sarcasm] it shocks me how surprised people are, when they hear that. [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Well you’re a big old dorkus.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Well you’re just a big fuckin’ nerd.
Clint:: I know! And I wear it proudly. Um, but I-- I’ve also played a lot of fantasy-based video gaming and a lot of-- you know I’ve been on, I’ve been playing WoW for like-- [crosstalk] fifteen years--
Griffin: [crosstalk] Let’s-- I wanna specifically ask about WoW, do you feel like that-- when I started playing D&D fourth edition I was amazed, ‘cause it was the-- that was my first time playing D&D. I was amazed at how much, like video games have cribbed, from this system. That has evolved over time-- [crosstalk]
Clint:: Oh yeah.
Griffin: [crosstalk] but like there’s some stuff in here that is just like, “well that’s in every video game”.
Clint:: Well, and I’ve been playing though-- I mean, I was playing Zork [crosstalk] when it first came out.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, and Ultima, and all those--
Clint:: And, and I think, you learn a lot of things at a real basic level. Such as, when you guys started talking about the, the roles you wanted to play and what kinda characters you wanted to play, I mean it became real obvious that we were gonna need a, healer, type, um, so that-- you know I started from there, and then I kinda-- I kinda look at and saw the other races we had and we wanted to try something a little different and-- [crosstalk] and--
Griffin: [crosstalk] If memory serves, you-- you and Justin kinda re-rolled at the end of the first arc because you-- I mean you also used like the pre-generated sheets but then, after playing for a bit, and you got really into the player’s handbook, you, like, figured out that you wanted to-- [crosstalk]
Clint:: Yeah.
Griffin: The whole “nature” thing was not how you started but it’s where you are now. And I’m really glad ‘cause like-- [crosstalk] that’s my favorite thing about Merle.
Clint:: [crosstalk] And, it’s like we, it’s like we said before, you know what we’re tryin’ to do is not necessarily be overpowering, the best players, winnin’ all the time, overpowering every battle. We’re looking for scenarios that are fun! and interesting, and I mean it-- and it’s a different kinda fun it’s, funny-- [crosstalk]
Travis: I mean, ‘cause really, three players is really not, a full team, you’re supposed to have four-- [crosstalk] four or five.
Clint:: [crosstalk] Right.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Four or five, yeah.
Travis: So I mean we don’t, we don’t really have enough to like, ball, you know, bruise in and like, smash apart everything.
Griffin: Sure.
Clint:: And I that, and I think that-- I really, it really came home when um, when we created the new characters for the, the, steam universe. That really-- [crosstalk] Then it was fun.
Griffin: [crosstalk] That was fucking great. Yeah.
Clint:: Then I was-- I felt it was a little bit more liberated, it was a little bit more, you know uh, “okay what do you wanna do that’ll be fun”, and I think that’s where we came up with those characters. Um, I have a uh-- [crosstalk]
Travis: Justin what about Taako? I wanna know about Taako’s inception, creation, everything.
Justin: Okay. So, Taako is-- is a character, uh, that I play on The Adventure Zone, who I largely improvised, everything, about Taako.
Clint:: Including the name! [laughs]
Justin: Including his name, as he was, created. Um, and I started doing the voice, for him, um, [clears throat], uh, and like, I don’t know where the voice-- it was basically my friend Michael Beck.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh my god, yeah it is!
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah it is.
Clint:: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, that-- yeah.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah uh it’s just the Michael Beck voice. Um, and so my friend Michael Beck is Taako, or it’s like-- [Laughter]
Justin: his voice is Taako, so basically I stole Michael Beck’s voice for Taako. Um, uh-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: Sorry this is, this is an amazing revelation for me! And I imagine for the audience too that there’s somebody who, exists, and lives in the real, physical world that we all know, who kind of sounds like Taako a bit. [Laughter]
Justin: Yeah, I mean he’s basically like-- he doesn’t like, really act like Taako. But um-- [crosstalk]
Travis: No he’s not really an elf wizard. Wanna make that clear.
Justin: I had wanted to, um, I had wanted to play with Taako’s, like, sexuality? Like not in a way that was like, particularly prominent in the story, but, in my mind, when I was like, doing the character and like, had Taako’s, like, story, in my head, Taako was a-- was a gay guy. And I don’t, I don’t know why, that was just how it always seemed to me. And then when we brought up the-- when we were gonna bring it up in an episode, Griffin made the point that like, “Hey, the-- that backstory combined with the voice you are doing makes it seem like you’re doing like, a stereotypically, effeminate-- [crosstalk] gay character.”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Right.
Justin: Which is, which didn’t occur to me because I was doing-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] You were just doing, you were just thinking, “I’m doing Michael Beck’s fun voice.”
Justin: I’m just doing Michael Beck’s voice-- [Laughter]
Justin: --who is not a gay fella. So I, I did not-- it did not occur to me that like those two combined like, oh, I could see where he was coming from. But like, in, in-- so that is, sort of like, the weird backstory behind Taako. And, and I did, you know, it’s part of why I wanted to play a woman character in, uh, the uh, or not a woman, female. Like not to get too Ferengi, but she’s Thoth so, she’s not a woman. Uh, you know I wanted to-- I like the idea of playing somebody who’s really different from me and has like a different perspective and whatever-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: You do that in video games a lot, too. Like we were playing Division together, and you were playing as a, as a black woman. And like just any-- I feel like any time you get the chance to make a character in a videogame, you usually like, don’t make it look like Justin.
Justin: I just don’t see the point in that like what’s-- [crosstalk] the point.
Travis: [crosstalk] You get to be Justin every day.
Justin: Can I be honest? Uh, a lot of it deals with the fact that in, uh, almost all character creation generators, um, I can’t make an overweight character. And I don’t feel like, if I’m gonna try to represent mys-- if I’m gonna try to recreate myself-- [crosstalk] on the screen, I don’t wanna create like an idealized fake-ass version of myself.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Justin: So I’d rather just like, play a beautiful black woman, who, like, who’s great at shooting guns at people-- [crosstalk] like that sounds amazing too.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah. It’s so funny to hear Justin talk about creating Taako because I spent so much time creating like an intricate backstory--
Clint:: [chuckling]
Travis: [crosstalk] --for Magnus.
Clint:: [crosstalk] You did. You sent the “Magnus Bible” about one week [crosstalk] in.
Travis: I-- it was like, four pages long and Griffin nixed it because I made it way too dramatic.
Griffin: It was extremely dark, like extremely, extremely, extremely-- [crosstalk] like, dark, and serious--
Travis: [crosstalk] But like, that was how much thought I put into the character, and so very little of it [laughter] has ever come up. But like, that was my like, “I know Magnus!” And then, I honestly, once we started playing, kinda felt restricted by it. And people have commented like, “I thought he was supposed to be like, lawful good”, and I was like, “Yeah, but that’s not-- [crosstalk] actually how I wanted to play it.”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Lot of people ask about, a lot of people ask about our um, alignment. Or your guys alignment. It’s like part-- [crosstalk] of the comedy--
Clint:: [crosstalk] [sarcasm] What’s alignment?
Griffin: Yeah, exactly! Like, that’s part of the running commentary, uh, in--in stuff like the-- I feel like the Reddit gets like, way more into like, talking about how we navigate the--the like, rules and ideas of the--of the D&D books, and this idea of like, “Well, I don’t understand like, are they--lawful evil? Like, they’re just murdering people that they didn’t really need to murder, there’s...[ends abruptly]” And it’s like, that-- I don’t, I don’t -- I think that’s a weird thing-- D&D Fifth Edition also introduces, um, this table of characteristics that is like, uh, do you guys know what I’m talking about? It’s like, “flaws”, and [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah-- “backstory”, uh, “flaws”, “beliefs”...
Griffin: uh, but it, it’s supposed to like, summarize your character in these four sentences talking about like, their ideals, their flaws, and then, I don’t-- I don’t understand why you have to put that shit on [crosstalk] your character sheet because it just seems like, h-brandcuffs, you know? {25:36}
Travis: [crosstalk] You know, I-- I just, Griffin, I just assumed that it was like, for people who were like, “I’m not good at creating a person out of nothing”
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: “I need some kind of skeleton to build off,” ‘cause it gives you-- that’s where like, the option of like, “folk hero” came from, y’know? ‘Cause that idea of like, “Oh--” and like, I did it because I like to exercise every option that’s given to me in chara-- so when it’s like, “Do you want a trinket?” I’m like, “Yeah, [unison] fuck yeah I want a trinket!”
Griffin: [unison] “...fuck yeah I want a trinket!” {26:00} Yeah.
Travis: But then like, I start playing and I’m like, “Oh I’m gonna ignore half of this,” [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Well…
Travis: because it’s not interesting to me to be like, “I’m lawful good, so at every [crosstalk] option I have…”
Griffin: [crosstalk] So I have to be good every time I…
Travis: Yeah
Griffin: Yeah
Travis: Yeah, like, that’s not fun.
Justin: Yeah. I think part of it is also the-- I-- I-- it’s to sort of, chain yourself from-- like, keep yourself from doing what you would instinctually do.
Travis: Yeah
Justin: ‘Cause like, my character’s-- like-- like it is not necessarily what I would be doing, you know what I mean? But like-- to have some guideline that you yourself have to be beholden to that-- that this idea that character is something immutable as height or skin color [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] I mean, it’s why I stuck with “Magnus Rushes In” be-- and-- I’m-- I try so hard not to be a puzzle solver/problem solver as Magnus ‘cause that’s what I, Travis McElroy, [crosstalk] love to do...
Griffin: [crosstalk] The-- the-- the characteristics, I feel like, that these characters have-- have developed, um, and Magnus, you’ve had the “Magnus Rushes In” thing for-- uh-- a-- a while now, and I feel like that’s still your sort of defining like… “thoughtless action”, like “total reflexive response” like, that-- that’s been, sort of good-to-go from the beginning, um, like, Merle, I really like how Merle [chuckling] has become like, this weirdly irreverent cleric?
Travis: Yup
Griffin: Like-- when-- when he discovers, like, Boyland’s dead body like, he cracks a joke and that’s the first thing he does, and also he has this weird sexual relationship with plants [crosstalk] like that...
Clint:: I look at myself as a lapsed cleric [crosstalk], so...
Griffin: [crosstalk] M’kay
Travis: [crosstalk] And I love that.
Griffin: And Taako like-- “Taako hangs back, Taako’s good back here,” like, that is-- great, like, you guys have these characteristics that I feel like are really great that wouldn’t fit on a character sheet. {27:34}
Justin: I wanna hear another question from Dad.
Clint:: Okay, this kinda ties in with what we’ve been talking about-- uh, there’s kind of a running thread that runs through a lot of these [chuckling] questions that I think-- that-- outside of, well, I think maybe applying to you and me, Juice, that-- that-- feel like we have had a lot more [chuckling] thought going into this than we have, “Is Taako…”, this comes from Jeff, Jett, I’m sorry, “Is Taako eventually discovering the recipe for tacos somehow the key to defeating a really really big-ass boss, whoever he or she may be? And if so can this really really big-ass boss be a representative of some [laughing] sort of rival food style such as Italian or American cuisine?”
Justin: Okay, can we…
Griffin: Can we ta-- alright…
Justin: The taco thing.
Griffin: [unison] The taco thing.
Justin: [unison] The taco thing.
Clint:: Let’s talk about the taco thing.
Justin: Okay, the taco thing.
Griffin: Okay, let’s-- let’s dive into fuckin’ Tacogate, cause Justin-- [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Okay….
Griffin: I didn’t-- I edit the show, it is, uh, the most intensive edit-- between both the audio and the video shit I do -
Clint:: [laughing]
Griffin: - like, I-- when I edit Monster Factory that is a half-hour production cut down from usually, like two and a half hours of video, and like, everything that goes into video editing-- The Adventure Zone is still a rougher edit than that?
Clint:: [chuckling]
Griffin: Um, just because there’s a lot of-- let’s call them optimization points, and not “Whoopsie daisies” and “Uh-ohs” and long pauses while we look up rules and shit. Uh, but there’s also a lot of overtalk we do on the show ‘cause there’s fuckin’ four of us, which is a gaggle-- of people, and during the Hodge Podge bit-- I think we actually got a bunch of questions about this for The The Adventure Zone Zone too so let’s address it now-- uh, Justin asked about tacos, Taako asked about tacos, uh, and the reason that we didn’t respond, isn’t because-- like, tacos don’t exist in the world-- I mean, to-- to open things up a bit, if I introduced this planar system that our real world is a part of, like, they do exist in our world, right? I can go eat a real taco whenever I want...so they do exist-- [crosstalk] that’s not the issue here…
Travis: [crosstalk] Oh, lah-dee-dah… [laughter]
Griffin: I’m just saying, well, I live in Austin… [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] You couldn’t right now, could you tough guy?
Clint:: Go ahead, go get a taco, [crosstalk] yeah!
Justin: [crosstalk] You think you’re so big, [crosstalk] eating tacos whenever you want!
Griffin: [crosstalk] I-- I-- I fuckin’-- I live in Austin; I could open up the window of my office right now and stick my head out and open my mouth and I’d probably catch a taco in it.
Clint:: They deliver tacos to your door like the milkman there.
Griffin: So, the reason I-- the reason I cut that out isn’t for any narrative purposes; it was literally because Dad and Travis also both asked a question at the same fuckin’ time,
Clint:: [laughter]
Griffin: and-- like Justin encircled back to it and Travis’ question was the more pertinent like, relati-- relevant like, puzzle-solving… {30:01}
Justin: And I don’t think I asked him about tacos, it was somethin’...
Travis: I think it was like, ground beef [crosstalk] or hard shells...
Clint:: [crosstalk] It was cows, wasn’t it?
Griffin: Yeah [general crosstalk] (no, yeah, somethin’, etc) {30:09}
Justin: [crosstalk] No...
Griffin: Uh, yeah, um [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] No, it was-- the thing about the taco thing was it was a dumbass fucking dumb, dumb joke that it-- that I-- that I came up with like in-- on-- in the moment? And I think, uh, a few problems with returning to that particular thread are; One: I don’t remember which ones I have, [crosstalk] Two:...
Griffin: [crosstalk] You have sour cre-- you got sour cream, you have the concept of grinding, um, [crosstalk]
Clint:: [crosstalk] There’s cheese!
Griffin: I think, you have the word cheese but you don’t understand what it means, and, uh,
Clint:: [laughter]
Griffin: A lot of people, this might be news to a lot of people who haven’t listened to, uh, the LA liveshow, which is a, uh, bonus episode, uh that you can get if you are a Maximum Fun donor, at at least the five dollar level, uh, [crosstalk] shells.
Justin: [crosstalk] maximumfun.org/donate
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, shells.
Griffin: Yeah, shells. Cause you [crosstalk] destroyed a-- a turtle, uh, with a fireball, and you got hot meat in a shell.
Justin: So it’s like… pretty close…
Griffin: You’re getting pretty close, actually. [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] I mean, pretty close, I...
Clint:: [crosstalk] Yeah, but you know what, it has turned into somethin’, we don’t want to abandon it! [crosstalk] no…
Justin: The-- the thing is, if we had-- okay so this is the really hard thing about this. The Adventure Zone is-- is a, sort of, a collaborative story-telling...
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: - show, in part; it’s also though, a story that Griffin has composed, right?
Griffin: Right.
Justin: Griffin does know the structure of this. So like, things like this, if we were to ever have some like, big payoff for the taco thing; it would have to be something that Griffin and I came up with, [unison] together…
Griffin: [unison] Together without-- without talking about it, ‘cause I can’t reveal that [crosstalk] to you.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah. Yeah like-- it would have to be something Griffin and I somehow like, simpatico, or, Griffin like, open the door for me to do [crosstalk] and like-- like inevitably missed it.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Right.
Griffin: Which is something like, I-- I feel like conceptually we have kind of butted heads on this, not with that like us-- any of us like actively, y’know fighting about it, but it is-- it is really-- I want you guys to be a part of shaping this story, I really do and there have been times where like, your decisions have changed things both on the like, micro-arc-to-arc and the macro like whole-campaign scale:
It’s really fucking hard, guys, ‘cause it’s like-- just writing the thing is hard, right, and coming up with an idea is really, really hard. I think it’s uh, I’ve never written fiction before, in my life, I think this is the-- probably the most interesting way to start it? Because you’re not just writing a story; you’re writing a story where the fucking characters in your story, are, at times, fighting against the ends that you are trying to design [crosstalk] it’s...
Travis: [crosstalk] And there’s an even deeper layer than that, Griffin, where the characters are created to wanna do stuff and the players know stuff that the characters don’t, so like, I would do something but Magnus would do something different because of the character I’ve created...
Griffin: Right.
Travis: You know what I mean? So you have to deal with both me and the character.
Griffin: It’s like J.K. Rowling writing Harry Potter, but then like, Hermione was like “You know what? I don’t go in that door.” It’s like, “Well fuck, okay, well shit there was some dope stuff behind that door, guess I gotta write another thing…” Like, that-- that’s what we’re dealing with, so like, the taco thing, I-- I-- I-- I have-- it is a part of my plan on a long-form thing, I want-- I don’t want you to give up on it, it’s just like, it’s-- it’s hard incorporating that stuff fluidly into the-- the stuff that I have-- have also prepared. {33:28}
Travis: Alright. Let’s get another question.
Clint:: Alright, let’s do nuts and bolts a little bit. Quick question for Travis, this is from Jesse, thank you Jesse for taking time out from all of your many podcasts. Quick question for Travis, “Have you considered buying more types of weapons? When you come up against a creature resistant to, say, slashing, you could drop the ax, and equip a warhammer, or spear.”, Jesse asks.
Travis: Um…
Clint:: We don’t buy a lot… well I guess in the Fantasy Costco, right?
Travis: Yeah, we could, um, you know? I-- I’ll say this; it’s one of those things where, up till now, we’ve been moving forward pretty well, like I-- I know-- I like to joke about the fact that I don’t have any magical spells; in Fourth Edition, they gave like, fighters...
Griffin: [crosstalk] Every-- everyone was a wizard in Fourth Edition, like everybody had spells and powers.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, you had the equivalent of like, magic fighting spells...
Griffin: Right
Travis: - all the time. And-- I don’t usually play a fighter, like in anything [crosstalk] I’m almost always a rogue.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Usually a rogue. Yeah
Travis: Yeah. Almost always a rogue. So, I’m never really that bothered by like, “Oh I tried to cut it with my ax and he’s resistant to like, hacking damage,” um, because then it’s just, that’s the-- that’s the twist. Also it’s important to note that I’ve never felt like Griffin was playing against me as DM when it was like, “Okay, your ax doesn’t do anyth…”. It’s not like, petty, it’s not like, [crosstalk] “Your ax doesn’t do anything.”
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, what I-- what I appreciate, and what I actually really love about Fifth Edition is: the class isn’t called “Warrior”, it’s not called fuckin’ “Strongman”... it’s called “Fighter”...
Travis: Yeah
Griffin:..and what’s great about that is, Yeah, They’re the best at fighting, and that’s not the like-- in-- in Fourth Edition, to go back to that, like, anybody could do like, a bunch of damage in combat. By the time that the fighter reaches like, I think it was like 14th level? They get to do three attacks in a single turn. They’re wicked-fuckin’ good at fighting. And I like that, like not [crosstalk] a...
Travis: [crosstalk] Not at special fighting skills….
Griffin: Right. Travis… that are like, “Okay now you do something, [crosstalk] and come with me!”
Griffin: [crosstalk] But okay-- what I think is-- what I think is interesting is I think, uh, a lot of RPGs are, like, everybody can do anything in combat. Everybody-- which I always thought was kinda sellin’ short shrift to the like, fighting classes of like, “Well they should be the best at fighting,” and what I like about Fifth Edition is like, un-- unarguably, the Fighter’s the best at fighting.
They don’t have as much utility like, outside of combat, and I think Fifth Edition kind of shines outside of combat a lot of the time, but if you get into a fight, like, the fighter is gonna lead shit and be really really good at fighting. Um, in terms of the other weapons stuff, like, I guess part of that is on me, although like, I feel like Railsplitter is so iconic now, like-- like [crosstalk] you look at any piece of fanart with Magnus in it…
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, and also, the thing is is like, I-- it’s-- it’s kind of nice compared to Fourth Edition ‘cause in Fourth Edition there were so many options that you could do as a fighter that like, I felt like it kind of bogged stuff down a lot of the time.
Griffin: Fights took so fuckin’ long in Fourth Edition.
Travis: Because you had to worry about like, “Well, when do I use my Daily, when do I use [crosstalk] my Encounter Power? Oh, should I use it against this person? What does it inc…” And now it’s just like, “Okay, I’m gonna tackle that dude and try to punch him in the face.”
Griffin:[crosstalk] Right. And also because Fourth Edition was kind of designed to be played on a board like a board game-- movement was a huge thing…
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin:...like, there were powers-- there were lots of powers based around like, slowing enemies’ movement, or increasing your own movement, or-- or freezing them in place, so that they couldn’t be in the-- the proper posi-- I don’t worry about movement-- it was the thing I struggled the most with, in like, trying to figure out how we would do this show remotely-- We don’t even like, screenshare a-- a game board, although there are some really cool tools to use that do stuff like that, like Roll20, and um, Tabletop Simulator-- there’s like some really cool stuff, although I doubt that we could like, [crosstalk] work that into our workflow, which is like…
Clint:: [crosstalk] We-- we don’t even keep out character sheets up to date, Ditto! [laughter]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Right, it’s pretty fuckin’ hard....
Travis: [crosstalk] Some of us do!
Griffin: [crosstalk] Well actually, I mean, what would be great is that those systems actually do that stuff for you. But, I-- I think it would be tricky for us to like, gather around computer software and do the stuff that we’re doing normally, um, but I also like how we don’t get bogged down in stuff like position and movement and all that-- all that jazz, um….
Clint:: Which, again, that-- that harkens back to: It’s great when you’re playing in person, you’re playing with each other...
Travis: Yeah.
Clint:: That is-- that is kind of awesome. ‘Cause then you’re seeing it all,
Griffin: Right.
Clint:: We’re working through an audial, uh, medium, and so it, we-- we, and we need to keep it movin’ so...
Travis: Yeah, and it--
Clint:: Which is one of the reasons I get asked all the time why we don’t go to the store, and why we don’t have to stop and eat, and why we don’t stop and get [crosstalk] water...
Griffin: [crosstalk] Well that’s just like, that’s-- that’s like, we talked about that episode one. There’s so much stuff, we-- we got a question about that to like, “I noticed that you guys don’t follow like, a lot of the, uh, a lot of the rules in the book.” and it’s specifically stuff around like, “ammunition”, stuff like um, there are [crosstalk] mostly…
Justin: [crosstalk] Spell components.
Griffin: Spell components! Right, there-- there are ritual spells, um, that you can cast by using spell components, which, we need to talk about this, boys, ‘cause it might actually change the game for you two, um, You can cast rituals using those components without having to burn a spell slot. {38:04}
Clint:: [“eh” noise]
Griffin: Hey that’s-- that’s good to know.
Clint:: [sarcasm] What’s a spell slot?
Griffin: Exactly, like, there’s so much stuff that we don’t do because, I think, in terms of it being, like, a resource-management game, I think it could be interesting - you have to survive this harsh world, so instead of just, like, getting you straight to the dungeon by shooting you there literally out of a fuckin’ story cannon, you have to, like, walk there. And along the way you gotta forage for berries. Like, I can see how that could be cool, but -
Travis: But all of that is fun as, like, an immersive, group of people getting together once a week in, like, your living room.
Clint:: Right.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: I don’t know that it would be super interesting - especially since one of the things that I have liked most about The Adventure Zone is, we’ve seen a lot of people say “I’ve never played before”, or “I’ve never had an interest in Dungeons & Dragons, and then I started listening to your show, and it’s kinda made me wanna play it”, because I think we don’t so much worry about the mechanics - like, I get asked constantly, about, like, rolling, and about my seeming ability to roll really well -
Griffin: [crosstalk] We have a question we can address right now, of how many times you fudge your numbers. {39:00}
Justin: Dad, can you find the question about fudging numbers?
Clint:: Um, the question about fudging numbers…[crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] Is that in the list?
Clint:: Oh, yeah, yeah, um, I think...oh, like, [crosstalk] how much the dice--about the dice?
Justin: Oh, actually, you know what? We should stop and do a, uh, let’s talk about about the pledge drive --
Travis: Okay, teaser: you’re gonna hear about me fudging numbers right after this break. [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, we’re gonna get to, we’re gonna get to that--
Justin: We’ll talk about that - [crosstalk] right after the break. {technical ad break ~39:40}
Griffin: We’re gonna get to Travis’s 20-sided die that has eighteen 18’s on it here in a minute, but, um, before that, let’s talk about, what does being on the Max Fun network mean? For us, like, we started- we joined the network in 2011, they, uh, picked us up after what like, 30 episodes [crosstalk] of My Brother, My Brother, and Me?
Travis: [crosstalk] Mm-hmm.
Griffin: It was very- [laughs] they got in on the ground floor!
Justin: The bad floor!
Griffin: Huh? The bad, shaky, rotten floor. Uh, and because of the support we’ve gotten from the network and from, uh, the listeners who donate every MaxFunDrive - which we only do once a year, runs for two weeks - we’ve been able to do things like live shows! We’ve done like, fuckin, like 25 live shows for My Brother, My Brother, And Me, we did our first live Adventure Zone last year, we’ve launched other podcasts like The Adventure Zone, like Sawbones, like Bunker Buddies, like Shmanners. We’re able to dedicate more time and resources to it because of the support that we get from you all, and if we weren't a part of this network we’d probably still be doing fuckin’ My Brother, My Brother, and Me just with Rock Band microphones! [crosstalk]
Travis: And no joke, it- like, over the five years of being at Max Fun, this is my full time job because of listeners and donors and supporters like you, and it - [crosstalk]
Justin: But Travis is poor, and he has to fix- [crosstalk]
Clint:: [crosstalk] He has a horrible, horrible lifestyle.
Justin: He has a horrible lifestyle.
Travis: I live in a box here in Los Angeles. But it’s a super nice box, don’t get me wrong.
Justin: Yeah, fourteen hundred dollars a month, it should be!
Travis: Yeah! That’s actually underselling the price, but thank you.
Justin: That’s a LA rent joke.
Travis: But yeah, it’s like, it’s an amazing-- and it’s not only great for the support, and the ability that we’ve had to be able to grow the shows financially, but also just, the listener community of Max Fun is intensely supportive and wonderful and like [crosstalk]--
Griffin: It’s the - it’s the best in the world. Like, Justin and I both work in the video game, uh, industry, which has some, uh, let’s call it...Troublesome... Sects...inside of it, uh, and that just doesn’t exist here cause it’s the - it’s the - just across the board it is the coolest community of people ever.
Clint:: Was that S-E-X?
Travis: Yup.
Griffin: Yeah, it has some bad - there are bad sex in the - no.
Clint:: As your father I want you to immediately leave.
Travis: So, here is the thing- [crosstalk]
Griffin: That’s such a weird punishment, Dad!
Clint:: [chuckling]
Travis: If you are a fan of our shows, um, Adventure Zone and everything else on the network, you could become a donor for as low as five dollars a month, which is - it’s a really good entry point, I think, because five dollars a month to me is like, one nice cup of like, cappuccino or something, at a fancy coffee shop.
Griffin: And for joining at that level you get what I think is the absolute best reward, which is - hundreds of, uh, maybe not hundreds, dozens and dozens and dozens of episodes of all of the podcasts at Maximum Fun, including three bonus Adventure Zone episodes. Uh, the one that Travis led, we did have the LA Live Show, where the boys have a beach vacation kind of, and then the uh, prequel episode, which I don’t know that we’ve ever talked about, where you guys uh, first meet.
Justin: Well of course like, Dad and I like, remembered all of it, it’s part of our-
Clint:: Yeah. Oh yeah.
Travis: It’s not canon--
Griffin: Well, that is where we learn about Taako’s backstory, of being a traveling chef entertainer who accidentally poisoned a whole town.
Travis: Oh yeah!
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: Do you remember that? That’s like, my favorite Taako backstory thing like ever.
Justin: I don’t - I mean, uh, this is gonna sound like I’m fucking with you but I - I do, that’s a big part of why Taako is the way he is, like he is kind of a self preservationist at this point. [crosstalk]
Griffin: We do try to keep the - like the LA Podfest, like I don’t think there’s much overarching character development stuff that happens in that one? Um, [all at once]
Clint:: But there was cool stuff!
Travis: There were giant crows, though.
Justin: There was cool stuff, yeah. [/all at once]
Griffin: Yeah, there was cool stuff in it, but I tried to keep the story stuff out of it as much as we can, I think that prequel episode - there’s some interesting character development, like, background stuff, stuff that is maybe not as germane to the whole arc, because it takes place like way before it, but um, some interesting stuff about your guys’s characters.
Travis: And you can get that for as low as $5 a month, get access to all of that. And remember, our goal is 5,000 new and upgrading donors. If Max Fun hits that, it’ll be awesome, and if we - if Max Fun hits it, we’re gonna try to release more of The Adventure Zone: (K)nights episodes.
Justin: Now, we talked about $20 a month, Dad, can you tell them about -
Clint:: What about $10 a month?
Justin: Well, $10 a month, yeah.
Clint:: $10 a month, you can get the Max Fun bananas. These are -
Griffin: Nope! No Daddy, no Daddy, no Daddy. [crosstalk] No, Daddy. [crosstalk, indistinct]
Justin: [crosstalk] Bananas?
Griffin: No, Daddy.
Clint:: Oh! Yeah. Bandanas.
Justin: Very good. [crosstalk, indistinct]
Clint:: Like the, yeah, Max Fun Bandanas, 22 to - I knew. [crosstalk] I was joking.
Travis: [crosstalk] I know. This is another behind the scenes thing, sometimes Dad pretends to be dumb but he’s not [crosstalk]
Griffin: Welcome to The The Dad Joke Zone Zone.
Justin: Either Dad thought that was funny, or he thought that said “bananas”, both are equally troubling.
Clint:: Is it not funny? Uh, all the art by Megan Lynn Kott, so it is really really cool. And you get to pick the show you want, so I guess we know which one you’re going to pick--
Griffin: Judge John Hodgman!
Justin: Yeah.
Clint:: Up to 20, uh--
Justin: We talked about 20, let’s talk about 35.
Clint:: Okay, 35, alright. 35 - ah, this is pretty cool. This is a travel tumbler. It’s a vacuum thermos, and when you go with $35 a month, that Max Fun thermos is there for you to drink your frosty beverages, -
Griffin: Or your hot beverages! It’s got a rocket - [crosstalk]
Clint:: Your hot toddies.
Travis: Or your adult beverages.
Clint:: Or your adult beverages -
Griffin: It has a rocket ship on it, which as you all know, makes the fluid inside taste way better.
Clint:: Yeah, and it has fire come out of the bottom for the hot beverages and is going into the cold vacuum of space, so it takes care of your cold beverages too.
Travis: Exactly.
Justin: Dad -
Travis: And it’s important to note that every you donate at, you get everything below it, so at 35 you get the thermos, you get the adventure kit, you get the bandana, and all the bonus content.
Griffin: Yes. More importantly, the like, you- you - well, I don’t know, I can’t rank your priorities, but like, you also support us, and just feel a sense of ownership over this thing! Like, we are all donors to the Maximum Fun network - which is like, silly if you think about it, cause like, we also, y’know, get the money you guys donate to us, so we’re weirdly donating to ourselves?
I try not to think about it. But we do donate to the Maximum Fun Network because like, we think what is happening at the Maximum Fun Network is radical. Um, I listen to like three or four Maximum Fun podcasts because I think they’re great, and I think the ethos of the network is really terrific. So you can, um, become a part of that, become a supporter, feel some ownership over, over the network too. Just go to maximumfun.org/donate, you can find out all the details and stuff there.
{technical ad break ends ~45:49}
Travis: So. Here’s the thing -
Justin: Wait, I wanna hear the question, what’s the official question. First.
Griffin: Why is Travis such a liar.
Clint:: Okay, here’s a question, this comes from Clay - “How much of the dice rolling gets edited out? The pace of the podcast makes D&D seem fun, not a bunch of cumbersome rules and rolling like I remember” which we addressed a few minutes ago, but I think this might be a nice way to segue into Travis’s skills at dice rolling!
Travis: Okay. So here’s the thing.
Griffin: Travis is great at rolling di-- he’s just really good - [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, okay -
Griffin: Since he was a child, he’s just been rolling them bones, just like, 6, that’s a 6, that’s a 6, that’s a 6, I’m awesome.
Travis: Hear me out. One, one of the keys - it - we always joke about being really good at D&D but one of the keys is know the strengths of your characters, what are you like trained in, what are you proficient in, and then do that and it’s a lot easier to have successful rolls. Two, as a fighter in fifth edition, you get like, plus seven bonus -
Griffin: Travis is what we like to call, min-maxed, uh, in D&D terms, which means that he is very, very, very good at a few things, and very, very, very bad at a lot things.
Travis: Yeah, I don’t do a lot of Intelligence checks.
Griffin: Right, like, I haven’t really introduced many like, psychic characters, who can like, fuckin mind flayers who can get deep in that dome and make you do things you don’t wanna do. [crosstalk]
Travis: They would destroy Magnus.
Griffin: If I did that to Magnus, that would be a guaranteed death, like, a hundred percent like, that’s - . So there’s things like - I feel like your Charisma’s probably not great, Intelligence probably isn’t great, Wisdom’s not probably great, - I don’t mean to slam you right now.
Travis: No, no you’re right, like, I’ve poured a lot into Dexterity, into Strength, and into Constitution, but like my Wisdom and Intelligence are like, super duper low. [crosstalk]
Griffin: So, a lot of that -
Travis: So that’s two, and then three: I will say that maybe one in thirty, I will fudge slightly, but only on-- [crosstalk] -
Griffin: You’re fired. You are banned, you’re banned from the game. Cheater. This whole thing was a sting operation, Cheats McGeets, there’s the door, take your dice with you!
Travis: Only on - Only on skill checks, and only so we - we don’t have to like, keep trying, cause like, okay, we need to like jump over a pit. Like, it’s clearly what we need to do, and we only have an hour to like, tell a story. It’s not interesting to listen to me like, attempt to jump over a pit six times.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Cheats. McGeets.
Travis: You know what I mean. That’s - I will say that that is the one and only time, like if I’m off by like one, I’ll say like, fifteen instead of fourteen.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Do you hear. Do you hear the sirens outside your door.
Clint:: And if I can, if I can part the burrito just a little bit, to point out something. Point number four: of the three of us rolling, Justin and I are together for this recording, so we have witnesses. We can keep each other honest. [crosstalk] And Travis is by himself.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah but also like- it’s not like I’m winning a gold medal, it’s not like I’m - what’s the point, like I’m not trying to cheat to win D&D.
Clint:: Travis…
Griffin: [crosstalk] The thing that I wish we could do-
Clint:: I watched you grow up, I played Clue with you -
Travis: I played Clue with you too! One-round old man!
Griffin: Yeah. This guy - [crosstalk]
Travis: How did you do it?
Clint:: [cackling]
Griffin: This guy. This fucking dude.
Travis: How did you fucking do it, Clinton. It eats away at me.
Griffin: We were on vacation, in a hotel somewhere, I forget where we were, and we played Clue, and Dad got it first round. I don’t know how - I mean cheating, probably, but -
Clint:: I didn’t cheat!
Travis: I learned it from watching you, Dad!
Justin: Don’t accuse Dad of cheating - [crosstalk]
Clint:: I am the patriarch.
Justin: I’ll fuckin re-roll every once in a while, this is a comedy podcast we’re doing, folks, not the fuckin Olympics.
Griffin: [laughs]
Justin: Like, it’s a comedy podcast, I’m not juicing, I’m trying to keep the good fun flowin’ for you.
Griffin: The one thing I wish we could do, the one thing that would be great about like, playing in a virtual environment -
Justin: I don’t make up rolls, by the way, whole-cloth.
Griffin: Huh?
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: I don’t make up rolls whole-cloth, it’s just like, if something is about to happen that would be particularly funny, like, I’ll sneak another roll in, to see if we can make it happen, cause that would be better to listen to, than like-
Clint:: We can do that?
Justin: “And then you don’t.”
Clint:: We can do that?
Justin: Dad, I have like literally lied about your rolls to the microphone for you, because you couldn’t figure out what - [crosstalk]
Griffin: Wow, so this is just like, rampant then. [crosstalk] This is just rampant juicing.
Justin: No-
Travis: I said, one in thirty-
Clint:: But- my rolls are so shitty!
Justin: Dad’s rolls are really shitty.
Griffin: Yeah, he’s very bad. Um, so, the thing that I think would be great, if we could use - I wish there was a version of like, Roll20 or Desktop-- uh, uh, what’s it called, Tabletop Simulator, where I wouldn’t want the game board and all that shit, I would just want us to have a shared environment where we could see each other’s dice rolls. And it’s not like, just because I, y’know, would want to fact-check you guys, it’s because I think there’s an inherent hilarity and an inherent sort of excitement that comes from everybody seeing the dice that you roll. Right, -
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I agree.
Griffin: --Like, it’s like that craps mentality of like, really high stakes, and then when you see a, like Travis is doing a desperate last-ditch attack and rolls a 20, like a nat 20, like that’s thrilling and exciting, and we miss out on that just from Travis saying, “Uh that’s a nat 20”. Or from Dad saying like “Oh, that’s a critical failure.” Like, if Dad rolls a critical failure in an intense situation, that’s funny most of the time and we miss out on that. [crosstalk]
Travis: And not surprising.
Griffin: And not surprising-
Justin: And I would never fib about that kind of thing, like -
Travis: Me neither.
Griffin: And I’m not talking about that -
Justin: I don’t mean fib, more like a re-roll every once in a while - if I get a one, I’m gonna get my ass handed to me, like - I’ll handle that, sounds great.
Griffin: I’m less talking about fact-checking, I’m more talking about there is an excitement to this game from watching other people do what they do. And we don’t get that here, -
Justin: [yawning] You see, I actually disagree with you on this point, Griffin, because I think that if we could all see the dice rolls, we would be about fifty-fifty on whether we said what the roll was out loud, if we remembered to actually do that. The- if- I think by and large we would just forget and be like “Oh shit, I can’t believe it!” and then move on and like, forget to say what the roll was.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Clint:: I-- then let me be perfectly honest--
Travis: How much did we edit out-
Justin: Wait Trav, hold on.
Clint:: Let me be perfectly honest, I have lied about most of my rolls ‘cause they’re usually really really good.
Travis: Okay.
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: [laughing]
Clint:: I lie about them being bad just for the comedy.
Justin: Yeah, just keep it coming, funny.
Clint:: Perfect 20, perfect 20, perfect 20.
Justin: [crosstalk] Uh, nat 20, yeah.
Griffin: To answer like, how much of the game process I edit out - uhhhhh...I? Uh, a fair amount, like I don’t edit out like, when you guys do- you guys so rarely- how many fuckin perception checks have you guys done? Like when I play D&D I’m just- you heard it in the bonus episode, every time I walked into a room I’m like “Perception check, I’m not gonna walk into a fuckin bear trap, Perception check, Perception che-”
Clint:: [crosstalk] Well but- but--
Griffin: Like you guys don’t execute the game rules very often, so when you do, [smiling] those precious few times when you do, I don’t - I typically don’t edit them out wholesale. All- I will edit out like rule checkups and math breaks - which are humiliating -
Travis: [crosstalk] and Dad spilling Coke Zero--
Griffin: --Dad spilling - oh, well no, I left that in the show, cause he needed to be taught a lesson.
Justin: Heh.
Clint:: Well- that’s- that’s an excellent point. Alright, I got another question. And this is one that - that we get asked a lot. {52:37} This comes from Andrew - actually a - yeah, Andrew, who said: “When can we expect a Barry Bluejeans themed dungeon explaining his dark and mysterious past? It could aptly be named ‘Barry Bluejeans: Origins’” - you’ve really thought about this, Andrew - “or ‘Barry Bluejeans: Awakening.’ [crosstalk]” Barry Bluejeans is one of the characters that has kind of caught on.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I- Why?
Travis: He was in the show for about 35 seconds!
Griffin: He was in the show for about as long as Yeemick - the gob - gerblin usurper - was, and nobody’s- nobody’s fuckin throwing parades for old Yeemick! Everybody’s crazy for Barry Bluejeans! Which I get, uh-
Travis: I think Barry Bluejeans, for me, represents the moment where we kind of all collectively broke from D&D proper-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: That’s a good point, yeah!
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: --where you were, like, naming these [crosstalk] like, weird, fake characters.
Griffin: His name was like Sil - Sildar - Sildar Hallwinter.
Travis: And you were like, you know what, I’m just calling him whatever the fuck I want. How about Barry Bluejeans.
Griffin: Can I… can I tell you guys where the - do you guys know the origins of the name Barry Bluejeans?
Justin: I know what it is.
Clint:: I have an idea… is it from Michael Ian Black and The State?
Griffin: No, no, no.
Justin: It’s from Viva Variety.
Griffin: Huh?
Justin: Viva Variety.
Clint:: Yeah, but he also played the same character on The State.
Justin: Oh, was he on The State, too?
Griffin: Uh, no that’s not where he’s from. That’s not where the name is from.
Justin: Really? I always assumed it was Johnny Blue Jeans.
Clint:: I did, too!
Griffin: No. Uh, it is from, uh, there is - I got… I’m gonna have trouble remembering these circumstances. There is a public library in Barboursville that our good friends the Minskers - I believe Chuck did a video thing to sort of promote the library and it was sort of a mystery that took place in the library--
Clint:: Oh my God!
Griffin: --do you remember that, Dad?
Clint:: Yes! I do!
Griffin: And it, it featured many of my friends from the theater we were doing, including my best bud Evan Minsker who [laughs] played a character I believe was the janitor at the library, who he named Barry Bluejeans, which I thought was the funniest thing I’d ever heard in my entire life.
Clint:: [laughs] See, folks, we don’t plan this out.
Travis: Yeah, we didn’t know.
Clint:: I had no idea… I never knew where that came from. I really thought you were going with the Michael Ian Black character.
Griffin: And then, every time I play, like an MMORPG to like preview at events like E3 and PAX and GBC and it’s being led by one of the developers or representatives… I guess, to antagonize them, when I make a character for those lead demonstrations, 100% of the times I name that character Barry Bluejeans, just to let them know, like I’ll take your g- I’ll write about your game, but I don’t have to take this seriously.
Clint:: [laugh]
Griffin: So, yes, that is the origin of the name Barry Bluejeans. And I guess, I think you’re right Travis… I think that’s probably why people like it.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Like, why he is cemented, is because that was the point in the game where, like, okay this is how seriously we’re gonna take this.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: But, yeah, RIP Barry Bluejeans.
Clint:: But that doesn’t answer the question. Would we ever bring him back?
Griffin: He’s dead as fuck. Like, I don’t know how many times I have to say it.
Travis: He’s super dead.
Griffin: Barry Bluejeans… soul has left his body. He is no longer… he is gone. He’s gonzo. He’s dead.
Clint:: So as long as you’re DM’ing, he’s gone.
Griffin: As long as we’re talking about the classic days. I have written out. I don’t if you guys actually think this would be good radio or not. But I spent this morning writing out basically a full run down… a full recap of the show so far.
Clint:: Holy moly.
Travis: Okay, do it.
Justin: Can we close with that? Is that our closer?
Griffin: We can close with that… I don’t, I don’t know if people will be interested in hearing that, I figure like it may be-
Justin: Well, that way, if we close with it, then we give them like… they can just skip it, you know.
Griffin: Yeah, that’s a good point. But, yeah, we’ll save it for the end of the show. But I have a full recap here that I wrote down.
Clint:: So here are some fan questions, let me throw this one out: ‘Holy shit, is the voidfish the eater of everything’?
Griffin: No.
Clint:: [pause] Okay.
Griffin: [crosstalk, unintelligible] I wanted to get ahead of that, like, I don’t wanna drop any big spoilerinos here, but I feel like one of the problems is I have these micro-arcs, right? Like, The Murder on the Rockport Limited, that was a micro- that was an arc. That was one part of the storyline, and there’s stuff that happens in there that affects the broader campaign. And I feel like, maybe this is storytelling fault, but just like looking at some of the theories that are boiling up on Twitter and on Reddit, a lot of people are, like, kinda confusing the two, and I think there’s- yeah, it’s not - that’s not - that is not that.
Clint:: Okay. I love this one. ‘Do you have any tips on creating items for the Fantasy Costco? How should I walk the line between truly useful and overpowered? When the show first came out, Griffin talked about user submitted quests and dungeons, has that idea been phased out?’ No, at least not when it came to the items.
Griffin: The items, definitely. The dungeons and quests, I just can’t, like I just can’t fold stuff like that--
Travis: It’s just so hard to work those into the story arc.
Griffin: Yeah, unless, I had an idea for like - how we could do that as like one off stuff, but I don’t … I don’t… yeah, I don’t know. The items though, like, just don’t send anything like a sword that does a billion damage, or don’t send in something that’s like - I mean - if you wanna send it in as a goof, I’ll read it and laugh… Things that are like referentials like My Brother, My Brother & Me jokes, and stuff like that… I like that. I like reading that stuff, but it’s just not gonna make it in the show, because the items that I like are the items that provide interesting utility.
Travis: Especially, the ones that I like the most and the ones I’m most likely to buy are the ones that seemed very geared towards how we play our charac- so, like Phantom Fist, is a great example of like.. Yeah, that’s something that Magnus would own.
Griffin: But, I like the things that provide utility outside of the normal, sort of, loops of the game… stuff like, probably my favorite item that’s ever been submitted is the pocket spa. I love this idea of just like - from a storytelling perspective, but also from a mechanical perspective - you have a private - you have a secret room. I think that came out of, there’s an item called the mobile fortress, or something like that. And it’s a literal fortress that you press a button on it and it folds up into like the size of a credit card that you can put in your pocket.
Clint:: My favorite’s been- my favorite’s been Nitpicker. {58:19}
Griffin: [crosstalk] Nitpicker’s really great.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah Nitpicker’s pretty good.
Griffin: I mean the shield of memories is also like-- [crosstalk] fucking incredible.
Travis: The shield of memories is so great because one, incredibly well-detailed and creative; two, it’s something that I really needed, you know?
Griffin: Yeah. Um--
Justin: Yeah I think- I think somethin’ that has a cool gameplay construction is probably more valuable than like a joke.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: But just remember that like, the thing about Nitpicker and the thing about the shield, they’re elegant ideas that can be expressed really simply. And I think that that’s the, like that’s kinda the hook for those that makes those work so well.
Griffin: Do you guys- I feel like you guys forget a lot of the time, all the stuff that you have.
Clint:: [laughs]
Griffin: Um, I feel- I feel- well no I’m being- I’m being serious here because like, um, when Justin busted out the Rod of Switcheroo, the Wa- the Wand of Switcheroo to win the race--
Justin: Yeah.
Griffin: --at the end of Petals to the Metal, I was like, I can’t, like I was in disbelief that you remembered that you had that. Um, and you have like The Immovable Rod that you bought in the last one, which I think has all kinds of cool implications. Like, do you get- do you guys actually keep track of that stuff?
Justin: Oh I st- I did forget about that one. [laughs]
Griffin: Yeah see that’s, heh.
Travis: I- I do- I have- I, very detailed notes and character sheets and stuff, but, it also just comes down to like, I’ll have a really funny idea- like, for example, I have the- the Tankard, the one that like makes booze super strong--
Griffin: Yeah yeah.
Travis: --and like that just hasn’t organically come up--
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: --like I don’t know when I would use that. Or like the Lens of Straight Creepin’, that let’s me like see where people have gone, but like--
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: --that just hasn’t organically come up yet. But, I’ve got it so that like, when something happens, i can be like, “Oh this is the perfect time to use this”.
Justin: And as long as we’re like, talkin’ about it, like, I- I - I think part of the, um, part of the reason that the wand occurred in tha- in that particular sequence, and one of the reasons I liked that arc so much, is that I feel like by the nature of our show, there are sections of it, and sometimes like...parts of arcs that don’t seem like, th- that we don’t seem to have a lot of agency.
Griffin: Yeah sure.
Justin: And like- and I think that like--
Griffin: This last- this last episode- like we talked about this, but- after we were done recording, but there are some episodes that are just like…[sighs]. They are extremely narrative-heavy. Like extremely narrative-heavy. This last episode unfurls some shit that is going to affect, uh, it sort of sets the tone for this arc, yeah, but it also like sets the stage for literally the rest of the campaign through the end of this- this storyline. And it’s stuff that like I just kinda had to get out there, and it’s real- again, we talk about butting heads, like it’s really tricky to also give you guys agency in situations like that.
Travis: Can I- can I say my favorite moment out of The Adventure Zone so far? Out of playing it? I loved Petals to the Metal. I loved the- the-- [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yup.
Clint:: [crosstalk] I agree.
Travis: --the concept of. My favorite moment was when the three of us were in Captain Captain Bane’s office, and he handed out drinks, and there was no editing in this, there- n- we- the three did not discuss it, we all independently decided that we weren’t going to drink the drink.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint:: [Wheezes]
Travis: And it was, it was- like, I’m not even joking when like, I got chills in the moment because it was this very, like, you know, like, sympatico moment of, picturing this scene, and not trusting what was going on.
Griffin: And I think what was really great about that is it doesn’t come out of rolls, you weren’t doing- you could’ve done...this is- this is that- that scene I haven’t really thought of it that way Travis but it’s a perfect- it’s a perfect sort of, uh, like it’s a perfect little capsule of what this show is--
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: --which is you guys- you could’ve rolled an insight check. Merle you could have used that- that earring that you bought in that first arc that gives you advantage on insight checks, to do an insight check on this dude to see if he’s on the level, offering you these drinks. You could've done an investigation check. You coulda done a nature check? To see if like, you could identify the poison in the- you didn’t do any of that, we just talked. Like I was doing a character, and you guys your characters, and we just talked, and in that conversation you came to the decision not to- not to-- [crosstalk] drink it.
Justin: Well I- well I think that you also got a- a- a very strong- to give credit where credit is due, it’s a good example of, um, like, storytelling--
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: --by implication, like, why, like we’ve seen enough books and movies, like why is this guy tryna to get us to drink something. Like--
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: --and it- and honestly that attitude gets us into trouble with this show--
Travis: [crosstalk] Yup.
Clint:: [crosstalk] [Laughs]
Griffin: [crosstalk] It do- you can’t- you can’t chalk that up to that because like, literally every other time, that I’ve set a trap, you’ve fuckin’ fell into it. I- like, I keep the kid-gloves on a lil’ bit ‘cause I don’t want you guys to die, ‘cause I feel like from a storytelling perspective that’s, just not interesting. Uh, but like, I- this might be rough for you to hear Dad, Merle didn’t need to lose his hand. Like, I was fully- I was 50/50 on whether or not you would grab that crystal. I was literally- I literally did not know which way that was going to break. Um, [crosstalk] so like--
Clint:: [crosstalk] Good. I’m glad you didn’t know.
Griffin: --you guys all realizing not to do that was like- that was really powerful, for me.
Travis: ‘Cause here’s the thing, frankly, I play Magnus in such a way that I’m perfectly willing to accept the fact that he will probably die. Like, I- I- I am not protective of Magnus ‘cause I don’t- I don’t feel that that’s a good way to play a fighter whose main characteristic is that he rushes into shit.
Griffin: Yeah, sure.
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: So but like, there was something in that moment that it was just like, yeah like I think we were all on the same page, not in the same room, like we’re not like side-eyeing each other and kinda going ‘I don’t trust this’--
Justin: Yeah.
Travis: --like we all just kind of went like, ‘Yeah, no, we’re not gonna do this.’
Clint:: Okay, that kinda ties in- and we have to honor Drew Davenport--
Griffin: Yeah sure.
Clint:: Drew- Drew sent this in. He says, ‘After the Grand Relic storyline ends, what changes can the listeners expect’. You know, you were just talkin’ about Magnus dyin’, ‘Will you guys reroll characters, switch who DMs, or add new players?’
Griffin: We’ve talked- so we’ve talked a little bit- ‘cause the- this storyline has- has an end. An I’m gonna be like- I don’t know if we’ve talked about that, that might be- that might be rough for folks hear, but, there is - there is- there is an end to what we’re doing in this universe. And I dunno if there’s like, a- a potential for a sequel or whatever, but I mean we’ve talked abou- I mean Travis has- now we have The Adventure Zone Nights, like we have another story that we can transition to. What we talked about though, I was really excited about, is each of us doing pilots essentially for our own thing, where we would do like, a couple of episodes, and we would take turns DMing coming up with our own worlds and stories and characters and shit, and then just doing a straight up and down vote for what people wanted us to do for the second season. I guess- I mean, if you wanna call it that.
Clint:: I’ve already got an idea about mine.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint:: That’s for real. I wanna do a- I wanna do a superhero one.
Travis: [crosstalk] And see ‘cause--
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m gonna try and make mine horseshit, ‘cause there’s no way I’m DMing, ever, [crosstalk] I’m not gonna- I ain’t doin’ that.
Travis: [crosstalk] [Laughs]
Griffin: [crosstalk] No but see that’s- that’s exactly why I want you to. Like I wanna hear what you would turn out. I think we all gotta do it, like we can’t--
Justin: Like, I don’t think you wanna hear what I would do.
Clint:: [Laughs]
Griffin: No, I absolutely do. If yours is like, we’re in a fuckin’ clown college, and like- I wanna hear that. I wanna hear- like I think that’s really neat.
Travis: [crosstalk] W- well let me--
Justin: [crosstalk] No it would be me looking around my office like, ‘And um, and then the big Bioshock poster comes over to you and he’s like, ‘What the guitar is goin’ on here?’’
Clint:: [Laughs] And the- the picture of Charlie Gale [?] comes to life!
Justin: Yeah and then my Abraham Lincoln bust is like, ‘I’ve got monsters in my pocket too.”
Clint:: [crosstalk] [Laughs]
Travis: Uh, well lemme say that, if you’re listening to this and you’re like, ‘But I don’t ever want this to end’, you- trust me you do. It would hit a point where we wouldn’t have new ideas for what Magnus and Taako and Merle would get up to and it would get stale. And like--
Griffin: [crosstalk] And like, it’s not gonna be--
Justin: [crosstalk] [sarcastically] And it- and if you really, really, really don’t want it to end, I mean if the money’s right…
Clint:: [sarcastically] Oh yeah, cause we’re whores.
Griffin: [Laughs] No, th- no, you’re not gonna fuckin’ George R. R. Martin me.
Travis: We won’t- we won’t end The Adventure Zone [crosstalk], it’ll just change.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No.
Clint:: [crosstalk] And we won’t- and we won’t kill off the Dowager, it’s okay, it- that’s fine.
Travis: I might kill off Magnus, I’m not above letting Magnus die.
Griffin: W- what gives me a lotta hope though, is like, the- the- The Adventure Zone Nights went really well, I feel like.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Like I- I- I- I think any of us would be capable of doing this, and- and it’s still gonna be the four of us. So like, no matter what, we’re gonna...you know. It’ll still be the same...I think there’s like a tone that sorta pervades our show as it is now that would be- that would exist in it no matter what world we were doing, like, if I did- if- if we did like a- I wanna do like a Persona style like, teen mystery. Like, but--
Clint:: [Laughs]
Griffin: --I think we would still do- I think we would still have- it would still very much be like The Adventure Zone, in it. You know what I mean, like-- [crosstalk] I think, I think there is just no way we could keep this thing going in perpetuity because that would- that would- whatever ending that would have would be disappointing. Like, I- and its not going to be anytime soon, it’s probably going to take us, it’s gonna take us a while.
We’re probably close to the halfway point to what I’ve got written down now? But I have no idea how long these things take. The crystal kingdom arc has already gone like a couple episodes longer or it’s going to end up going a couple episodes longer than I thought it was going to take. So, yeah, there will be an ending, we’ve talked about how to get past it- let’s talk about the MaxFun Drive though.
Clint:: Ok.
Griffin: Let’s talk about those levels that are up there. Obviously, five dollars a month you get access to all the bonus content, the art, the national treasure book of secrets of content. At ten dollars, you get the show exclusive bandanas- which look really great--
Travis:[crosstalk] and the bonus content.
Griffin: --and the bonus content. Twenty dollars a month, you get the Maximum Fun Adventure Necessity Collection which includes a multi-tool, toilet paper, a badge, basically camping supplies. You also get the bandana and you also get the bonus content. Thirty-five dollars you get the thermos and all the other stuff that we talked about already. What if you want to go bonkers, Dad? What if you want to go zany?
Clint:: Like a hundred dollars?
Griffin: Like a hundo a month.
Clint:: Oh my gosh, Griffin, we’re not made of money!
Griffin: We’re not donating, you silly boy.
Clint:: A hundred dollars a month, if you do that, you have membership in the inner circle. That is our monthly culture club and I think you three guys know exactly what that means.
Griffin: [Laughs]
Travis: Yeah, so let me break that down for you, basically along with all the other reward levels you get, you also will once a month get some form of media or some kind of cultural thing picked out for you by a MaxFun host. It could be a book--
Clint:: [crosstalk] Exactly.
Travis: --it could be a movie, it could be music, it could be some other cultural media but you’re gonna get that once a month--
Griffin: Last time we did it, for My Brother, My Brother and Me, we picked the album Music Evolution by everyone’s favorite funk rap jazz fusion band Buckshot LeFonque.
Travis: --And it was awesome and you’re welcome. But you’re gonna get that along with all the other stuff. And at two hundred dollars a month, which may seem like a lot but let me first say that’s a lot of support [Crosstalk] that goes a long way-
Griffin: [Crosstalk] Hey gang, that’s just like seventy cappuccinos.
Travis: Just like seventy cappuccinos a month! It could really add some years to your life to stop drinking so many cappuccinos. But along with all that other awesome stuff, you’re also gonna get free registration for MaxFun Con 2017 and believe me when I say: It’s totally worth it. MaxFun Con is the most fun an adult can have in this world.
Griffin: Yes, we- but- those are--
Clint:: Legally.
Griffin: Yes--
Travis: Legally.
Griffin: --those are pretty high levels, we’re not expecting everybody to chip in a hundred bucks a month that’s- that’s unreasonable. Just like, if you like the show and you want to support us you know five bucks a month is fine. Ten bucks a month is fine. We- the support we get, the financial support, is great it’s allowed us to do more stuff with podcasting than I ever thought we would ever do.
Like, when we did two tours last year for MBMBAM, that’s- in my wildest dreams I never would have expected that that would be the trajectory that our life would take. But it has because of this support. So like the gifts and stuff are great, the money that we get to help us like expand and do more stuff is great but really it’s just like, the support we get for doing these shows and the- just sort of the symbol of you guys showing is like this stuff that you’re making, the stuff we like and want you to do more of it- that’s what means the absolute world to me.
Travis: There’s a couple more things that I want to make sure everyone knows about. One, we have challenge donors so--
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: --no matter how much you donate or what level there are donors who are committed to giving a little bit here and there for every new and upgrading donation. And also I wanna say that our goal of five thousand new and upgrading donors will not only help us- will not only ensure that we do more Adventure Zone Nights but after last year, where I had a new My Brother, My Brother, and Me tattoo design because we hit our goal, I’m now having--
Griffin: You’re not!
Travis: --I’ve got a Dungeons and Dragons design in the works, that if we break that 5000 [crosstalk]
Justin: [crosstalk] You mean Adventure Zone design
Clint:: You mean Adventure Zone?
Travis: Yes. It’s an Adventure Zone specific--
Griffin: You’re gonna get fucking--
Travis: --If we break five thousand donors.
Griffin: You’re gonna get a tattoo of Drizzt’s face on your butt.
Travis: Exactly. I also—What Griffin—what’s the deal with toast MaxFun again?
Griffin: If you tweet the link maximumfun.org/donate to your friends—you know times are tough and we totally totally understand if you just like spread the word about the MaxFun Drive, it means a lot, and if you do that while using the hashtag toast to MaxFun, you’ll be entered into a drawing for John Hodgeman’s favorite product, which we are assuming is a toaster, and I guess [crosstalk]
Travis: Well we don’t know.
Griffin: Well it must be a dope-ass toaster if Hodgeman’s a fan of it. And one other thing I wanted to talk about that’s kind of adjacent- MaxFun Drive adjacent- MaxFun meet up day March 22nd, 7:00 pm, whatever your local time is. Go to maximumfun.org/meetups, people are organizing MaxFun community meetups all across the country. You can go to that website and you can find out like if one’s happening in your city, if not you can email Stacey, that’s S-T-A-C-E-Y at maximumfun.org and set one up and they’ll addit to the page. Which is again, maximumfun.org/meetups.
Travis: So—
Clint:: Wait a minute, out of continuity, just for a second. Because I thought about this since last year, Trav would it take away from your tattoo or would it up the ante and add to that too if I agreed to do it too?
Griffin: No, no, no! Come on, what?!
Travis: My tattoo is very specific to me, it’s a [censored].
Clint:: Ok. [laughs]
Griffin: That’s really good.
Justin: Dad should be a [censored].
Travis: [laughs]
Griffin: That’s fucking great.
Clint:: I’m serious about this.
Griffin: You want a tattoo of a testament to your failure on your body forever?
Justin: [laughs]
Clint:: Yeah, I do.
Justin: Well, Ok, let’s not commit—
Clint:: [crosstalk] Ok.
Justin: --Let’s not commit to what the design is. But Dad will also get- we’re talking about two tattoos. If we hit 5g- 5k.
Clint:: I’ll do it.
Travis: If we hit 5k new and upgrading donors, me and Dad will get Adventure Zone tattoos.
Griffin: Oh my god.
Clint:: Yes.
Griffin: I love it.
Clint:: I will.
Travis: I have—so I have one question and we can— and then I think we should each ask Griffin a question.
Justin: And I will, and I’ll like up the ante even more—
Clint:: Yeah.
Justin: I’ll cash those check, dirty money, 2016.
Clint:: You’ll probably have to drive me back from the tattoo place, cause you know I get that thing about blood. Yeah.
Travis: [Crosstalk] Real quick—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Justin and I are just gonna go if we get 5g just spending spree. Live fast die young bad girls do it well! Live fast die young bad girls do it well!
Clint:[?]: You sound like a Dalek.
Travis: Now you’re on a jet! Griffin! Mark wants to know, and I’m very curious about this, would you ever consider one off guests do NPC voice work?
Griffin: Naw. I just can't figure out how it would work. It's hard--it's hard enough like just modulating my own shit and like editing that in in post is rough--like I don't...It would also like be weird because they'd get this--They wouldn't be having a conversation with you, right? Would I have to tell them what to say? To--like it's just...
Justin: It would’ve had to be something like- I mean like, some- I’m glad you did it the way you did it, but like- if we had gotten somebody to do the Crystal Kingdom songs...
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Something like that-
Griffin: Something non-discussion-based, something that’s just like a broadcast.
Travis: I actually have an idea for it, in Adventure Zone Nights.
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: That I’m really looking forward to implementing. [crosstalk] I don’t know how I feel about it now. (? {1:14:28})
Griffin: [crosstalk] I br- I briefly thought about reaching out to Hodgeman to do the Hodge Podge voice since that’s who he was based on.
Clint:: [crosstalk with Travis] What if he did a-
Travis: [crosstalk] But then he would have to do it with us, because…
Griffin: Yeah, it’s not- yeah ‘cause he’s answering questions.
Clint:: But what if we did a live podcast in New York and got your little “play buddy” to- to be on and play an NPC?
Travis: You mean Lin?
Justin: [incredulously] You mean Arthur Miller, Dad? [Everybody else laughs]
Justin: He’s been dead for 40 years.
Clint:: I had really- that was it, I thought if he took some scenes from All My Sons.
Griffin: [sarcastic] Yeah.
Clint:: It would be so appropriate.
Travis: Exactly.
Clint:: Yeah, okay, fine! Stand in the way of another idea.
Griffin: I wanna do this recap. But before we do that, we’ve talked about like, questions from everybody else. Do you guys have questions about the campaign, things you’re still confused about that you want to ask about- keep in mind that I’m not going to reveal any like, big spoilerinos or anything like that.
Travis: I- I have one Griffy.
Griffin: Hit me.
Travis: Have we- has there been a point so far where you were like, really super like laying out some kind of clue that our characters were supposed to pick up, that we just breezed right over that you were like, “Aw dammit, you guys.”
Clint:: And don’t say red barrels!
Travis: Yeah, don’t say red barrels. I mean like, story arc-wise, we were supposed to put together that the Red Cloaks were such-and-such.
Griffin: There have been a couple, yeah. And it- it’s, uh, it’s not like bad that you missed them or whatever. Because it’s like, I think that, uh- nobody’s gotten it right, like looking at the- the- the Reddit, or the Twitter or whatever, like people guessing at sort of the- the whole storyline because like, I think it’s impossible. There’s- there’s pieces missing that you’re not gonna get for- for a little bit still. Um, there’s some people who are like kind of getting a little bit… close? Like, to sort of the shape of the thing?
Um, but yeah, there have been things that have been said that really, to be completely frank, I’m mostly putting down so that whenever the thing is revealed, there’s at least some groundwork being laid for it. But it’s- it’s- I- I think you would have to be pretty… man, like obsessed with the thing to sort of put the pieces together. ‘Cause there have been clues- like I’ve- there have been clues about the whole… the whole campaign arc in each arc, to answer your question. You’ve- I feel like you’ve gotten some of ‘em, um, some of them you probably just- just- {1:16:35}
Justin: You know, I’ll tell you what I really struggle with is I think that like, I would be better a- at this, and the show would be better, if I like...went back and listened to it from the beginning.
Griffin: Well-
Justin: I just- I can’t- it’s like an exercise in egomania [crosstalk] that I just can not touch.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m about to- yeah, I’m also about to do a full recap, which might help a little bit. {1:16:52}
Travis: Mkay!
Justin: Yeah.
Clint:: But I do that all the time! I listen back to ‘em!
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint:: [softly] Oh my gosh.
Travis: Well I only listen to my parts.
Clint:: Ohhh.
Travis: So that only helps so much.
Clint:: Yeah, okay.
Griffin: Um, Dad and Justin-
Clint:: Yeah you guys keep talking about some other podcast we do?
Justin: Bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit, my part!
Travis (???): What are those? [Clint:: I don’t know]
Justin: Bullshit bullshit bullshit.
Griffin: Uh, Dad and Juice, you guys have any questions?
Clint:: I actually have one.
Griffin: Okay.
Clint:: Was there something in your upbringing as the third child whose every birthday was ruined or a disaster that makes you take out all this anger and animosity on poor Merle?
Griffin: Um, I had a lot of people ask me that. During this arc, there’s a- there’s like- gang! There’s a-
Clint:: Are you workin’ through some stuff?
Griffin: No there’s- but there’s a re- there’s a story reason why you are the person being harangued. And it’s not just like- I’m not just picking on your character, that would be petty and little. There is a- there is a story reason why your character’s being harassed the most in this- in this particular arc.
Clint:: Well, and- but you’re also pretty strident about the rules.
Griffin: Oh, please!
Clint:: You’re pretty hard on me.
Griffin: I have let you get away with so much fudgin’. I don’t wanna hear it.
Travis: [crosstalk] You- you fudgin’ cleric-
Griffin: [crosstalk] You’re the fuckin’ cheesecake factory. You are a- you are a, like, tourist trap strip mall in Pigeon Forge just fudge fudge fudge all over the fucking place.
Clint:: I can- I can live with that. What about you, Juice? You got a question for ‘im?
Justin: Yeah, on, um...like, My Brother, My Brother and Me- which was the first podcast the three of us did together- it is very much a show that is built around...like, it’s an improvisational comedy show. So like we’re- we’re...creating structure and like destroying structure, like, as we do the thing.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: Like constantly sort of like, throwing shit away the instant it stops like, being funny or worthwhile.
Griffin: Yes.
Justin: Um, in- in the course of like, doing it- is it hard to, um...is it hard when the four of us are recording and you’ve got like something of a Bible that you’re working off of or- or a plan at least, in your head, like-
Griffin: I have a text document called Plot Bible in my- in my folders.
Justin: Okay. Is- is it hard to like, resist the impulse to not just like, throw a pipe bomb in it from time to time- or to...like, throw shit out in the moment because it feels right, like from a storytelling perspective. Is it hard basically is what I’m saying to have something that you are [crosstalk] beholden to-
Griffin: [crosstalk] Right, right.
Justin: -other than the exact moment [crosstalk] in the story.
Clint:: [crosstalk] I can think of a- I can think of a couple of times where I thought he had done that. I don’t wanna say what they are though.
Griffin: Yeah, well, what’s great is- and it’s been really really helpful and it’s really unlocked the writing of this show for me, and I’ve mentioned it earlier- is this idea of having a macrostory and a microstory, and adhering to the macrostory and letting you guys do whatever the fuck you want in the microstory. I would say you guys- any adjustments you’ve made to the, like, grand campaign? Like the whole thing from start to finish? Have been...not you making a decision that has gone against my plan, it has been more you guys suggesting a characteristic or referencing something that I then think “Oh that’s fucking great, I’m gonna add that to the thing.”
So it’s not that- you guys have done very very little to destroy or ever disrupt the whole campaign. You have, if anything, added to and enhanced it. And the s- the- the whole story, when it’s finished, will only be what it is because of the things because of the things that you guys have suggested. And to fully part the kimono, things that other people have suggested, too. And that might be-
Travis: Griffin, that actually leads to a question we got a lot, just real quick-
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: People have asked, when this is all done, would you think of ever like, releasing this [crosstalk] as it would be a really good reference.
Griffin: [crosstalk] It w- I don’t- I don’t think it would be- no, I don’t think it works. Because it’s not like a campaign book. It’s not like the fuckin’ like Curse of Strahd like- it’s based on what your characters do it’s a story- like it’s a story. I have it written down like a book, and when you guys change it, I rewrite the book. But at the end of it, it’s still a book. It’s not a- it’s not a, uh, adventure guide, you know what I mean?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Also, like, I also do a lot of fudging in terms of like character stats like- the- like Curse of Strahd, just to keep using that example, uh, there’s like a monster entry for the main boss of the- the thing and it’s like two pages long! And it like breaks down all the stats and like the saving rolls and like its characteristics and its specialties and its abilities and its spells and wh- I don’t do that for fucking anybody! So I feel like, I feel like there would be some pretty ginormogaps. Um-
Clint:: Well, and there are also other media.
Griffin: Yeah, sure-
Clint:: I mean people adapt stories into other mediums.
Griffin: Abso- Absolutely, but to get back to the original question: the macrostory you guys haven’t changed at all. But what’s really helpful about the way I structure it is that the microstory- you guys can go hog wild. The- the- I mean already like...the- the Crystal Kingdom thing has gone sort of a different way than I originally intended. Which is perfectly fine, ‘cause I think it’s a better way. The mystery that you guys solved- which that was the hardest thing of all, writing a mystery and then trying to get you guys to solve it. I was really worried that-
Travis: You mean in the train one?
Griffin: In the train mystery, yeah, I was worried you guys wouldn’t, like, just wouldn’t...get to it. And it’s not- it’s not- I’m not calling you dumb, I’m saying like I wrote the thing and I had no idea how easy or difficult it would be to solve. I comple- I think I bit my eyes-
Justin: You can’t- you can’t hint to it at all, like you can’t point, or like- you can’t even nudge us toward it.
Griffin: Right! ‘Cause I- I- I think my eyes were maybe a lil’ bit- I- I- I think I maybe overreached a bit? I’m happy the way it turned out but like, I think the mystery was maybe a lil’ too- too difficult. I think it was a little too [crosstalk] out of my hand-
Travis: [crosstalk] Well especially since we don’t have an investigative, like, rogue character-
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Whose job it is to like [crosstalk] solve puzzles and study shit.
Griffin: [crosstalk] And that’s why- that’s why-
Travis: We don’t play it that way.
Griffin: I intro- I introduced Angus as a surrogate for that stuff who could like help you out if you needed it, and he certainly did from time to time, but when- I think it was Justin finally kinda cracked the case…
Justin: Yeah, let’s never forget.
Griffin: It was a big sigh of relief, for me. So- but like- thing- you guys have done things that I have taken entire- the Crystal Kingdom Plot Bible? Just this Plot Bible, just for this one arc, is a- has a- is about...14,000 words now. It’s a- it’s gotten ridiculously long. But I will- I will delete pages of shit. I will g- highlight all, delete. Like entire- entire fights. There was a fight that was supposed to take place on top of the train, Trav, that you just blew right by.
Travis: [disappointed] Aw man!
Griffin: I know, it was gonna be sick as fuck.
Travis: Let’s circle back! Bonus episode! [Griffin laughs]
Griffin: So- but that’s what I’m talking about. An- and it’s helpful, I don’t know if it’s helpful for GMs in us- in- in...a broader sense, or just for this particular storytelling type of thing we’re doing, but preserve the macro, keep the- keep the big campaign going and preserve it and defend it as much as can. Change it and add it if you think you have ideas that are better but- but try to protect that macro storyline as much as you can, but while- while allowing your heroes to like… just go hog wild on the- on the micro level.
Clint:: Okay, let me be a dad just real quick before we get to the summation of everything else. Let me just tell ya, an- and I know the other guys- and Travis has gotta tell you st- Travis has done a great job on uh, on Adventure Zone Nights, whatever we’re gonna call it-
Travis: [excitedly] Adventure Zone Nights!
Clint:: Gr- I, Griffin you really have knocked it out of the park when it comes to DMing this. I think you’ve raised the bar, you’ve set the mark really high for us when Travis and I do it, uh-
Griffin: And Justin!
Clint:: And Justin. Justin’s never gonna do it.
Justin: [low and creepily] Never gonna do it.
Clint:: But seriously, I- the work you put in is, uh, is really obvious in- in the show. [crosstalk] And- and I think the work put in-
Travis: [crosstalk] And very specific to us.
Clint:: Yeah! And it adds to the- I think it adds to that flexibility that it is able to be that kind of story.
Griffin: Yeah. I appreciate that. It’s like...it’s- and I- Travis I’m sure you feel this way now too about Adventure Zone Nights, it’s like...it’s terrifying, putting it together. It’s really scary.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: ‘Cause you don’t- you don’t-
Travis: I went into it like-
Griffin: You were not-
Travis: Scared in a way that I didn’t think I could feel about presenting a game because I poured [crosstalk] so much-
Griffin: [crosstalk] To us! To your family members who you’ve known your whole life!
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Yeah it’s-
Travis: I was worr- I was not worried about people listening. I was worried about how it would play out because I’d poured all of this work into like building…
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Puzzle dungeon rooms, and I was like, “What if we start playing and they either solve it in 30 seconds or they never solve it, or they start playing and it doesn’t make any sense?”
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And like, it’s fucking scary!
Griffin: But it’s not- it’s not just that, we also can’t get- like we can’t ignore the fact that we’re fuckin’...makin’ up fantasy stuff! And that’s like- there’s a vulnerability there. You know what I’m talking about?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Like when y- when you- there’s a vulnerability, an inherent vulnerability, and wh- in roleplaying, even when you’re dealing with this- literally, the le- the lowest stakes imaginable, which is my family, like and I don’t- like, I- I have very little shame when talking to and dealing with you guys, but even then it’s- it’s still really embarrassing but then at the same time, it is the most fulfilling- creatively fulfilling thing that I’ve- that I’ve ever done in my whole life. It really, genuinely is. Um-
Clint:: And Justin, daddy loves you too.
Justin: Yeah, I do my best. Whatever.
Clint:: Good job.
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright, let’s hear the summation!
Justin: [crosstalk] Let’s do the summary.
Griffin: Alright. Step in wherever you want, ‘cause this is- it’s, uh, it’s beefy. Um, but I feel-
Travis: We should probably let you just get through it.
Griffin: Yeah, maybe.
Justin: Yeah let’s just, yeah.
Griffin: Um- if I forget something, that I’ve left out. Anyway, here it is, the-
Clint:: [interrupting] Well we won’t interrupt you.
Griffin: Well no, please do if you hear something I’ve forgotten. The complete summary, of The Adventure Zone saga-
Clint:: [interrupting] Well it wouldn’t be right if we interrupted you-
Griffin: Oh my god.
Clint:: -because you can’t- you know, that way you won’t [crosstalk] be able to (he says something here at {1:26:00} but I can’t hear it under Travis)
Travis: [crosstalk] This is Dad’s favorite joke.
Griffin: Yeah, this is the- [crosstalk] let’s start with the prequel.
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s his favorite joke.
Griffin: I don’t have very many notes here. It was- “our heroes met.” That’s the prequel episode.
Justin: Done. That’s it.
Griffin: Uh, [crosstalk] Here There Be Gerblins-
Justin: [crosstalk] I’m just kiddin’.
[TAZ theme starts playing]
Griffin: Uh, started off with us adhering to the Adventure Book. You three had to, uh, prove your salt. You were hired to escort Gundren Rockseeker’s belongings from Neverwinter to Phandalin, uh, and uh, he had a ward named Barry Bluejeans. En route, you found that they were attacked by gerblins and abducted.
Um, you reached a cave, uh, that housed the gerblins that attacked them and you met uh- uh, Klaarg, the bugbear leader of the band, and Yeemick, his second-in-command, and were embroiled in Yeemick’s short-lived plot to overthrow Klaarg who, in turn, just murdered Yeemick. Taako charmed Klaarg? And, uh, we learned later, apparently permanently? To learn that Gundren had been kidnapped by a powerful wizard named the Black Spider, who wanted to use him to unlock Wave Echo Cave, a source of tremendous power near Phandalin.
You rescued Barry Bluejeans, who told you how to access the cave using Merle, who’s Gundren’s distant cousin, uh, using Merle’s blood. Uh, after fighting through the strange fauna and machinery of Wave Echo Cave, you meet a few interesting individuals inside, including Killian, uh, who is an extremely capable orc woman who uh, warned you not to meddle in her own pursuit of the Black Spider, and then you met the spider himself, who is a dark elf named Magic Brian, who you kind of befriended- and then summarily killed.
Uh, and then the three of you with Killian and a worse-for-wear Gundren Rockseeker entered the vault in the middle of Wave Echo Cave uh- uh, not before Taako finds a powerful umbrella-shaped staff on a skeleton wearing a red robe. Uh, inside that vault you find a gauntlet which Gundren takes as his birthright but it grants him a fiery power that he seems incapable of controlling. He flies from the room. You pursue him to Phandalin, stopping a convoy of orcs slavers, uh, and you free Kurtze, who is a young orcish boy, who uh- who’s campment had been destroyed by Gundren. Um, uh, you rescue him from a cage, although he leaves without thanking you.
In Phandalin, Barry warns you that Gundren has grown too powerful before Gundren, who is now just made of living fire, destroys Barry Bluejeans. You nearly talk him down from his rage but Kurtze, in retribution, shoots him with an arrow from outskirts of town. You three and Killian dive into a well at the last second as Gundren goes thermonuclear and Phandalin is reduced to a circle of black glass. Killian explains that she represents an organization designed to stop these things from happening and enlists you after you are able to reclaim the gauntlet, uh, without falling prey to its thrall. Killian summons a glass spherical vehicle from the sky which you ride up to a hole in the moon.
[Music stops]
Travis: And let me just jump in now and say, yes we caught that the thing with the red- uh, umbrella had a red robe. Thank you everybody that keeps like tweeting that at me.
Griffin: Well, okay, [crosstalk] but in their defense-
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, we got it.
Griffin: You definitely did not remember that.
[Madam Director starts playing]
Griffin: Uh, next arc was Moonlighting where you were introduced to the Bureau of Balance and enlisted. You emerged into a hangar on top of the other side of the moon, which you realize is fake. Uh, you got a wicked headache, you’re nauseous for some reason, but you’re aided by Avi, the hangar manager, who offers you a stiff drink. Make your way to- across the quad of this strange outpost and Killian puts you on an elevator in the center of the compound where you are- meet Johann, a musician that is lamenting that few people planetside will ever know his musical genius.
He introduces you to the Voidfish, a gigantic jellyfish-shaped organism whose body seems to be filled with flashing streaks of light. It’s capable of consuming information and removing that information from the world, save for those who drink its ichor. After inoculating yourselves you remember years of war and turmoil that you had forgotten during which nations, tribes, and uh, individuals fought for control over a few powerful magical artifacts.
The Bureau of Balance’s Director, a tall, older woman carrying a white oak staff who does not reveal her name, explains that there are seven Grand Relics in the world, which are items of unchecked power created by a band of rogue wizards called the Red Robes. Her organization, the Bureau of Balance, finds, recovers, and destroys these relics, which she demonstrates by having her servant, Davenport, a gnome capable of only saying his own name, put the gauntlet, the uh- uh, Phoenix Fire Gauntlet, which belongs to the school of evocation, into a large, spherical chamber, where it is pierced by beams of light and seemingly destroyed.
She offers you jobs with the Bureau as the Reclaimers, which is a sort of rare position, uh, dedicated to actually bringing those relics back without falling prey to their thrall, which is something few people can accomplish. After passing an initiation test, you are fitted with bracers of initiation and rewarded tokens to the Fantasy Gachapon, and its operator, the Artificer Leon, shows you how to get goodies out of that. You also are introduced to the Fantasy Costco and its owner, Garfield the Deals Warlock. You level up. [tiredly] Holy shit.
Travis: You got this, you’re doing great!
[Music stops] [Pan starts playing]
Griffin: Alright. Murder on the Rockport Limited. A relic’s been discovered by the Reclaimer Leeman Kessler, who was unfortunately murdered in the town of Rockport after loading his precious cargo onto a train, the Rockport Limited, en route to Neverwinter. You’re assigned the job of impersonating Leeman and seeing the train to its destination, at which point you’ll be able to retrieve the relic from storage. After a brief detour in a leech-filled swamp outside of Rockport, you make your way into this town of industry, which is apparently home to hundreds of people who look like beloved radio personality Tom Bodett. [Justin laughs]
Griffin: You board th- you board the train after learning the security measures-
Justin: I can’t believe- I still can’t believe you planned that by the way, Griffin. That’s a- this is just the craziest storytelling.
Griffin: Uh, did you guys know that’s on his Wikipedia page?
Travis: Yeah, he actually got asked about it on the show on [crosstalk] NPR. {1:31:04}
Clint:: [crosstalk] [in awe] No!
'Clint: laughs]
Griffin: Yeah, y- you board the train after learning its security measures. The relic is in the cryptsafe in the last cart of the train which cannot be opened without an hour of prolonged contact without a- from an employee of the train. Uh, you’re introduced to your fellow passengers on the journey, including Hudson, the engineer who stays locked in his engine car, Jenkins, the magical attendant who operates the Pleasure Chambers- there’s a kind of teleportation magic that can take you to any enclosed room as long as it keeps the door open- Jess the Beheader, a prized fighter and all around badass, Graham the hedge wizard, who didn’t end up having that many interesting traits, and Angus McDonald-
Travis: He was juicy! He was juicy!
Griffin: He had a juicy robe.
Justin: Juicy!
Griffin: And Angus McDonald, precocious boy detective. After meeting them, you’re investigated by Angus, who explains that he’s on the train in pursuit of a serial killer in Rockport who seems to be capable of tracking down objects of great wealth and collecting them from their deceased owners. After revealing this, you hear a scream and find a beheaded and behanded Jenkins between cars. Some sort of fiery crab monster destroys the crime scene before you’re able to do much CSI work on it. Uh, through a series-
Justin: I know you’re pretty sad about Jenkins right now, but just hang in there.
Travis: Stick with us, folks!
Griffin: For this next sentence, uh- you work through a convoluted mystery to discover the truth. The body was not Jenkins’, but the engineer Hudson’s, who was spliced-
Justin: Told you so.
Griffin: Who was spliced between-
Clint:: Whaat!
Griffin: Uh, portals by Jenkins’ teleportation magic. Magnus, uh- does a daring maneuver outside the train and gets rid of the whole fucking great fight I was gonna do back there. Uh, you fight, uh-
'Clint: laughs]
Griffin: -Jenkins, and throw him off the back of the train, seemingly to his doom. You recover the Grand Relic, which is the Oculus, which allows you to turn illusory images real, and with some quick thinking from Taako, prevent the runaway Limited from running into Neverwinter, uh, saving Graham, Jess, and Angus in the process. The An- uh, Oculus is recovered and destroyed.
[Griffin exhales a breath and the music fades]
Griffin: Uh, and then there’s a brief Lunar Interlude where you guys have a harvest festival at the Bureau of Balance. Um, some fun stuff happens, but really the only thing of consequence is you witness an event where the sun eclipses, the sky grows dark, and you see millions of glowing white eyes in the sky. Uh- there’s a deafening sound that inca- incap- incapacitates nearly everyone around you. Magnus eats a unicorn dick.
Travis: Yeahh! And it was the best part of the whole show!
Griffin: Uh, just a couple [crosstalk] more-
Travis: [crosstalk] Everyone agreed the unicorn dick joke was choice. He won a lifetime achievement award for it.
Griffin: Very good. A couple more arcs to go. Almost there, almost through it. [Battlewagons starts playing]
Griffin: Petals to the Metal. Another Grand Relic is discovered in the prosperous town of Goldcliff- the Gaia Sash, which gives its owner absolute power over nature. It’s in possession of a master criminal named The Raven. You arrive on the scene of a crime in progress and scale the Goldcliff Trust, which is under attack from some giant vines summoned by The Raven. Taako, after blinking into the Ethereal Plane, you see figures with white eyes seemingly spying on you.
After intercepting The Raven on the top floor, you- uh, she seems somewhat peaceful, and not wanting to harm any of you. She also seems kind of outta control. You’re saved by Hurley, a halfling monk, lieuten- lieutenant in the Goldcliff militia who seems to have some sort of relationship with The Raven, uh, uh- and calls her by her true name, Sloane. The militia captain, Captain Captain Bane, who’s also a Seeker in the Bureau of Balance on the secrets- on the secret level, uh- tells you to follow up with Hurley for more information. You learn that Hurley and Sloane were teammates in the Battlewagon Racing League, an underground racing league in Goldcliff where racers duke it out in the desert while wearing animal masks to hide their identities from, uh, spectators. {1:34:01}
Hurley believes beating Sloane in a race would convince her that the power given to her by the Gaia Sash is not infinite and tells you to sneak into the headquarters of a rival racing league to steal the Arcane Core, which she would use to power her battlewagon. You do so, murdering a couple of their members in the process, like Barbara, uh, and enraging their leader.
During that race you cleverly disable the wagons of your opponents, including the giant shark tank driven by said gang leader, and beat Sloane in a neck-and-neck finish. It's too late though - the Raven has been completely corrupted by the Gaia Sash, entombed in a tower of living vines and surrounded by a tornado. You crash your battlewagon into Sloane in an attempt to free her but to no avail. She surrounds herself in silverpoint, a poisonous barb with no known remedy and Hurley throws herself - uh, throws the three of you to safety, jumping into the fray.
You awaken in the middle of town. Sloane is holding a severely poisoned and wounded Hurley and she gives up the Gaia Sash before using it one last time to turn the two women in embrace into a beautiful cherry blossom tree. After debriefing with Captain Captain Bane he seems to, uh, insist that you drink this suspicious cocktail he's whipped up. You wisely refuse and see him taken over by a figure that seems to be a floating red robe. Under his command, Bane drinks his own drink and dies instantly. The figure explains that Sloane, Magic Brian, Jenkins and Bane all fell prey to a hunger for power that eventually consumes all, before he disappears.
Uh, another Lunar Interlude, where some developments have happened: you are promoted and selected as the organization's only Reclaimers. You get a new sweet dormitory and learn that your prior roommate Robbie has been arrested for unknown reasons. Angus the boy detective becomes -
Travis: Is Robbie Pringles?
Griffin: Pringles, yes.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: Uh, Angus becomes your sort of personal aide while in the field -
Travis: Our girl Friday.
Griffin: Your girl Friday essentially. Um, you are given information on Captain Bane and told to feed it to the Voidfish as it’s custom for Bureau of Balance members who die to be forcibly forgotten. During your visit to the Voidfish's chambers you meet Lucas, a scientist and consultant to the Bureau who seems to want to study the Voidfish back at his lab, which Johann refuses. Your argument is interrupted by the Voidfish, who sings a mournful song which Johann swears he did not teach it. LAST ONE.
Travis: There's also a really nice moment of connection between Magnus and the Voidfish, I just wanted to - like, they touch the glass. [crosstalk] It's really nice, you guys. [crosstalk] (Some ""Yeah""s, can't catch what else)
Griffin: [crosstalk] That’s really important, yeah. Uh, yeah, you guys have a nice moment. Uh, and then the Crystal Kingdom arc, which we're on now. It's Candlenights, which I've kinda forgotten. Um, you're celebrating in your dorm with your friends at the Bureau, giving and receiving presents, including a set of strange badges emblazoned with an unreadable type, given by an anonymous donor.
The Director is contacted by Lucas, who calls her by her real name Lucretia. He explains that he has a Grand Relic, the transmutation - the Philosopher's Stone, which belongs to the school of transmutation. Uh, but that something in his lab has taken it and used it to turn the exterior of his lab into pink tourmaline. The spell, uh, is still being channeled, meaning everything the crystal touches is also turned to crystal. His lab is sinking into the Stillwater Sea and if it touches it, the world will get crystallized and destroyed.
You're sent to his lab with another party in tow, a team of Regulators sent to arrest Lucas for his abuse of information. That includes Boyland, a gruff dwarf fighter, Killian, and Carey Fangbattle, a dragonborn rogue and sister to Jeremy Fangbattle, a bard introduced in the Flop House switchup episode. The team of Regulators is separated during the fierce winter storm. The three of you enter a conservatory, which has been crystallized, and are attacked by a golem which has self-formed out of the shards of crystal. You escape and hear a song sung by a synthetic voice, um, but you can't quite piece together what is going on there.
Um, you might have, at this point, but [clicks]. After besting a few traps, including the puzzle robot Hodge Podge, you meet Noelle, a helpful floating robot powered by a large glowing fuse in the middle of her chassis. Uh, you find a peculiar mirror in Lucas's private chamber, which shows you sights from our world, and find an abandoned bedroom belonging to Lucas's deceased mother Maureen. You meet a family of bugbears who Klaarg once belonged to, all of which have behavior modification chips which make them pretty chill, uh, and you also find a very dead Boyland who has been crystallized after having a smoke by an open window in the lab.
After a few more run-ins with the golem, which seems to only want to attack Merle, you regroup with Killian and Carey, and Merle is tricked by the golem, who speaks with a man's British accent impersonating Pan, Merle's god. Uh, he entices Merle to grab a crystal which shatters and pierces his hand. Magnus quickly chops off his arm to stop and save - [Travis: Heroically.] heroically, some might say - to stop the crystallization from spreading to his whole body. You are whisked into the medbay, where Lucas treats Merle's wounds and gives him a new arm made of soulwood, a living wood with psychic capabilities. He takes you to the Cosmoscope, a room filled with gemstone windows into other planes of existence, which he crafted using the Philosopher's Stone. The room is designed to show - to allow the user to study those planes and perhaps see what lies beyond them.
The seven of you, including Lucas, Killian, Carey and Noelle, make your way towards the elevator in the centre of the complex, but Killian and uh, Carey, turn on Lucas to arrest him before he can get closer to the Relic. The crystal all around you changes forms a few times and Lucas disables your whole party by activating a trap in your null suits, which is protective outerwear which has kept you from getting crystallized this whole time. Lying paralyzed on the floor, the golem appears in front of you once more. That's where we're at.
Clint:: And I would like to say that this is usually the point where I pretend I've been out of the room [crosstalk] and didn't hear any of that.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, fuckin’ thanks for not doing that, I appreciate it.
Justin: Yeah.
Clint:: That’s alright.
Griffin: That’s it! That’s the story so far.
Travis: Wow.
Griffin: I don’t know if there was stuff in it you guys forgot about, um, but I tried to include everything I could. Umm...
Clint:: I haven’t done shit in this show!
Griffin: That’s not true!
Clint:: I haven’t done anything!
Griffin: That’s not true!
Travis: Well he didn’t like, break down-- there’s like thirty-five hours of stuff that he just did in fifteen minutes, he left out a lot of our awesome antics.
Clint:: We do have antics.
Travis: Oh, do we have them? Yes we do.
Clint:: And goofs?
Justin: Alright, one last mention: maximumfun.org/donate if you like our show, if you like other shows on Maximum Fun, uh, network, we- we’d ask you to visit there, try to kick in what you can every month, it means the world to us. Again, for just five bucks a month you’re gonna get a ton of bonus content, exclusive stuff that you won’t find anywhere else. Uh, for ten bucks a month, you can get all that plus a bandana with your favorite show’s imagery on it (those are original designs). For twenty bucks a month, you’re gonna get the Max Fun Adventure Set, and that’s got like the paracord bracelet, the hot cocoa, and the multitool and-
Clint:: That even has adventure in the name!
Justin: Yeah, adventure right in the name, um, so if you can do that, and thirty-five bucks you get the thermos, plus all that other stuff, um, and again this is for new and upgrading donors, so if you’re already at one of those levels and you want the gifts, you’re gonna have to kick in- kick in a bit more. So, um-
Clint:: And we love our listeners more than those other guys put together.
Justin: Yeah and maybe you started listening to some new shows on Maximum Fun this year, and so you want to kick in a few more bucks, that’d be awesome.
Travis: And, and if you-
Justin: maximumfun.org/donate is the address to do that.
Travis: And if you do become a new or upgrading donor, be sure that you tweet at us so we can say thank you. Um, you know, let us know that you did it. And, the other thing that you can do to help out, if you already are a new or upgrading donor, and you’ve done your part: make sure to share the message of Max Fun Drive, let everyone know that it’s going on, you know, be sure to tweet about it, tell your friends, talk about it on Facebook. Um, you know it only goes for 2 weeks, and we- we really just want this one to be the best one yet! And I know we say that every year, but we want it to be the best one yet every year, so help us be a part of Max Fun. Come to the meetups, um, on you know, on the 22nd, I think there’s gonna be another live, you know, special to end Max Fun Drive on the 25th, so look out for announcements about that. Um, #ToastToMaxFun to be entered into that drawing. Um, yeah, just help us make this Max Fun Drive epic.
Griffin: Please.
Clint:: Well put, Scraps, well put.
Travis: Cuz I wanna get a new tattoo!
Griffin: Yeah, that’s- that’s uh, that’s it! We’ll have a new episode next week, um, which will be just another, regular episode in the Crystal Kingdom thing but we’re also gonna be talking about the drive, um, and then uh, we’re back to- back to normal, back to basics after that. So until then, thanks for listening to The The Adventure Zone Zone. I think it actually got a lot more interesting than I thought it was gonna be. I thought it was going to be super uncomfortable [crosstalk] the whole time.
Travis: That pretty much sums up The Adventure Zone though, doesn’t it?
Griffin: Yeah, I guess that’s a good point.
Justin: Thanks guys!

[The The Adventure Zone Zone theme]
Griffin: Um, I guess I’ll walk us in.
Travis: [elongated] Yeeeeeeaah.
Justin: Um, yeah, do it. Wait, no, let Dad do it.
Griffin: Alright
Justin: Dad’s a radio guy.
Travis: Yeah, Dad can do this!
Justin: Give us a nice cheesy—
Clint: Okay, you want a nice cheesy open?
Justin: Yeah.
Clint: [Enthusiastic, cheesy radio voice] Hi everybody and welcome!
Griffin: Oh my.
Clint: We’re back with another TTAZZ! That’s right [Justin giggling] The The Adventure Zone Zone, that’s where the guys get together, have a little confab, answer your queries [Griffin sighs] right here. The The Adventure Zone Zone, take it away, fellas!
Justin: I wanna thank our father, uh, who is cosplaying as every Simpsons character you’ve ever hated. [Clint & Griffin laughing]
Travis: You know, it’s funny, somebody asked us—
Justin: All together in one human.
Travis: Somebody asked us why Dad, uh, both his character in Adventure Zone and Adventure Zone Nights is kind of like, sleazy, and it’s like, ‘Oh! Well, that’s just our dad if you tell him “Do a voice”.’ [Clint laughing]
Justin: Sleazy, sleazy guy!
Travis: Do a voice, Dad. Okay.
Clint: [imitating] I could’ve done Casey Kasem.
[Noises of disgust]
Griffin: You couldn’t have actually, legally, um. Hey everybody welcome back to The The Adventure Zone Zone. It’s been a minute since you’ve been here, huh? Like a year maybe?
Justin: Show— This show within a show.
Griffin: This show within a show. This— Uh, what’s the show on Twin Peaks called that everybody watches? The like—? Oh whatever, it could not be less important.
Justin: Oh, Appointment To— Oh, god.
Griffin: Yeah, shit. That’s gonna kill- I said that specifically to torment Justin for the next hour and twenty minutes, or however long we go here on The The Adventure Zone Zone.
Justin: Uh, Invitation to Love.
Griffin: Invitation to Love.
Justin: Phew.
Griffin: Um, we’re gonna answer a bunch of questions that people sent in, and talk about making the show, and— I think maybe it’s a little weird timing, considering there’s not that much left in the campaign, and maybe it made more sense to do this once everything was completely over 'cause I imagine a lot of the questions I, as the DM, won’t be able to answer, 'cause I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
Travis: I tried to be very careful, I wanna say: I tried to be very careful— It’s so funny to me that like, when we announced this, we were like, ‘We won’t be doing spoilers’. The sheer number of people—
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: —like ‘What’s gonna happen?’
Griffin: ‘Who dies? Who’s gonna die? Tell me all of them! I want a list of all the deaths.’
Clint: Safe to say— Safe to say that you had at least what, twenty responses? Trav?
Travis: Twenty, twenty two. No, it was probably in the range of about four thousand? [Clint makes some kind of noise] Um, no exaggeration, it took me about three hours to go through the question. Lot of duplicates—
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: But we tried to, uh, go through the questions and ones that we can actually answer without ruining too much. I will say, there’s some stuff in here that’s probably gonna touch on what’s happened up ‘til this point, so if you’re aren’t caught up—
Griffin: Sure
Travis: —to episode 59, this is just kind of a pre-emptive, like, we’ll probably talk about stuff—
Griffin: We’ll definitely talk about stuff.
Travis: —that’s happened in all 59 episodes, so.
Griffin: Yeah, I think we’re gonna need to, like, unpack a lot of stuff that actually happened in episode 59 to sort of set up the next episode of the podcast, so if you haven’t listened to 59 yet, don’t listen any further to this one until you go back and finish it. Seriously.
Clint: And why haven’t you?
Griffin: Yeah, it was a pretty good episode, um—
Clint: Yeah, it was.
Griffin: Should we get going, or—? I don't know, I don't know, I forget the format of this. Who asked—
Travis: Well, this is— this is different. I think last year we asked each other, like, questions that we had, and this year we kind of put it up to the audience, so how about this: Let’s just all kind of take turns grabbing questions and asking each other, and I’ll start off with this, 'cause this is, uh, kind of a soft ball for Griffin. This is from Neil D: What’s the production process like for an episode? How long does it take to put each one together?
Griffin: So, we record usually a couple of days before the episode goes up and we go for—what do you think?—like I think most episodes are, like, on average like an hour fifteen or something like that? Um—
Justin: Yeah, when we record? I should mention, just as a caveat, we haven’t gone back and listened to the original The The Adventure Zone Zone.
Griffin: Yes!
Justin: So, in case we’re doubling up on answers, uh, tough shit, I guess!
Griffin: Yeah, sorry. I cut a lot out when I edit, which I usually do the day or sometimes the night before, because my, um, life is in shambles. And uh, I cut like a lot of— I cut a lot of stuff out, like this is the most heavily edited thing I make?
Um, and so just like cutting down the recording to something that is listenable without like, long long pauses for rule checks and um, like, decisions on what actions to take, uh, I cut like, maybe a fifth, or, to a quarter out of the whole recording, and that takes a really long time, and then I record the ad break and then I levelate (??) that, get that sounding good and then I cut the intro together which can take a long time if I have to pull— For episode 59, I had to pull a clip from episode 28 I think, and like fucking finding that needle in a haystack took me a really long time.
Justin: What was it?
Griffin: Uh, it was like a clip of Johann, talking about being, like, sad about the idea of being erased. {5:30}
Griffin: Um, and so, like, that can take a while. And then music recording—varies pretty wildly? I recorded the, I think the fastest I've ever done it was the TAZ Nights bonus theme from this year? Which I knocked out in, like, a half hour. Mostly using, like, premade loops in GarageBand. If I lean on those it’s a faster process.
Other songs like the chalice song took me fucking days to get that one going. Usually the music, I have a big longer lead-up time. And then cutting all of that stuff together can also take a really long time just, like, mixing all of the different tracks and sounds and shit together. Especially, like, episode 59 had I wanna say, like, fifteen different music cues in it? And it took me, like, half a day to make that. So like, some episodes take me days and days and days.
Justin: It doesn’t help that my brother, Griffin, refuses to break out of the Fifty Shades of Grey style relationship he has with Audacity.
Griffin & Clint: [laughing]
Justin: And will not free himself from its—from its beautiful, fuzzy shackles.
Griffin: Well here’s what I say about—Audacity sucks but, like, I've gotten to a point now where I've gotten pretty good at like doing it fast. like, I—
Justin: Just let me open your eyes to the power of REAPER.
Griffin: I know. Um, so, the answer to that question is, like, it takes a long time. I work harder on this than like anything and it’s just because, like—and I'm working harder and harder and harder, like, the past couple episodes? Like, I have doubled the amount of production time that went into it and I'll probably keep doing that to the point where, like, the very last episode of this campaign will probably take me, like, all—I will need all two weeks to get it going ‘cause I wanna stick the landing.
Clint: Let me add something to this too that I think will also answer a lot of other questions that we got in a kind of roundabout way. Most of, if not all, I would say, of the editing that you do, Griffy, is to clean things up...
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: And it’s never, ever to change the story. That’s—that’s one thing I've… a lot of people ask about, like, did we know Griffin was gonna do this or did we know? No. There really is none of that involved.
Griffin: Yeah—
Clint: It’s really making it up on the spot as we go along, not on Griffin’s part but on ours.
Griffin: Right.
Clint: And Griffin doesn’t—is—is anal about not lettin’ us know what is coming and so there’s never any editing, I don’t think, you know, to, like, change a story element or take somethin’ out.
Griffin: Yeah, like, yeah. I get what you’re trying to say. There’s no, like, me saying like, “alright Merle, do this!” and then you do it and I erase my… prompt or whatever.
Clint: No, we don’t. That doesn’t happen. {8:10}
Travis: Well, that’s—that’s one of, uh, one question of about fifty, so we’re on— We’re averaging seven minutes per question.
Clint: [laughing]
Travis: Doin’ great.
Griffin: How about another one?
Justin: Are you deletin’ these as we read them, Trav?
Travis: I'm marking them so you’ll see a bunch of dashes on each one we do. [Someone knocking.]
Griffin: Cool.
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: I—can I read this one from Tickle Pickle, @Dissimon on Twitter, he says, “How early in the campaign did you have the whole plot sorted out in your head properly? When did you start dropping hints?”
Griffin: Um, and the answer to that one’s kinda tough to come by, but, like, I really did have most of the structure of the plot done by the end of ""Gerblins"". Like, I knew… most of that. [crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Let me ask you this, Griffin, let me turn it a little bit: what point in there, ‘cause we start—""Here There Be Gerblins"" started with like, the pre-written, like, box, you know the red box campaign.
Griffin: Right.
Travis: What was the first kind of divergence from, like, the prewritten where you’re like, “okay, this did it”?
Griffin: ""The Lost Mines of Phandelver""? There— I followed— Here’s how we followed it: you find the dead horses in the road, yes. You go to the gerblin cave, yes. You fight the bugbear, yes, although, like, I don’t think the bugbear’s name is Klaarg in the book and I don’t think you’re supposed to have tea with him and hang out, and like, that’s where things were like, ""Oh, it’s more fun if we do it this way.""
And then, like, you go to Phandalin, yes. And then, like, I think we jump straight to Wave Echo Cave after that? And that is the end of that book and we skipped the middle 90% of that book where you go and hang out with, like, an emerald dragonling and like, there’s a big castle. Justin actually—Okay, this is fun. When I was in Huntington for the—when we were all in Huntington for the TV show shoot, Justin ran a game of D&D for the Smirls that I played along with and you actually did some of the stuff in that book. Like, we went to that castle—
Justin: Yeah, it was fun. You missed all the good stuff.
Griffin: Well, yeah.
Travis: [laughing]
Justin: (??) —over there.
{10:00}
Griffin: But I mean, the—the thing is like, I think by like episode 3 I realized I wanted to get off the book so we jumped ahead to the end of the book, essentially.
Justin: Now, now this is my question though, Griffin, and this is something I've always kind of been curious about… um, what was your, like, plan when you started, um. Like, did you plan to just hop from… like, prewritten campaign to prewritten campaign? Or what was the…
Griffin: I don’t think—I don’t think I had a plan. I think I—’cause when we—
Justin: Dang.
Griffin: When we did the first episode, it was under the guise of you are on paternity leave, and so like, this was a filler and we didn’t even know this was gonna be a podcast. So when we started my mind was in this mode of “alright, well let’s just get an episode done so Juice can have a break.” And I think that’s been a detriment, I think to the show? Because there are—there—it’s tough, like, goin’ back and listening to those, that first arc, and some of it I've had to kind of… um, try to work into the bigger campaign?
But like, I really didn’t have that bigger campaign until that after that first arc was over? and I think that did us maybe a little bit of a disservice? ‘Cause it did take me a while to start dropping hints, right? Like. ""Crystal Kingdom"" is when I realized, like, I had the idea in mind for like, what the structure of the arc was gonna be, ""Crystal Kingdom"" was—I started to do some fuckin’ work to drop hints. That’s where you guys did like, the whole cosmosscope and learning about the idea of like, other planes and this other maybe evil? Plane? That was coming? And, like, the red robes showing up and all that stuff started really hittin’—hittin’ the pavement in ""Crystal Kingdom.
Clint: Wait a minute, though, I'm gonna call you on that because, you know, goin’ back and adapting ""Here There Be Gerblins"" for the graphic novel, I've noticed a lot of things that either you were… brilliant in adapting or you were brilliant in just—like, there was a red robe in… you know.
Griffin: Yes. Yes.
Clint: And you—and so you know— But there are elements that I pick up all the time—I will leave notes for Callista, our editor, on the side that says, “I swear to god, this was in the episode.”
Griffin: Yeah. Um…
Clint: Is that more—was that more you just going back and retconning or was it…?
Griffin: No, that—that—that’s one very specific example of like, me dropping— I guess that was technically the first hint, although, like— That was the first red robe we see, right? And the red robe served sort of integral to the secret plot that you all learned about in the last couple episodes, so. Yeah, I guess that was sort of the first hint. But really, like, um, the last thing I wanted was for, like, all of this stuff, when it was revealed, for it to have no hints leading up to it whatsoever? Like, no, like, oh— I fuckin’ hate it in like, video games like JRPGS where like, you’re playing it and then the final thing happens and it’s some big bad that you, like—it has never been referenced before, you know what I mean?
And it’s just like, “I'm the big evil, uh, force of—force of evil that you didn’t know about until just this moment! And I'm the one you have to kill in order to win!” I didn’t want that to happen. Like, I wanted there to be some lead-up. So there’s stuff like the patches you first got during ""Crystal Kingdom"" as a Candlenights present, um, that was a hint. There—I tried to—""Crystal Kingdom"" was, like, every episode I was trying to drop stuff on y’all that would set this up.
Travis: Well, so this next question, um, is, I guess ties into this ‘cause it’s for Dad and it’s also for Griffin and I think it’s a good example of what Griffin’s talking about as far as, like, the stuff from the first arc and Ian asks, “If Merle came from another set of planes—”
Griffin: [chuckling]
Travis: “—how could he have been related to Gundren Rockseeker? His blood opens the doors?”
Griffin: I got a good—I got an answer for that, but it’s not. That’s—that’s—that, my answer for that sucks and you’ll learn about it in… the next couple episodes? But it sucks, but that is—that’s the kind of shit I'm talking about, yes. I've set up this thing where, like, you guys are from another reality, right? You’re from another dimension or whatever. How can you have a—cousins in this world? And it’s like, well. Yep. Justin & Travis: [laughing]
Griffin: You got me, it doesn’t…
Clint: That doesn’t bother the DC multiverse. You got, Superman’s from Earth 1, 2, and 3, all livin’ on Earth Prime and they’re still related to other bei—I don’t know if that’s, that’s…
Griffin: That’s—no, I mean, they got me there. That was a good loophole. Here’s the thing: if you go back and you look for loopholes—and this is not a judgement, like, yep, you got me, fair play. ‘Cause that one I realized, like, at fuckin’ 1 AM one night I woke up with a start, like, “Ah, shit! He can’t have relatives here!” There’s gonna be stuff like that. And that’s what—that’s what I'm talking about, that first arc I just didn’t have it yet. I didn’t have—I didn’t know, at that point, I didn’t really know that they were from this other reality and so, like, I would just say some shit. And I'm sure there’s a lot of stuff like that and, um, I'm—I'm—I regret that, it’s a bummer, but. What can you do? Pobody’s nerfect!
Clint: Alright, let me—let me ask one, can I ask one?
Travis: Yes, do!
Justin: Yeah!
Clint: I got one that I think all thr—four of us can answer and it’s from @FrillyIceCream… [pretty much all of this is crosstalk]
Justin: Finally I get to talk and not just eat chili.
Clint: @FrillyIceCream says…
Griffin: Are you eating chili again? ‘Cause you were eating chili during the last recording.
Travis: Goddamn, Justin!
Justin: I’m on slow carb, baby! [shouting away from the mic] I only eat chili!
Griffin: That’s a good life. That’s good work if you can get it.
Justin: [laughing]
Clint: “How did the popularity of the podcast affect your outlook on the story and characters? When did you become invested yourselves?” [link]
Griffin: I’m curious to hear your boys’ answers to this.
Travis: This is a really good question.
Justin: Uh, I’ll tell you when I became invested was after… Okay, so, I made Taako and there was not a lot of, uh, elements to Taako that I had figured out early.
Griffin: Well, because you and dad took the pre-gen character sheets that came with the starter kit,
Justin: Right.
Griffin: And kind of put names on ‘em and there’s your—there’s your guys.
Justin: And some have argued that I decided to name him Taako in the exact moment that I opened my mouth and said Taako.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: You didn’t?
Justin: Some have argued that. [chuckling]
Clint: I would argue that!
Travis: His—historians have theorized.
Justin: Historians have theorized. Um, and there was a period where I just made him… dumb? Does everybody remember the period where I made him, like, wicked stupid for no…
Griffin: Yeah, he was just a trash bag there for a bit.
Justin: And I didn’t—and I did that because… I, I, I didn’t think he was funny enough? So I thought it would be funny to make him dumb and then—and it wasn’t ‘til I tried to do that that I started bumping up against, like, ""oh wait a minute..."" Like, that’s not right. Like, that’s not who this character is and that’s not who the person is. And so that made me feel ownership.
Justin: The weird thing about the show getting bigger is that in a way, I feel like less ownership now. And like—and in a good way, I think, in a healthy way. But, like, I see all these different permutations of Taako and he’s like, still a character I made up and that’s cool, but, I also think it’s cool that other people have their own spin on Taako and their own sort of take on him, um, and I think that’s really neat.
And I wanna encourage that, I think that’s—it used to irritate me, I think, from a consumer perspective when I would see creators do that? Like, ""I don’t know, the decision is yours, it’s up to you,"" but, like, as a creator now I find that really interesting. Like, I find it really cool to let that space exist.
Griffin: I struggled with that for a bit ‘cause it felt, um, to be like noncommittal about canonical, um, look and design and aesthetic and all that, like, felt, um... I don’t know, fanservicey, in a way? In a way that I think I kind of struggled with for just a little bit but I kinda realize, like, I don’t think it’s us dodging some sort of essential question about what these characters look like, I think it is to us, actually, um, taking advantage of what is a pretty singular benefit to this being an audio medium. An audio-only medium, if this was any oth—if this was any other kind of medium, like, we couldn’t do that. And I think, it’s important to me that this show has, like, good representation?
‘Cause I—I—that’s—that’s important to me and I know it’s important to our listenership and I—I’ve—I feel like, and I try to do that with the characters that, um, the NPCs that y’all come across, but, like. I feel like this is a really cool way of doing that, of just saying, like, whatever interpretation you have, go for it. And because this medium doesn’t have, like, these canonical visual takes, then just let it ride and nothing’s—nothing’s wrong, everything is permitted.
Travis: Yeah, I—I hope this doesn’t sound like a dodge because it’s absolutely true; I don’t picture anything when I picture Magnus.
Clint: Mm-mm.
Travis: Like, I just don’t think that way? So, like, I see a lot of different…
Justin: Well, think about it. You’re seeing it from, when I envision scenes that are happening, I’m seeing them from my perspective.
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: Like, I’m seeing them from— I don’t see Taako doing stuff, I’m envisioning myself looking at the stuff that is happening around me through Taako’s eyes.
Travis: It’s like Myst, you know what I mean? like, I don’t see…
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: I don’t see my PC. And so, like, when I see, like, fanart and I see people’s drawings I’m like “yeah, that could be Magnus!” Like, “Yeah, in a universe, that’s Magnus! Yep! Mm-hmm!” And so, like,
Clint: And I think we… Go ahead, I’m sorry.
Travis: It’s just, it’s just never for me, like, this is my—and so it’s more like, for me, I—one of the weirdest things, as far as the popularity and like, investment in the characters goes, one of the weirdest moments I ever had was, I used to look through the Reddit—I don’t anymore, not because I begrudge anybody posting on Reddit, but it started to bleed into like, decisions I made? And I wanted to remove myself from that. But like, after an episode went up, I saw somebody post a comment, “that’s not what Magnus would do” about something I did as Magnus?
Clint: [chuckling]
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And I was like, wait, what? What do you mean, “that’s not what Mag—” I am Magnus! What I—what Magnus does is what Magnus would do! and it was—like, I could not pretzel my brain around it. And it was, like, okay, to this person, this is what Magnus does and anything that di—but the thing is is like, people don’t work that way? Like, in real life? There—like, it’s not like, this person is good and so they never mess up, they never do anything bad, like, that’s just not— And so like, when I first started making Magnus it was pretty one-note heroic meathead who rushes into things.
Griffin: [sighing] Well—
Travis: Somebody talked about, like, the rogue, like, “that’s very un-Magnus-like to do a train in rogue!” And it’s like, yeah, but like, after a while he—of just rushing into things and almost dying, like—
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: There’s a certain amount of learning that comes from that, so characters grow and change.
Griffin: I think generally speaking, like, the investment that you all sort of have—and this is just my perspective as the DM, but I also think when the listeners became more invested in your characters—and this is definitely something we need to take to heart whenever we do whatever the next thing is for The Adventure Zone, um. That investment came when you all expanded—when the definition of your characters expanded beyond your Dungeons and Dragons character class. Because when we started, you were a wizard, and you were a fighter, and you were a cleric, and that was pretty much it?
But like, I feel like your characters really took flight and the show, frankly, like, got pretty good, when you were the disgraced former TV chef, and the, uh, carpenter—the carpenter whose town and home was destroyed, and the deadbeat dad who is kind of a hippie cleric with shaken faith. Like, that stuff that goes beyond you just playing your roles is when shit got really, really good. So no matter what we play next, if we play some, you know, fuckin’, uh, what? Like, uh, space game, like, I don’t want you guys to just be like “well, I made an alien and I made a pilot and I made a gunfighter.” Like…
{22:27}
Travis: I will say, Griffin, not to judge someone else’s game, but if there’s an RPG game where there’s a class that’s just “alien” it’s not—I don’t know about that game.
Clint: [laughing]
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah, it sounds like that might be…
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, there’s…
Clint: I will tell you. I will tell you a crystallizing moment for me. And it’s—it—it’s not the joke you think I was gonna make.
Travis: Aaah!
Griffin: Ah!
Clint: I think by the time we got to this moment, we knew somethin’ special was going on. And with my hand to God, I think ""abracafuckyou"" was a—was a turning point because that was one of the hardest I’ve ever laughed at anything we’ve done and it was—that—I know that sounds strange, but to me, that was kind of a distillation about what was so special about what we were doin’ that to me, that was a big—that was a big turning point.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: I did, I saved the show. Here’s another question.
Griffin & Travis: [laughing]
Justin: Saved it from mediocrity, we would still be soldiering on in mediocrity if not for me.
{23:26}
Clint: Sure!
Justin: Here’s a question. To me.
Griffin: Do you, you want me to ask it?
Justin: Um, yes. Why don’t you ask me that. And then I’ll ask one of you guys a question to you.
Griffin: Which one is it? Uh, this one’s from Taako’s boyfriend, uh, @goldclifftrust who says to Justin, “How much satisfaction do you get from blindsiding Griffin with new spells?”
Justin: None!
Clint: Next question!
Justin: No, I mean, it— The very short answer is, I wanna do… Taako’s life is dope and he does dope shit. That’s fact. And it do-- there are a lot of spells. Everytime I do a spell, like that, it is a balance for me of, like, doing some hardass stuff that is cool. But also, like, I don’t wanna mess up the thing?
Clint: Mm hmm.
Justin: And as much as Griffin says you can’t mess it up, you definitely can—
Griffin: No, you can super fuck it up. Defo. Def def defo. Yes.
Justin: But he always tells us that, like, he’ll figure it out. But, like— I don’t want to break his thing. So, like that’s always the balance for me. It is in no way about blindsiding Griffin with spells. If anything, it is a professional and familial curiosity as to how he will adj— course correct to what I am doing in any given situation. But it is never with the intent of, “Take this, Griffin,” because like, we could do that—
Griffin: Oh, dude, you could. Episode, episode, your first episode on the moonbase is like, Okay, I attack the director. Okay. [strained] That’s it! Thanks for listening, everybody! Bye!
Travis: Let’s— Let’s spin that into— there was— a lot of people wanted to know, Griffin,
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: if there were moments that were kinda fucked up of your planning?
Griffin: Sure.
Travis: Based on stuff that we did.
Griffin: This ranges- the answer to this is— [Weird-ass Griffin noise “uh yeahhhhh”]— I got— Here’s the thing, and I could spend a really long time talking about this, but like, the biggest thing I struggle with doing, being a DM and also being the DM of an actual play podcast, and those are two different jobs, with two different, sort of, demands.
And I think every DM has to make up this decision on their mind is, how much control over the whole narrative—the macro narrative—do you give the players, and how much do you keep for yourself? And I talked about it in the last The The Adventure Zone Zone about like how I try to give the micro story over to you guys, and like do whatever you want, while still trying to keep my hand firmly on the wheel of the bigger picture, um. And so that gets me in trouble.
Sometimes there are episodes, like I think all the lunar interludes have been an example of this, where just like I kinda need to take the wheel pretty much entirely because fuckin’ episodes— this last lunar interlude, 58 and 59, I had a million threads that I had to pull together? And so that meant I was talking a lot of the time.
I saw some people say like ""well geez Griffin just give the other boys a script if you’re gonna do that"" which I don’t appreciate necessarily, because y’all still— I feel like I still give you like the opportunity to do your own stuff. Not only that, when you guys had this conversation about Magnus you shouldn’t get back in your body I was like uhhhh fuck that wasn’t, like— I kinda thought you would, and then all of the sudden that next episode was completely different from what I thought it was going to be. So, like, I don’t think you’re necessarily completely on rails. But—
Justin: Griffin has never forbade us from doing anything.
Clint: Uh-uh, nope.
Travis: If anything, honestly, one of the things is like—D&D is a very collaborative game in my experience, and like, if your DM—and, not to judge anybody’s play style, but if you feel like, uh—the host of One Shot RPG commented on like, that I apparently said in an episode “this is important to me” so Griffin like, went along with it.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And like, that’s how the game should work? So like, there’s stuff that we’ve wanted to do, and Griffin says like, “Yep,” but also simultaneously, we see, like, our DM is crafting a storyline, so why would we fuck with that just to fuck with it?
Griffin: Well, that’s a—
Justin: Here, let me give you an example of, like, this in action, right. In the beginning of— I guess it would have been towards the end of 58, beginning of 59, Dad and I were in a scenario where Travis knew—Travis had some idea—
Griffin: Oh, that made—magnify all of the, like multiply the complexity of all this by a billion thanks to the fact that like, I made it so that one of the characters knew kind of what was up, and the other two didn’t, and I kinda like, expected all of you to go along with it and you did not.
Justin: Yeah, well, we said to Griffin—and I don’t know, this probably wasn’t in the episode, but—at one point, we had to say to Griffin like, “listen, we know we are headed toward something happening in the, um, in the moonbase, but we don’t—we’re not there. Like, as characters—”
Clint: And we were not—we were not down with crossing, going against the Bureau of Balance.
Justin: We just had no—we didn’t have the motivation yet.
Clint: Right.
Justin: And we could feel the narrative wanting to go there but like, we as arbiters of our characters, like, in order to be true to them, could not roleplay that. Because it was like— we just weren’t there. Like, we didn’t have it.
Griffin: Which, let me like—when I envisioned that sequence I just thought like, “Oh, well, if they’re down, it’s gonna be this cool sneaking mission,” and that’s not really how it approached. Also like, you told me that and I kinda tried to give you a little bit more justification with the, um, you hearing that voice telling you to trust Barry, which, um, I don’t know if I should say who that was but I’m pretty sure everybody gets it and, giving you that stuff with Angus who kind of like, backed you up.
Like I was like, “Okay, well I need to course correct and do a little bit more stuff,” and also you didn’t take the scene in the same way I thought you did; you fucking walked straight into it and were like “Yo, Director, what’s up.” Um, I—part of me thought you might just be like.. If you had been like, “Hey, Director, somebody’s trying to cross you, we’re not down with it,” I would have had to figure out something on the spot and I would have freaked the fuck out, but, I would have had to figure it out.
Justin: Well, we wouldn’t have turned on—this is the problem is we couldn’t—and where we were sort of had our hands tied is we also didn’t want to leave, we couldn’t have left Magnus hanging.
Clint: Sure, right.
Justin: The problem is we didn’t have time for literally an entire episode of talking about it between the three of us to try and figure out what was going on. And also, it didn’t matter because we didn’t have all the—
Griffin: The clues.
Justin: The parts. [crosstalking]
Clint: But at the time—and each arc really and truly is a Whodunit for us. It may not be a murder but there’s always a mystery that we’re trying to figure out as we go through it. I tell you, this kind of ties in with one of the things—and nobody asked this question, but—one of the toughest things for me—and yet, one of my favorite things about this story, these stories—are those, uh, ‘Jury will kindly disregard the witness’ testimony’ kind of things, where, not only—there are moments where our characters are not supposed to know what the other characters know, but then we as the player are not supposed to know, and it— But, listen, that’s a level of complexity that I think makes it special because it does make harder, and it forces us to be better actors.
Griffin: It’s, um, I’ve been listening to a lot—and I talk about this on Twitter and I may have talked in the last The The Adventure Zone Zone, but I listen a lot to a podcast called Friends at the Table that, uh—Waypoint’s Austin Walker runs their game, and they work in dramatic irony in a way that is just delectable, and so like—there’s definitely been a lot more of that in the last few episodes, of just like ""Clint knows shit that Merle can’t,"" and trying to play around that, um, as so often happens in Friends at the Table, is really really good shit.
Uh, I wanna get back to one last thing about this subject because I mentioned this spectrum and—there’s been talk about you guys fucking my plans up or whatever, and I think the reason you’re thinking like that is because we’ve been doing this this way, and I think it’s—the way it’s worked for us in which like, I am mostly guiding where the narrative goes and you all are reacting to it, but there’s another way of doing it in which I say, ""You guys are at a bar and these people are in the bar, what do you do?""
Episode 1, that’s it, and then you set fire to the bar and it’s like ""Okay well I know what Episode 2’s gonna be."" and I’m reacting to the things that you do, and I feel like that isn’t the best way— That’s just not the right way for us to do it, right, because I don’t know—I the DM, I the person running the game, I don’t know how to make a good story out of that.
Because it’s just, it’s gonna be a lot of cooks in the kitchen and it’s gonna be like, unless we do all get together at that point and say like, ""Alright, what are we doing with this thing?"" then it’s not gonna be this cohesive narrative, it’ll be you guys being, just, murderous bandits as you run across the countryside, like— You know what I mean? [Agreeing hums] Like, it’s really—and so I get really defensive about people saying, like, ""I wish Griffin would let the boys like, make more of a big decision.""
Because, to answer the thing that we haven’t even talked about which was the point of the question of like, things you guys did, uh, the whole ""Arms Outstretched” sequence where Taako soul-jars and you guys pull Magnus from death? I’m not kidding, I had a whole thing? In the Astral Plane…? Gone. Like, fucking gone. That was probably the biggest, most brutal thing.
Um, the chalice episode, which I think is probably the most important episode of the season—the series so far, where we like, finally get into your guys’ backstories, and then the chalice tries to tempt you, I fully fucking thought that Magnus was gonna take the offer, and I had two episodes worth of stuff—not, no bullshit, of like, parallel worlds and alternate timelines and like, dark—""the darkest timeline""-style shit happening, and you all trying to like, pull Magnus from the brink or like—I thought Magnus wasn’t gonna make it through ""Eleventh Hour"" full stop.
But, you didn’t take the offer, and so I was like ""Oh! Okay. Walk away from that."" And then there’s the littler stuff, like I mentioned in the last The The Adventure Zone Zone, like I had a cool battle on top of the train that Magnus kind of did away with with this wild acrobatics stunt. So like, I—I definitely take the reins in some episodes more than others when I need to like really get things tied down and tied back in because I’m trying to do kind of a complex thing? and I don’t wanna let anything go unresolved. Um, but at the same time like, it is not you guys reading scripts—I have definitely tailored like, the big picture stuff to like, suit the things that I think you all are enthusiastic about about your characters, and—and that’s the way I try to justify it.
Travis: So, before we answer more questions, the whole reason we’re doing The The Adventure Zone Zone is we are in the middle of the MaxFunDrive. So let’s talk a little bit about that, and we’re gonna fly through this and get back to your questions, and then we’ll do, like, a lightning round question section.
So, Maximum Fun is a listener supported network that means that we do some ads, but primarily the network and these shows exist because of listeners like you. So, once a year we do a two week drive where we ask you to consider supporting the shows and the artists that you love. We have a bunch of different levels that you can give at: For five dollars a month there’s something like a hundred hours of bonus content that you get access to. There's, um, I DMed a couple episodes of what we’re calling Adventure Zone Nights in a whole new—
Griffin: Hey, and let’s establish— let’s establish canon. Is it Knights with a “K”?
Travis: It’s Nights with an “N”— like it’s a play on like Baywatch Nights but—
Griffin: No I know I know I know I know I know I know I know, but it’s— this could also be a play on a play on Nights.
Travis: Ok sure, fuck it, yeah, it’s Adventure Zone Knights with a “K”, but it’s also in a quantum state where if you’ve ever spelled it with an “N” you are also correct retroactively. [Clint laughs]
Travis: Which, by the way, Stefin the Goldfish is also in a quantum state where it is both with a “v” and with a “ph” depending on if I remember how I’ve spelt it before.
Griffin: It’s all— it's an audio medium, folks!
Clint: And Steven’s ok, right? Stephen’s ok?
Travis: Oh, we’ll talk about that in a second, don’t—don’t get it twisted. But! So, for five dollars a month you get all that bonus content. And not just for Adventure Zone, for all the other shows on the network. And not just for this year, all the past years. It’s such a— such a bargain. And in the Adventure Zone Knights it’s a whole new world with new characters that I DM. Griffin—
Justin: [Singing] A whole new world~
Travis: Griffin, Justin, and Dad play as new characters. Justin plays as Troth, and she’s a monk Tiefling. Griffin plays as an eldritch bartender named Tom Collins, and Dad plays as kind of a disgraced blackballed bard named Lenny Manelito. And because we’ve hit 10,000 there’s going to be a part 2 to this year’s Adventure Zone Knights coming out very shortly, we’re recording that tomorrow. So that’s at five dollars, at ten dollars you get the bonus content—
Justin: By the time you’re hearing this we’ve already recorded it.
Travis: That’s true.
Justin: Twist!
{36:24}
Travis: Um, so at ten dollars a month you get access to all the bonus content. You also get your choice of an enamel pin, um, there’s one for every show on the network, and because we’re past ten thousand, if you are a ten dollars donor, after the—after the drive, you’re going to be able to purchase more pins, um, with the proceeds of that going to charity. Um, so at twenty—
Justin: [crosstalk] Nice.
Travis: At twenty dollars a month, you get a pin, you get the bonus content. You also get a keep in touch kit that has stationary, it’s got a rocket pen with four colors in it. You get a candle shaped like a rocket that smells like sharpened pencils and friendship, you get a rocket stamp; basically anything you need to keep in touch. And then at thirty-five dollars a month, you get the keep in touch kit, you get the pen, you get the bonus content, and you get some engraved beer mugs, um, engraved with the Max Fun rocket logo.
Justin: But you know what Trav, it’s not really just about the gifts. The gifts are nice, but what you’re really doing is helping to make more stuff you like in the universe. This show exists because of the Max Fun Drive, and it gave us the freedom to be able to create it, and we wouldn’t be doing it without it. So, like, by voting with your dollars—by voting with your dollars, [screen door creaking] you are helping to ensure that we make more cool stuff. And—
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah!
Justin: —that’s really, um, that’s really amazing. We—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah—
Justin: We so appreciate your support and all of that.
Griffin: This show has grown a lot, and that means a lot to me, and um, like, the Max Fun Drive is like one way, in addition to just like, seeing— seeing how big and how passionate the community is, that like, inspires me to spend more time on it, like—I wouldn’t spend a bunch of time writing music and doing all this—doing all this stuff and writing and pre-pro and stuff—if like, I didn’t think there was a demand for it, if I didn’t think that like people were going to get some level of enjoyment out of that. So like, this show is what is because of— because of the Max Fun Drive and because of the people who support it, so, um...
Travis: So if you love Max Fun, and you love Adventure Zone, please consider supporting. Go to maximumfun.org/donate, take a look at the different levels, see which one’s right for you, and if you’re already a donor, please consider upgrading, because we count towards that. We’re— I think we’re gonna hit twenty thousand by the end of the drive, but we can only do that with your help. Um, so boys? I would like to rapid-fire lightning-round some questions at you—
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Specific for each one of you, and we’ll see if we can just knock out some of these.
Griffin: Yeah, cause we literally have a hundred or so on here still.
Justin: Uh— Can I do one first?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yes.
Travis: [crosstalk] Go for it.
Justin: Uh, Dad, why does Merle not like Angus? {39:07}
Clint: Oh - um, actually that was a very legitimate character choice, ‘cause I’ve always kinda played Magnus— I mean played Merle as—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Clint: [crosstalk] See, I do it too.
Justin: [crosstalk] Fuck you guys still, to the moon.
Clint: See, I do it too. As a character who was really kind of insecure about his place on the team. He was never much of a team guy, and saw anybody that joined the party with distrust. If you look back, even Killian coming on, anybody that came on—
Griffin: Wow, I never—fuck, man.
Clint: I made the- I made the choice that Merle would always feel so insecure that, you know—what do they need him for? He’s a failed cleric, he’s short, [someone hitting their knee?] 90% of the spells he casts are failures, so anytime anybody came along with any level of competency, he saw that character as a threat to his position in the group.
Griffin: I feel bad for dumping on Merle in so many of the arcs, right? Like in ""Crystal Kingdom"" you were the one getting pursued because you had the highest death count, and now Pan has abandoned you, but I promise, that sweet— that sweet reward. I promise I have— I have plans for all you boys.
Travis: [crosstalk] Death. You mean death.
Griffin: [laughs] The sweet release of death.
Clint: The sweet release of death.
Travis: Okay, so, Griffin: who’s your favorite and least favorite NPC to play as and/or voice? {40:16}
[Justin laughs]
Griffin: My favorite is Angus, of course, um, although I’ve gone back and listened and there’s some pretty wide variations. The voice for Angus came from, um, one of the— it was a Superego sketch, and it was the one where they’re on the go—the, uh, like, one of the characters is on the tra— Superego is another comedy podcast that’s really good—um, there’s a sketch where’s there’s, like, this, just a guy on the train, and a bunch of weird folks come and talk to him—
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh gosh, I remember—
Griffin: And one of them was a ghostly boy—
Clint: I never knew that!
Griffin: Yeah, and uh, he was— he was— what does he say? He just talks about being ethereal and uh, [speaking in boyish voice] “Won’t you take my clammy, diaphanous hand?” [back to normal voice] or something like that. [laughter] I straight just lifted that from that. Although like now I just do [speaking in high-pitched voice] kind of a higher voice, hi [back to normal] um, and so,
Travis: [crosstalk] Alright, least favorite?
Griffin: [crosstalk] I like Angus, my least favorite is just any character that’s like [in deep voice] uh, down here, [normal voice] all like, twelve of them. [deep voice] Ahh, I talk in a low voice, I’m either Jenkins—
Clint: [interrupts] So it’s strictly based on voice, not character?
Griffin: I’m either Jenkins or I’m Johann or I’m any six characters. [normal voice] Like, yeah. [crosstalk] Um, I have like four—
Travis: [crosstalk] Um, Justin-
Griffin: I have like four voices that I try to do for everybody.
Travis: Justin, this is from [crosstalk] Rick Sanchez.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yes.
Travis: Have Taako and Kravitz been on other dates other than the one on the show?
{41:33}
Griffin: Hmmm.
Justin: I mean.. It would— You would be on the— I mean..
Travis: A lot of people wanna know this, Justin. They want to know more about the relationship between Kravitz and Taako.
Justin: But it is— but it— I’m not being flippant. It’s an essential, like, it’s an essential... disparate thing to me. Like it— I don’t— I don’t know, it wasn’t on the show. It’s up to you. Do you think they did? I don’t know. My part is done, like, I don’t have to do more. I did my part of it, by talking and recording it. Like, as far as I’m concerned, that’s my contribution to that stuff, and I don’t wanna fill in the grey areas where other people can like hang out and do whatever. I would, I would say, I’m sure— it seemed like they had a fun time.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, on the topic—
Justin: Like, I guess? It seemed like they enjoyed each other’s company. But like, I just don’t wanna— I really feel pretty strongly that like, stuff that wasn’t on the show, I’m not really interested in, in making like, ruling statements on, ‘cause like if I— Y’know, I wanna leave flexibility for people.
Griffin: Um, I, I just wanna hop in here and say, like, the demand for Taakitz content is like— yes, definitely. Um, it’s a lot, there’s a lot, there’s a lot of demand for Taakitz content, and I do wanna say, if only, fucking, Magnus had not been pulled from the clutches of death, we would have gotten a lot more Kravitz time, but uh, now that this—
Clint: Oh thank you. Now see, now you’re dumping on me again.
Griffin: No no no, this, that was [crosstalk] one of my fucking favorite things that you guys’ve—
Justin: [crosstalk] No, that was my fault.
Griffin: You guys did a cooler thing there than I had envisioned. I’m just saying, like, I get a lot of tweets now where it’s like, “Wow, Kravitz wasn’t in this episode at all, and you set up this, like, perilous situation.” It’s like, I know. Kravitz is a really great character, but this is like, me trying to reverse engineer the stuff I was gonna do in the— in the, the— the astral plane, like, into the rest of— the rest of the story. [crosstalk] So it’s not like me ignoring—
Travis: [crosstalk] If we hit— If we hit twenty thousand new and upgrading donors—
Griffin: [crosstalk] No, stop. No stop.
Travis: —then we’ll release this as a deleted scene.
Justin: [crosstalk] Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth. No. I will say— I will say one more note about Kravitz. I know people really like the Taakitz coupling, and I’m into it for sure. I think the reason— if there is, if there is one reason, and I’m reading into this from Griffin—Griffin has not presented other opportunities for Taako and Kravitz to interact—but I will say this. I have— it is zero sweat off my brow to roleplay, uh, as a male fella, and uh, going on a date with another fella. I have zero—
Griffin: Yeah—
Justin: —issue with that whatsoever. It is, however, expo-nentially more weird to go on imaginary dates with my brother.
Griffin: Yeah, it’s— [laughter]
Justin: It’s like, a lot weirder.
Griffin: I don’t wanna— I don’t wanna trivialize this, right, ‘cause I know it’s— it’s like, [crosstalk] for a lot of people—
Justin: [crosstalk] No, I’m serious about it.
Griffin: No no no, I get it. I’m just saying like, it’s also the only date that’s ever been on the show, was the— I’m pretty sure, was the Kravitz— Like the only romantic date-
Clint & Travis: Uhhhhh….
Clint: [crosstalk] Merle and the Director had a spa date.
Justin: [crosstalk] I got some heat there.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No that was more of a— more of a hang sesh. But, um—
Clint: No, no, I think it was pretty much a date.
Griffin: Uhhhhhhhhh.. Kay.
Travis: Yeah, ‘cause it’s way less weird for Dad to go on a date with Griffin.
Griffin: I don’t wanna trivialize, like,
Clint: Alright.
Griffin: I like folks shipping our characters, right, like I’m into it, um, and—
Travis: Except for Magnus. Magnus has only had one love. He’s done with that.
Griffin: Yeah, he’s done—
Clint: Magnus. [laughter]
Justin: No, Steven.
Travis: Stephen.
Griffin: Um, how ‘bout another— [crosstalk] how ‘bout another—
Travis: Well hold on, so let me answer that question. So Stefin the goldfish.
Griffin: Oh boy.
Travis: Anytime anything happens to Magnus, everyone is very concerned with Stephen. Let me- let me just say this right now- if anything were to ever happen to Stefin, I would say it. Everyone’s very concerned that something tragic has happened to Steven and we’ve just failed to mention it.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Stefin is fine. He will almost always be f— like I can’t imagine a scenario in which the payoff is gonna be something bad happening to Stefin. Steven is fine. If not— if you haven’t heard otherwise, safe to assume Steven is fine.
Griffin: Um, and, more importantly, there—there’s gonna be more Kravitz stuff real soon I promise. Hang in—hang in there, Kravitz-heads. [crosstalk] Umm...
Travis: [crosstalk] Umm... Get us...
Clint: [crosstalk] Krav-ites. {45:59}
Travis: @swiftmartyrdom asked me, ""Does Travis still have Magnus’ old backstory written down somewhere, and if so could we hear some of it?"" Here’s the thing: I wrote that backstory like, before we ever started playing, and once we actually started, this is—this is the most like, long-form improv I’ve ever done, like, years long?
And so that backstory, I don’t think— the backstory that you hear in the ""Eleventh Hour"" arc more now, like, more accurately reflects Magnus than anything I wrote a while ago. Like, it’s, it’s two different characters at this point. ‘Cause the backstory that I had was this really broken, like, bitter dude that had, like, seen some shit and was kinda forced into this heroic role, and like, it just— it is no longer representative— It was much more like Mal Reynolds? Um, but without the humor?
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Um, and the Magnus you see now is much more like the humorous side of the—
Griffin: It also, it also— It didn’t fit the— Not just Magnus’ character, but it didn’t fit the tone of the show like, [crosstalk] at all.
Travis: [crosstalk] Yep.
Griffin: It was pitch fucking black, um...
Travis: It was dark. It was very dark. And, and— I will say that the one huge element that carried over into both is, is Julia, is the wife.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: And far as a lot of people I saw talking about like, like, y’know, women dying as part of the backstory. I will say for me, for me it is the maybe the most grounded character choice I, like as far as time— Someone asked, what’s a thing I have the most, uh, Julia asked—euh, how appropriate—“What’s the biggest thing you and Magnus have in common?” {47:42} And the reason that I— I made the decision to have, uh, his wife passed away is, umm, and it might get a little serious here for a second, but for two reasons. One, our mom passed away when I was 21, and it’s, like, one of the most impactful moments in my life to date.
Griffin: Mmm.
Travis: Like, it’s like what shaped me to be the person that I am, and inspired me to, like, do more good with the time that I have left in the world. So like, that was a big part of it. And then also, my wife and being married. Um, and my wife continuously inspires me to, like, constantly be— be a better person than I was before I met her. So like, those two things is like, what for me would make someone a hero, like I kind of combined those elements in one. So like for me, everything that Magnus is, is— is from that.
Griffin: Sure. I also like, um, I— I am also kind of like— Hmm. I totally get these criticisms and there— there’s been a lot coming in, uh, coming from, uh, stemming from, uh, Episode 59 and some of the stuff that, that came in there about like, um, uh, fridging, right? That concept, that trope of, uh, fridging women characters to inspire male heroism, and, um, I— I— I definitely get that, and I think we’ve definitely stepped in it. I’ve tried so, like, I’ve— I tried so hard to sidestep some bad tropes when, like, doing this show, like— It was important for me that there was never like a, y’know, like a princess for you all to rescue?
But I— I definitely fucked up in that like, um, the— the— the— the Bury Your Gays trope with the- with the Ram and Raven, Hurley and Sloane, at the end of the ""Petals to the Metal"" arc, which, ‘cause when I was writing that, I was like, “Oh, it’s the first, like, romance in the show, and I’ll give it a tragic ending,” without knowing that there was whole fucking like— that’s how most, uh, like, gay and lesbian relationships in media end, is with tragic endings, which I didn’t realize. And so I’ve stepped in that a lot, um, in that regards, and I think we’ve— I think we’ve probably also not done so great about avoiding, um, y’know, women— women dying for dudes to have, like, the— the kickstart for their adventure?
Like we haven’t done it a lot, but maybe a little bit more than I’m comfortable with, which brings me to Lup, which I’d like to just sort of clear the air about in the next two minutes if you’ll allow me. Um, I had the idea for Taako to have this twin that he couldn’t remember? Everybody has things that they couldn’t remember because of the voidfish, um, and I had this idea for Taako to have this— this— this— twin sister Lup, um, and... The question that we got probably most in this whole thing, uh, in— in prepping for this episode was, “Is Lup’s name actually Chalupa?” {50:29} And, here’s where— here’s where I’m at. And, [various laughter] about two— about two years ago, when I—
Justin: I—I— let me clarify, I asked Griffin this exact question—
Griffin: Yep.
Justin: —as I was listening to the episode, and his exact answer to me was, “What does your heart tell you?” [Clint laughs]
Griffin: Here’s where I’m at. When Justin made Taako, when, and I— I’m guessing here, but I’m pretty sure when you came up with the name Taako, it was just, “Isn’t this a silly thing to name your fantasy wizard in our roleplaying game?” It was— it was done out of, like, irreverent silliness, right? Um—
Justin: Yes.
Griffin: It was not— it was certainly not—
Justin: It’s because naming anything like that is so whack. It’s like—
Griffin: Sure.
Justin: It’s so lame ‘cause it doesn’t exist, and it’s just like here, [in an over-the-top voice] “I’m Grendlethorn Windstilen.” Like, fuck off, his name’s Taako.
Clint: Bramblepelt!
Griffin: And at the time, like Justin wasn’t— what Justin definitely definitely definitely wasn’t doing, and I don’t think there’s been like, much criticism to this— to this um, point, Justin wasn’t making a Latinx character and naming them after a Tex-Mex dinner food, right? That would be pretty racist, pretty problematic. It was just, ""this is a silly name to name somebody."" Okay.
I— when I had this idea for a twin he could not remember, I followed the same naming convention and thought, “Well, of course his twin would also be named after a Tex-Mex food,” and so I came up with Chalupa, and shortened it to Lup so that I, y’know, could have a name that I could say that wouldn’t give away the reveal, that also sounded like a cool, actual name, right? Um, and Lup has been referenced like, a lot— pretty much most of the arcs, um, her name has been referenced.
So, fast forward to like, now, and I think we’re all a lot more cognizant about how people consume the show and how people have headcanons for... basically how every character looks, and we encourage that, right, like, I encourage that, I think it’s cool, I think it’s the coolest thing about this podcast if I’m being frank. Um, and there are a lot of people now who have this headcanon for Taako being a Latinx dude, um, thereby as an extension, his sibling would also be Latinx. And now all of a sudden, if that is your headcanon, having two... two characters named Taako and Chalupa, who, that’s how you interpret them? That sucks, right, that’s, that’s—
Travis: [crosstalk, emphatic] Sucks.
Griffin: That’s very very very problematic. And.. So now, all of a sudden, I’m, uh uh uh I, as sort of—
Travis: Just to be clear, doesn’t suck because they’re Latino, [crosstalk] sucks because of the naming thing.
Griffin: [crosstalk] No no no, it sucks because the naming— we’re all, fucking, four white dudes, and— and that— that, I think, is pretty problematic if that’s how you interpret those characters. And it does kind of create a sort of like, Schrodinger’s racism? [laughter] Where, if you interpret these characters as— if you interpret these characters as Latinx, then those names are problematic; if you don’t, then it’s just like, “Oh, what silly names.” I, as the— as the DM, and the person who came up with the name for this other character, um... can’t say, like, “Well that’s on you, if that’s how you interpret them,” and also say like, “I want everyone to interpret their characters however they want.” Y’know what I mean? So, that being said, I— I— and I don’t want folks who like— there’s been a huge amount of people who are like, “Oh, Chalupa, I figured out your name, um... Griffin you’ve been setting up this joke for such a long time,” and I think there’s people who are like, um, y’know, into the name because they don’t interpret those character in the same way.
And I don’t want those characters— I— I— I— this is not a judgement on those people or anybody, it is just like, my own sort of discomfort at this thing now, based on how a lot of people—a lot of people, because a lot of people been reaching out—um, have interpreted it. So here’s— here’s— here’s what’s up, and I can make this decision because I can do whatever the fuck I want with the characters in this world or the world itself. Lup’s name is just, I think canonically, it’s just gonna be just Lup, right? That’s what we’ve been callin’ her, and um, I think that’s like the best way to kinda move forward. I think— I think— uhh, no I need to be a little bit more steadfast here.
Clint: Spell it L-O-O-P.
Griffin: No, Lup’s name is L-U-P, it’s how we spelled it, and it’s just— it’s not short for anything, Lup’s name is just— is just Lup, and I— that’s— that’s the end of the story. Because there’s so much more— there’s more stuff I’m doin’ with Lup, like a lot, a lot more stuff I’m doing with Lup, and I don’t— I don’t know. I don’t want anybody to listen to this podcast and be uh— uh— uncomfortable because of some racist un— undertones that were completely—
Justin: [crosstalk] Unintentional—
Griffin: Completely and totally unintentional, um, like I don’t— it— it is important for me that- that nobody sort of has that. And it’s way more important to me than, like, landing some two-year-old stupid pun, right?
Justin: Pseudo-joke.
Griffin: Pseudo, kind of lazy joke.
Justin: {55:23} Dad, I have a question here from Alison Wilgus. Uh, it says, “Has working on the graphic novel script and revisiting early episodes while adapting them affected how you feel about TAZ as a player?”
Clint: Um, it— oh, as a player it’s made me appreciate A) Griffin’s storytelling, Griffin’s worldbuilding—
Griffin: Thanks daddy!
Clint: Um, because really and truly by about the third or fourth story, it was obvious that— well even before that, that— that you had gone off the rails and started working on your own thing. Um, and it has— it has affected me in the fact that, it— when I realized that, it kinda made me realize that I had to up my game a little bit? And it, it’s sorta like what Justin touched on before, um, y’know, we... Y’know, when people are asking about do we do things that push Griffin’s buttons on purpose? Yeah, we do that, but do we do things to try to derail the story, no, we don’t. Um, in— in— uh— I’m bein’ honest here, I really think that we become actors?
And I— and I think we really try very hard to balance out like the riffs, y’know, like the meta kinda stuff and the current references and the pop culture references, with bein’— tryin’ to be pure to our character. And, honest to God, we really didn’t have characters until, I think, like the second arc? Maybe the third arc? For me, I think, a big moment was Merle getting his arm chopped off. That made me kinda realize that it was, it was real, and, y’know, this was— this was kinda y’know, full fledged character building.
And, y’know, that’s informed a lot of the things that have happened since then, uh, Merle’s attitude towards Magnus, a little bit, in kind of a fun way. But um, going back and re-doing the graphic novel— I mean adapting the graphic novel has just kinda re-impressed me all along, ‘cause man, I’m tellin’ ya, there’s a lot of jokes, but there’s a lot of heart—
Griffin: [crosstalk] A lot of heart.
Clint: And I think that’s what— that didn’t start showin’ until later, I think. We had a few flashes of it early on, but I think that’s when—
Justin: [crosstalk] Well—
Clint: —it became kinda special.
Justin: I think we didn’t know that we had— that the show had the capability for that—
Travis & Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: —early on.
Travis: I agree.
Justin: We didn’t— It wasn’t in our—
Clint: It was a joke fest.
Justin: Yeah, and it— We didn’t know that it had— Like, we didn’t— It’s like a car that flew [Griffin laughs] all of a sudden, it’s like, wait a minute, can we really—
Griffin: [crosstalk] That is such a good way of— cause I— I see—
Justin: [crosstalk] —we built— we built this to—
Travis: [triple crosstalk combo] We Grease-ending-ed it really bad. Like, the ending of Grease, like, wait what? Are— are they dead? What’s going on?
Griffin: I see folks recommending this show to other folks on Twitter all the time and it, uh, they say like, “You gotta listen to this show, like, it- the story goes some places,” and I see a lot of people say like it emotionally affects them and “Oh man, I cried so much during this episode,” um, and then somebody actually, and then— I see somebody say, “Oh, I’m gonna start listening to The Adventure Zone,” and then like, uh, a day later it’s like, “I just hit this point in The Adventure Zone where one of them murdered somebody and asked why they got a boner, like are you sure [laughter] this is the same one?” Um, I have a question—
Justin: [crosstalk] Uh—
Griffin: —here for all of you and it’s from @lilybesidetherocks who says, um, {58:54} “What are each of your favorite musical pieces Griffin has produced for the show?” Hmm, yes tell. [crosstalk] What are they?
Travis: I will say— I really really like, um— I just like the whole soundscape of the, uh, of ""Petals to the Metal"", but for me, I just really love the music Griffin made for this year’s bonus Adventure Zone Knights. I know you said you cranked it out in thirty minutes—
Griffin: [crosstalk] It’s a banger. No, it rocks.
Travis: It’s just really good.
Justin: Um, I like the Crystal Kingdom song. I think it’s the best— I find it very, like, to hear it later— I find it— I find it very—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Well that’s ‘cause you—
Justin: Like, chilling—
Griffin: You’ve got a lot of ASMR, like, stuff going on, and so I made that— Y’know, I thought that might be it—
Justin: Yeah, my brother can’t give me ASMR. I’m a normal person. [crosstalk] Like, that’s ridiculous.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Okay. [snorts]
Justin: I’m immune to your— your ASMR charms.
Clint: ""Arms Outstretched""—
Griffin: Oh!
Clint: I think the music that—that—that— you had in there— that was pretty cool.
Griffin: Well thank— well thank you. I—I—I— [crosstalk] I asked this to you guys as a joke—
Travis: [crosstalk] You don’t get to talk, we talked about your stuff.
Justin: Let Griffin talk about the favorite piece of music that’s he’s written [crosstalk] himself.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Nooo...
Clint: For himself.
Griffin: I wanted to say for um— one of the like most interesting things about doing the music is I did like a mostly like, western sort of acoustic soundtrack for, uh, ""The Eleventh Hour"", right? And I got a lot of people saying like, “Wow, it’s cool that you’re sampling Bastion,” which is a really fucking great, um, uh... What would you say, like, twin stick RPG, sort of—
Travis: Mm hmm.
Griffin: —thing? Maybe not twin stick, that’s not the right word for it, but. Um, and a lot of people were like, “Wow, you sampled Bastion a lot,” and as the arc went on, more and more people were like, “Okay wow, you’re sampling Bastion in like, every song.” And I realized it’s because both me and the composer for the soundtrack for Bastion used like, a bunch of Soundcloud— Er, not Soundcloud, uh— uh— GarageBand, which is the software I use, uh, we used the same, like, pool of loops.
So this is— I wanted to clear the air about that, because I also saw a lot of questions about, like, uh, me— me— me yoinking Bastion’s stuff, and it’s like, well, I promise I wasn’t like, “Oh, I’m gonna take this from the Bastion soundtrack"", um, it’s just we— we took from the same pool of loops. Because there’s stuff like slide guitars in Roswell’s theme? Um, like, I don’t own a slide guitar or know how to play it, so I used loops and it was just the same one that they used in Bastion.
{61:05}
Travis: Uh, we had a question from Felix, and I think we can answer this pretty quick. “Any chance we could see y’all playing some female or gender-nonconforming characters in future iterations of TAZ?” And I do wanna say, if you haven’t listened, uh, to the Adventure Zone Knights yet, you should.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: Justin plays, uh, as a tiefling monk who, uh, I believe identifies as female, [crosstalk] uh, named Troth.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Um, yes, Troth kicks ass. I—I—I—I think this is important, right? Like, I talked about, like, I want there to be good representation on this show, um, and... I just would wanna make sure that, like— I wanna make sure we do a good job of it, if we do it as player characters. Like I’m not, like— I wouldn’t be afraid, right, to play a woman or uh, a non-binary or non-gender-conforming character, um, I just would wanna make sure that, like, I don’t know, I did a good job and I didn’t fall into any [crosstalk] pitfalls.
Justin: [crosstalk] Remember when we just talked about how we made one stupid naming decision and it haunted us for [crosstalk] three years?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Justin: Like, we’re— it’s hard y’all.
Griffin: It’s hard but I can’t—
Travis: [crosstalk] But— but— but to answer your question, yes.
Griffin: Yeah. We’ll— we’ll do it.
Travis: We want to make great, interesting characters, and like, so, the answer is yes, but I don’t ever wanna do it as a stunt. I don’t ever wanna do it because like, “Hey, uh— hey fandom, do ya like this?” I always want it to be because it’s the right thing for the character, the right thing for the story, and the right for, for us and the audience, y’know what I mean?
Griffin: Yeah. It’s tricky— it— It’s a tricky balance, but it’s something that we’ll definitely, uh, focus on.
Travis: Uh, Griffin, I have a question for you that a lot of people asked, I don’t know the answer to, which is—
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: —you talk about in, um, Episode 59, like— Well, two questions. One, so Magnus has the new body, right?
Griffin: Yep.
Travis: And the physical stuff that he lost during [crosstalk] Wonderland is back—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Oh, does he still— Does he remember Kalen?
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: No, no no no. I— you— so the way that I kind of thought about this, and you all— this is what fucked me up when you guys were like, “Oh, don’t get back in your body, you’ll forget everything,” is we were kinda thinking about it in a different way, in that I was thinking that like, your memories and the things that you remember kinda resided in your spirit? Or whatever?
That was inside of the mannequin, and so when it was outside of your body you were technically dead, and so the voidfish didn’t work on you, and that’s why you were remembering those visions and all that shit. But like, I think your memory lived in your spirit, so when it got back in your body, just because your body was from a time before Wonderland, like your brain would still remember Kalen? That’s not really how I think about it. I— uh— and frankly like—
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: —that moment was too cool to take away. So like no, Magnus doesn’t remember Kalen, ‘cause I do kind of like this idea of Merle and Taako having to go on this vengeance quest for this dude they’ve never met before. That we may not— which may not happen, but just like, I’m not gonna take that away.
Justin: [crosstalk] So, I’m gonna— I’m gonna call it right— I’m gonna call it right now, we’re gonna have— At some point, we’re gonna do a live show, and it’s gonna be a two-night— hunt— the hunt for Governor Kalen.
Clint: [crosstalk] Oh, man!
Travis: [crosstalk] I’ll play— I’ll play as Kalen.
Clint: Oh, that’s excellent.
Justin: [crosstalk] Stunt spec— stunt spectacular.
Clint: Like a Rogue One spin-off, okay.
Travis: And for those- for those of you asking: K-A-L-E-N. Kalen.
Griffin: It’s not— I don’t think you meant to do it like Kalan, like Elliott Kalan from— [while Griffin is talking, Justin is making noises]
Travis: No, he’s named after Elliott Kalan. He’s named after Elliott Kalan. It’s just spelled differently.
Griffin: Oh great. [laughter] Um, hey folks, I’m gonna—
Justin: [crosstalk] Um, he’s named after Deus (?)—
Travis: [crosstalk] I’m sorry, there was one other important question Griffin.
Griffin: Yeah.
Travis: {64:15} Why was Garfield growing Magnus’ body? And I bring this up—
Griffin: I will never— I will take that to my fucking grave.
Travis: [crosstalk] I do wanna say—
Justin: [crosstalk] Is there a reason?
Clint: [also talking at the same time] But there is a reason.
Travis: —when we did the InterroBang live show here in Cincinnati in February, a— a— someone came up to me and was talking to me about Adventure Zone, and, this was after Magnus was in the mannequin, and they said, “Y’know, Garfield has been collecting these things, maybe he’s growing a body.” And I was like, “Holy shit that’s amazing,” and I said, “If that turns out to be the case, I’ll remember and thank you,” and I cannot [crosstalk] remember his name.
Griffin: [crosstalk] You did not do that. Oops.
Travis: And so, I am saying now, I was inspired to like, pursue that, [crosstalk] that was a joint collabo.
Griffin: [crosstalk] By that person.
Travis: —if you’re listening, please tell me it was you so I can thank you officially.
Griffin: Um, I’ll never say, I think it’s too, like— Garfield is such a nebulous, fascinating character to me, and... So much so that people do not know if he is... a cat or not. [laughter] Um, and so—
Justin: But that’s another great ex— that’s another great example of a character that was like, was a punchline, and then, just by necessity we started to hang other things on.
Griffin: But that’s The Adventure Zone, [crosstalk] that’s— that’s like why Daven— Davenport is the captain of fantasy NASA, apparently.
Justin: [crosstalk] But it’s like… yeah, right.
Griffin: Like, that’s— that’s what I’ve kind of been— that’s been the big payoffs, that’s why Barry Bluejeans is fucking alive again, like yeah, that’s, that's— And I don’t do that s— don’t do that stuff purely as jokes or whatever, but it’s a— certainly a— certainly a benefit. But like no, I’m not gonna tell you why Garfield was growing an extra Magnus body, um, he was a fairly evil warlock/mercantile-warlock guy? So like maybe figure it out, but like I—I— to me, leaving that a mystery is fucking hysterical, and I’ll never ever ever ever say.
Travis: Alright.
Justin: Um, we’re gonna— we’re gonna talk about the future of TAZ, but real quick, I wanna— We wanna make one last push for the MaxFun Drive. Maximumfun.org/donate is the— is the address you can go to, um, and if you enjoy this show, and I know a lot of you do... Um, it would really mean the world if you could kick in just five bucks a month. If you, if you like this show, and you want to like, help keep this and other stuff we do rolling, and, um, make it easier for us to make this stuff consistently, um, it really is the—the—the best way to do it.
We only do this once a year, and we come to you and say, ""hey, please, if you can help out, if you can— if you can— if we all pitch in a little bit, then it makes it so much easier, and it—and it let’s us create stuff, um, and it really— it means a lot."" For just five bucks a month, you’re gonna get days upon days of bonus content. If you can kick us ten bucks a month, you get all that plus, um, a pin, based on whatever show that, that you, you like the best. For twenty bucks a month, you get the pin, you get the bonus content, and you get a really cool ""keep in touch"" kit, um with all the stuff Travis listed before. But—but—but really, it’s just the act of, um, like, this network isn’t founded on, uh, a few hundred to two hundred dollar-a-month donors.
We certainly appreciate the people who are able to do that. But what it is built on, the strength of this network, is the multitudes of five and ten dollar and twenty dollar donors, like that— like that is what— and thirty-five dollar donors, like that is what the—the—the network is, is founded on, and it really is thanks to you that we’re able to make the stuff and we— we appreciate it so much, and if you haven’t taken to, and y’know, we’re— we’re down to the final days of the drive, so please, please please please, maximumfun.org/donate, and— and kick us a few bucks. It really would mean the world.
Griffin: Um, yeah. I don’t— I don’t really know what else to say. Um, your— The, the support the show’s gotten has changed my life, and, uh, it’s— This is like the first piece of fiction that I’ve ever done, and that like all of us collaboratively have ever done, and your response to it has been incredible, and the support that we got, um, in the last couple MaxFun Drives has been like, overwhelming, and just— just thank you so much! If you enjoy the show and you spend time with it and you have the means, just think about donating. Uh—
Travis: maximumfun.org/donate.
Griffin: Alley-oop. There it was. There was that slam dunk. {68:40} Um, let’s talk about what’s next. ‘Cause I can— I can say, um—
Travis: We’re gonna end the show. Bye!
Griffin: Yeah, bye! No, we, um...
Clint: Tell ‘em you’re joking, Trav.
Travis: No, it’s true. Thank you for all your support, it really means— but two more episodes and we’re out. [crosstalk] No no no no no. No no no.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Then we’re out. Take the money and run. [sings] Hoo hoo hoo! So, next in Adventure Zone is gonna be a sort of special thing? Um... For like in this campaign, it’s gonna be kind of a special thing that gets the— What I referenced at the end of the last episode, “The Stolen Century” is gonna be the name of it, and we’re gonna dive in. And we’re gonna answer basically every question up to this point, and my hope is that—
Clint: Except about Garfield.
Griffin: Except about Garfield and his— his— his purposes. Um, and my hope is that by the end of that, we will basically be at the starting line of the finale, which will definitely definitely take more than one episode to get through. Um, so, that’s sorta the road map for the rest of this campaign.
Travis: The Balance Arc. The Balance—
Griffin: The— The Bureau of Balance, Grand Relic saga. The Grand Relic— I—
Justin: It’s called the Balance— It’s called the Balance Arc. We came up with that whole kitschy name for it.
Travis: Balance Arc.
Justin: The Balance Arc.
Griffin: Balance. Okay. Um, after that, we’re gonna, uh— We’re gonna be transparent here, because we’ve kinda struggled with this a lot, um, because this show does have a pretty big following now and a very passionate following, and.. We struggle with this idea of doing something new and pulling the rug out from under people and the transition— no matter what we do, moving from this thing that a lot of people are really really passionate about to something new, even if that new thing is great or better— It will be a rough transition. And so we’ve struggled a lot with, like, the best way to do it, um, a way that will make the transition easiest for the listeners, but also will result in us starting in on the coolest and best imaginable thing that we could do... next. So...
Travis: And if— Let me, let me also say this. Just ‘cause I think this is— maybe this goes without saying, but I do wanna just reiterate, no matter what we do after this, it does not erase the, like, sixty-some, seventy possibly episodes of the Balance Arc. Like, that will be a thing that exists, you know what I mean? [crosstalk] It will always be there for you to go back to.
Griffin: [crosstalk] In fact, I— My, my desire to wrap up this arc and have it be done is, well, twofold. First of all, I think it would be— I think we’d eventually— it’d be shitty eventually, like, eventually if we kept doing Taako, Merle, and Magnus, it would be— it would be bad. I need— I need like— we need to be able to— to close this thing out, but also like, I love the idea of just like closing it out and there it is, it’s done.
This thing that the four of us made over the course of almost three years that like we can all be really proud of, here it is, it’s done, it’s got a nice little bow on it. There it is. That’s it. Um, so next u— what we’re doing next, I will say, we don’t have set in stone, um. Some— some— I—I—I—I think we’re just gonna try some stuff out for a little while, um- Travis has sort of brought up the idea of like doing some mini— mini stuff, some one-shots, um, [crosstalk] which will take a little while.
Travis: [crosstalk] Well yeah, so basically like, what I suggested was like, you know, we’ve talked about it before of like us all taking turns, y'know, GM-ing something, um, and, so like— Different mechanics, different settings, different stories, you know, one or two episode arcs of just like, ""here’s what Justin’s vision of this would be, here’s what Dad’s vision, here’s what mine"", that kinda thing where we try different stuff out instead of just trying to jump [crosstalk] head-first—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Travis: —into like another big arc, um... Having little, you know, little excursions into— into different worlds.
Griffin: Un— Until we find what the next thing is— Like, what the next thing that makes sense, I—I, um— I have a few ideas— And then once we get, like, once we find our footing, and we feel really confident about it, and think we have something that folks are really gonna like, then we start in on the next big arc. And I think the next big arc probably won’t be as long as ""Balance"", it’s not gonna be two and a half years. I— I hope—
Justin: Yeah, I that we- we made a tactical error— Not a tactical error, but it’s like, figuring out as we go along. This show is always intended— Well, not always intended, it wasn’t always intended to be fucking anything.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: But to be a consistently produced thing, this show needed to be able to evolve beyond individual story lines, and individual specific games.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Um, and— and it will do that, uh, we’re still going to be telling stories, and hopefully we’ll be better at it [crosstalk] from the jump than trying to back into it.
Griffin: [crosstalk] We’ll be way better at it! Yeah.
Justin: Dad, you’re looking at me furtively. [crosstalk] What do— what do you think—
Clint: [crosstalk] No, no no!
Justin: No, no— I don’t know what the word furtive means. But you’re just looking [crosstalk] at me thoughtfully.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Not what you thought it means.
Clint: [crosstalk] I am, I am—
Justin: [at the same time as Clint] I was just wondering if you had some thoughts.
Clint: I was just gonna say that, you know, Merle, Taako, Magnus, and—
Griffin: Everyone.
Clint: —Griffin, the DM, will continue in other forms. [crosstalk] I mean we got—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, so—
Clint: We got the graphic novel that’s gonna be coming out.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: We have the bedsheet sets that we’re working on, so— [laughter]
Griffin: Well, the big— the big thing that’s gonna be—
Justin: Spaceballs the cereal, Spaceballs the toilet brand.
Griffin: The big thing that’s gonna be germane to you, the listener, is— One thing we’ve talked about is just— Liveshows? Still gonna be Tres Horny Boys. Because I- I don’t know what the— we don’t know what the next shit’s gonna be, and so the idea of just like, once Tres Horny Boys’ thing is over—I don’t know if the next thing’s gonna be good for live shows. This thing— This thing is, but I— We don’t know. But this is one way we can keep their thing going with little side stories and— and stuff like that. Um, so, I think liveshows, we can still— we can still do ""Balance"".
One thing that I kinda wanna do is move away from D&D? Which I think is— I know there’s a lot of folks who play a lot of tabletop games who are kinda, um, uh, hard on D&D? Like very negative about it. Um, I still think it’s a great game, I just don’t know if it’s suited for our purposes really well. Like case in point— if you’re a magic user, there’s almost always a billion things you can do, and so most the stuff I edit out of the show is, um, Dad or Justin—and this is not a knock against them, um, ‘cause if we were just playing around a table it would not be a big deal, but because it’s an audio medium where there’s other people listening it is a big deal—uh, like trying to figure out what to do next because they have this huge multitude of options, um, and so like— I wanna move to something that’s more rules-light and more—and not to say that like, uh, D&D can’t be a narrative-heavy game—but something that is sort of more designed around that? Uh, and I’m gonna reference [crosstalk] Friends at—
Travis: [crosstalk] And we’ve already been playing this version of D&D as rules-light as we possibly could.
Griffin: Yeah, and we— I—I—I—I get a lot of flack from people just like, well that’s not how that works, there’s a lot of people who are very angry that I say the word bluff check instead of deception check, and it’s- first of all, I’m sorry, that’s what they call it in 4th Edition, get out of my butt, um. [Travis laughs]
Griffin: But like I— I just, I feel like something that is more rules-light where you guys can do things and interpret things using a smaller set of rules will be like, way way way better for us.
Justin: And it may actually make us adhere more—
Griffin: Yeah, sure!
Justin: Because there is that like issue of slippage, where…
Griffin: Yes.
Clint: Yeah.
Justin: You know, I’m not gonna talk about the material— I referenced— [Justin chuckles] I referenced material components for one of my spells once when it was a [crosstalk] cool thing to do.
Griffin: [crosstalk] And that was that. I’m gonna reference Friends at the—
Justin: And spell casting time.
Griffin: I’m gonna reference Friends at the Table here again because they, um, they— they use rule systems, uh, that are, uh— it’s a system kinda like how, uh, D&D is a- uh, part of the d20 system. There’s a system called Powered by the Apocalypse that I really like! It’s all, like— you just roll 2d6 and, and that determines fucking everything, and there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of games covering hundreds of different genres that like, I’m— I’m looking at that, like that could be— I don’t want to chomp their flavor but like I that is— it’s just better, like, it’s a better— it is a better, like, format for a— a narrative-heavy, like, game-light, actual play podcast.
And I don’t wanna like, um, I think, uh— I think Critical Role plays, uh, either D&D or Pathfinder, like, um— Like I’m not dragging actual play shows that do D&D because they’re fucking super super good. I just think as, as— the more we go along, the more D&D stuff I ignore, and I don’t know that we’re doing ourselves a, a service.
Clint: But let’s be honest, we’ll always have a debt to D&D.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure!
Clint: That’s what started TAZ.
Griffin: I think it’s a good first game to play, definitely, and for— it’s a fun game like, as a game... like a tabletop game, it’s just like— it’s not— I don’t think so suited to the way that we do the radio show.
Travis: And I also think it’s— it’s— I think it’s like just like these characters, just like Griffin said at the beginning, if we kept playing D&D, there’s other options out there, and like this is our D&D arc with [crosstalk] Merle, Magnus, and Taako.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Travis: [crosstalk] And I mean like that’s—
Griffin: [crosstalk] So, specifics—
Clint: Do we— do we wanna toss out—?
Griffin: Yeah, so—
Clint: A couple of the genre ideas we’ve had?
Griffin: Yes. So, I—I— Dad, why don’t you tell them yours, ‘cause I— I’ve been— I’m excited about it.
Clint: Well I’ve got an idea to do a superhero story. And it’s a— it’s actually the basic framework of the story is based on a comic book premise that I sold years and years and years ago that just never came to print, and I’m—
Griffin: Is it Freejack?
Clint: —really— Uh, no?
Griffin: Can [crosstalk] I say that?
Clint: [crosstalk] No, that’s not the three— it’s not the 3 Ninjas Kick Back either!
Griffin: Did you ghostwrite both of those?
Clint: Uh— I don’t illustrate any of them I wrote ‘em.
Justin: [crosstalk] Ghostwrite.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Ghostwrite it.
Clint: No I didn’t ghostwrite ‘em, I got— I actually got credit for that.
Griffin: I thought you ghostwrote Freejack.
Clint: Uh, the first issue with Chuck Dixon I did.
Travis: [interrupting] This is so not what this is about!
Griffin: Alright, fine.
Clint: But anyway I’m lookin’ at a superhero setting. Um, and, just a— That’s kinda the idea I’ve been kickin’ around.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’ve got a— yeah, go ahead.
Travis: [crosstalk] Um for— for mine— What I’m kinda lookin’ at is kinda inspired by ""The Eleventh Hour"", I would like to do kind of like an old west, uh, RPG? Um, and— and kinda focused on—More on like an old west, like, actual, you know, real world old west setting, so I’m gonna try to find a mechanic that works for that and write a story. People have asked about Adventure Zone Knights, if that would expand. I think that would be tricky, ‘cause there’s so much info that exists for donors only, but also like I just didn’t— I didn’t create it for an arc, I created it as a [crosstalk] one-off stories.
Griffin: [crosstalk] As like a one-shot, yeah.
Travis: So, maybe—
Griffin: I have an- I have an idea for a, um...like a Persona and Buffy-inspired, um, RPG about, uh— uh, like, um... sort of unsuccessful West Virginia ski resort town that monsters start attacking? [Justin laughs]
Griffin: And I also have an idea for a Cowboy Bebop and Battlestar Galactica-inspired, like, post-apocalyptic hip jazzy space opera.
Justin: I have an idea that— It is like a Sherlock Holmes, and we’re all Sherlock Holmeses, and we find different clues that are better than the other ones— [Laughing and slow clapping]
Justin: And it’s like, “But wait, you missed this!” And that’s like the whole thing is like, four, super smart Sherlock Holmeses— [Clint laughs and Justin breaks off giggling]
Justin: And also one of us is a vampire, but are we good enough detectives to figure which one it is? [All crosstalk with Justin]
Clint: Aaahh!
Griffin: Oh shit.
Travis: Oooo!
Clint: [crosstalk] Yeah, tell us about it.
Griffin: [crosstalk] I don’t know if— I don’t know if you’re joking but I wanna play that super bad. [Clint laughs]
Travis: Uh, so—
Justin: I’m obviously joking. We need to wrap up so bad.
Clint: [voice imitation] ""Keep your feet on the ground—!""
Justin: No, hold on—
Griffin: Hold on, hold on, we need to say some stuff! We can’t just say the fucking outro! [Everybody laughs]
Travis: Yes, so as is clear, we are still kind of like, nailing it down, but that gives you kinda like a basic idea. The show will not stop.
Griffin: No.
Travis: When the arc is done.
Griffin: It’s too much fun.
Travis: And there will be— there will be some, like, you know, finding our feet and everything. And—once again, as has been up to this point, the deal with Adventure Zone—audience feedback and you guys buying in is going to kind of shape the way it goes. But that’s where we’re at.
Justin: To be clear, that— We didn’t mention those to like, put— This is not up for a vote.
Travis: No.
Justin: We’ll pick something that works and do it, but we of course want to hear from you— after we’re making the things.
Griffin: Yeah, and— And again, it’s a bi-weekly show, so it’s gonna take us a— It’s probably gonna take us a while, before we get onto the next big big arc, but I promise you, it’s gonna be fuckin’— I’m really looking forward to it. It is going to be so much fun to make new characters and explore new worlds and new genres and all that s— Like, I think it’s gonna be— I think it’s gonna be incredible. And I think the next thing we do, like I’m already— I’m already excited for it. So we hope you can get on board.
Clint: And we love Merle, Magnus, and Taako, we really and truly do and we kn— appreciate you lovin’ them, but I— Let me be the dad, and let me just say: just trust us.
Griffin: Just trust us! [crosstalk] It’s gonna be good!
Clint: [crosstalk] You’ve trusted us before—you trusted us before, keep trustin’ us.
Travis: Um, we also hope that you’ll consider donating to the Maximum Fun Drive, maximumfun.org/donate, support the art and artists you love, and then let us know. Um, but you’ve heard us talk enough about that, I think it’s time for us to wrap up. [crosstalk] I think— I don’t know how we end this, but thank you all for listening.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yep. Thank you all for listening, thank you to John Roderick— no, thank you to Mort Garson, and just Mort Garson for the theme song ""Déjà Vu "" off the album Ataraxia. Um, that’s it! Thanks for listening to The Adventure Zone— The The Adventure Zone Zone, rather, and we’ll be back with a new episode next Thursday— uh, which is April... the... sixth, and... yeah. It’s gonna be big! Thanks for— thanks for comin’ along!
Travis: Alright Dad, now hit it.
Clint: Okay— [voice imitation] [crosstalk] So keep it real everybody, thanks for bein’ here!
Griffin: [crosstalk] I’m hanging up.
Travis: [crosstalk] Nope. Bye!

Travis: [in a soothing commercial voice] This episode of The The Adventure Zone Zone brought to you by Dove Soap. Dove: Love the skin you’re in.
Justin: [in a very game-show-host voice] Hello, everybody, and welcome to The Adventure Zone Zone!
Clint: How come I can’t do that voice?
Justin: Can you just let me fucking do the intro?
Clint: Sure, fine.
Travis: Guests of The The Adventure Zone Zone stay at their respective houses.
Griffin: The The Adventure Zone Zone is also sponsored by Viking Cruises, I'm Laura Dern, and have been the whole time.
Justin: Winners of the The The Adventure Zone Zone are going to space camp.
Travis: [loud gasp] Really?
Justin: The Adventure Zone Zone is filmed at Buena Vista Studios, Buena Vista, California.
Griffin: Um. Hey—what are we doing here? [crosstalk]
Justin: This is The Adventure Zone Zo—
Travis: Right now, funny jokes.
Justin: You’re not letting me fucking host, I’m hosting it. This is the— [laughs] it’s such a good name— The The Adventure Zone Zone, a podcast about a podcast called The Adventure Zone that we all made together, and we still do, but different. Um, my name is Justin McElroy, I play the character of Taako on The Adventure Zone: Balance.
Travis: I’m— I’m Travis McElroy, I played Magnus. Justin do you think there are people who are listening to this episode who don’t already know that?
Griffin: [laughing]
Justin: It's a weird place to start, y’all.
Griffin: I’m Griffin McElroy, I did every— all the other characters.
Clint: I’m Clint McElroy and I played Merle Hightower. The—
Justin: Nope.
Travis: Nope.
Griffin: I love it.
Travis: God.
Clint: Highchurch. Highchurch.
Justin: Are you fucking shitting me?
Clint: That was the… An incredible— Probably the best loved character of the entire—
Justin: Best loved, least remembered in terms of last names.
Clint: Well— I— the fans remember me.
Justin: If on the odd chance you are starting this like, this is going to be completely a spoilering thing for the previous arc of our show, Balance, which now at the end of it I wish we had called it bonds, but I think balance is fine.
Travis: [crosstalk] Okay.
Griffin: Well it’s too late, I wish you’d said something earlier.
Justin: I wish I had, it occurred to me as I was listening to the finale for the umteenth time. But uh—
Griffin: Can everybody si—I just heard two different phone notifications go off—
Justin: [crosstalk] It’s dad, it’s dad. He’s always got his shit cranked. And I don’t--
Clint: I tried to turn it off! [unintelligible crosstalk] {0:02:54}
Travis: Everybody’s hitting him up now like, hey I heard you on Adventure Zone Balance, will you come on my thing and forget how to play a game on my show. Everybody wants dad to come on and forget how to do stuff on their show now.
Griffin: [crosstalk] So hot right now.
Justin: Griffin.
Griffin: Yes?
Justin: I want to start out with like a general question— and we’ve got a bunch of questions from listeners but I wanna ask some of our own questions.
Griffin: Yeah I think that’d be good if we started out by just sorta— if you all have questions for me, now that the campaign’s done, and y’all know everything.
Justin: I’m curious if you can- and I know that this stuff is always sort of like— what’s wrong dad?
Clint: I don’t know why this is still makin’ sounds.
Justin: The iPad?
Clint: Yeah!
Justin: Okay. Give me your iPad.
Travis: You can turn it off.
Justin: I’m gonna— no I’m gonna sit on it until it breaks like I’m a gorilla. No you— okay that’s muted it shouldn’t be doing this.
Clint: Yeah I know! You heard it!
Griffin: [crosstalk] This is a good show.
Travis: [crosstalk] God, this is top notch.
Justin: So, Griffin can you describe to me, in an abbreviated form I guess, how the like, in what order the certain main keystones of the story sort of came to you?
Griffin Yeah.
Justin: Like what the inception of it was, and how it sort of built over time in your head?
Griffin: So like in all— it started with The Lost Mines of Phandelver book that comes with the starter kit— the fifth edition starter kit. Um which is really— which is really great I really enjoyed um when I was in town for— when we were making the TV show, um Justin ran a quick game for us — for me and the Smirls, and we all played basically the same adventure and so Justin got an idea of like, the other ways that it coulda gone cause there’s a lot of other stuff in that book that I kind of condensed and fast-forwarded through so— cause by like episode two really like I knew I wanted to move on to original stuff.
Um, and by the time we reached the end of, uh, Here There be Gerblins I had a— uh an outline for like what the structure of the story was, I— I’ve talked about how like, it had a very video gamey structure of you all getting the seven, you know, goals. There — it’s gotta be seven always every time. Uh, they could have been fuckin power pendants they could have been magic crystals or whatever but this time they were the Grand Relics. Um and—
Travis: Griffin, can I ask, cause this is something I always want to ask people who like, run shows like this, at that point how far ahead did you know like did you have a concept for the finale, did you know like what characters would end up being a much bigger part of it?
Griffin: Um— no. There’s a— and I don’t want to give away too much cause there— we’re gonna be, like, diving, there’s a lot of very very granular, very specific questions about stuff like this— um, but the answer is, I had the very, very, very loose structure of the campaign in mind, I had, like, all of the Bureau of Balance stuff figured out, um... but the arcs, like, I figured out what the next arc was going to be while we were doing the previous arc.
And really I think by the time we got to Crystal Kingdom I kind of realised, like, okay, the rubber really needs to meet the road here and I need to start setting up sort of the bigger picture stuff, and that’s why we got a lot of, uh, a lot of stuff in— it’s funny, if you go back and listen to Gerblins, and you go back and listen to Rockport Limited, those were both I think good little self-contained things that ultimately, like, have very little bearing on the rest of the campaign at large.
When we meet the Red Robe at the end of Petals to the Metal, like, that was the first sort of hint that I was giving, like, okay, there is a bigger thing going on here, and then in Crystal Kingdom it was, like, that was me setting up the, you know, the planar system stuff and the, uh, multiverse stuff and more Red Robes stuff and yeah. Um, that’s where you all got the patches, which sets up the IPRE, like, so by I think by Crystal Kingdom I had— I pretty much knew what was going on, I knew that you all were the Red Robes, I knew that, um, I— I knew a lot of that stuff. But it really took—
Justin: [crosstalk] Sorry, go ahead.
Griffin: But, uh, I, it— but it really took, like, a lot of playing to, like, get to that point, to like know what the— what the story was gonna be.
Justin: Do you remember— for me, so much of the story sort of hinges on the Voidfish. Do you remember when the idea of the Voidfish came to you and, like, what problem that was trying to solve?
Griffin: Um... I mean, partially, I think when it started it was, uh, solving for the structure of it, right, of you all trying to get these very very powerful relics and the question would’ve been, like, if these relics exist why isn’t everybody trying to get at them all the time? Why wouldn’t your characters know about them already, if these, like, seven immensely powerful objects existed in the world and you all were adventurers and these things were capable of, like, mass destruction, how would you not know about their usage up to this point?
Um, and so it was a— kind of started as a way to, like, introduce this thing in a way where your characters wouldn’t have known about it. But obviously, like, what the Voidfish was after I’d introduced it like that, I realised it could, it could mean, like, a whole lot more and we could, you know, introduce a lot of different narrative stuff involving, like, you all having other memories that were suppressed, and— yeah. So, so, so the Voidfish became a, a much bigger thing; I think when we meet Lucas, and uh, I think like Lucas and Johann have a scene with the Voidfish, that is kind of where I started to, like, figure out, like, okay, no the Voidfish is, is a bigger, is a much, much bigger thing here.
Travis: And is that where you decided you would kill Johann and make everyone sad, or did that just come later cause you were just feeling really bloodthirsty, or...?
Griffin: Um, I mean, I can talk about that, like, Johann’s whole deal— that was one of, in my mind, like, one of the bigger themes of the show, is like, um...uh, how people respond to the idea of— how people respond to the fact that, like, you aren’t always going to be here and that the works that you create and the things that you do outlive you. And so Johann—
Travis: Legacy.
Griffin: Yeah, a legacy. Like, so Johann was, like, a big thing there, right, like a lot of the conversations you had was, like, him talking about, like, oh, well, I wanna be a great musician but I’ll never be remembered because of this— um, and when I first heard “Voidfish (Plural)”, the track from, um, Rachel Rose Mitchell, that we used in the penultimate episode— when I actually heard that song, that firmed up in my mind what that, what those moments were going to be, what that payoff was going to be, and I really liked the idea of just, like, Johann’s work not only, like, outliving him but being fucking broadcast to every person across all of the planes. I thought that that was, like, a really, uh, cool moment, and so like that’s kind of when that firmed up.
Justin: Was— was Johann— okay, was the voice at the beginning of every episode supposed to be Johann?
Griffin: No. Okay, so this was also a question that we got, um... the voice at the beginning— and I don’t, I don’t know if I did a great job setting this up, and maybe I should just leave it a little bit more obscure, but the voice in my— in my mind was the story. Of the Story and Song, that was being sent out— that was being, like, broadcast by I guess Junior. I guess the voice was Junior, right? Cause Fisher put out the song and Junior put out the story, and so I— I thought it would be cool if the podcast was kind of the story, in a way, and you were hearing everything, um, that Junior knew about this world and the events that happened in it. Um, and so, like, that’s why in the finale there is no—
Clint: You don’t hear from it, yeah.
Griffin: You don’t hear the deep voice in the finale, because they say at the— in the penultimate episode, like, that’s all I know, it’s, you’re all caught up, that’s everything that I know, let’s find out what happens together. And then the finale is, like, all of us seeing what happens together.
It’s no longer the story being told by Junior, it’s just, like, the thing. I really— I dig that shit in basically all forms of media, this idea of just, um, uh, like, meta, meta narrative, and, like, the things that you are experiencing in whatever it is— the game, the movie, the book, whatever— is part of a character inside of the work transmitting it in a way. Um, the Zero Escape games do that in a way that I think is, like, really cool, and so, like, I kinda wanted to take a stab at that.
Justin: Um, I’m gonna— we got more questions for Griffin, obviously, and I’m sure we’ll have some organically that come up, but uh— uh, since we could bloviate about our own bullshit for hours on end, I’m gonna try to keep this on the rails a little bit with another question from a listener that’s directed to everybody: “You all mentioned”— and not Griffin, so get bent— uh, “You all mentioned you cried during the finale: which specific moment made you emotional enough to cry?” And I will direct this at Father first.
Clint: Oh. Um, I, uh— [laughing] this sounds— I don’t wanna sound self-serving— okay. I—
Travis: Dad, we’re literally doing a show talking about our own show.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, we are serving ourselves in a major way.
Clint: [crosstalk] I guess we’re supposed to be self-serving.
Travis: [crosstalk] I don’t think you gotta worry about that. Like, if you start talking about your favourite episode of Battlestar Galactica, I think that’d be way weirder.
Clint: Oh, man, the one where, uh...
Travis: Nope.
Clint: Starbuck— okay. Um, if it’s about the finale, the one time I can remember crying was, um... was Merle’s last scene with, uh— stop looking at me, Juice— Merle’s last scene with Mavis, when, uh, she talked about how proud she was of how well he was doing, and he said “I love you, baby”, because that was— that was kinda me telling you guys the same thing.
Travis: Gross.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yeah. What a nerd. [Griffin laughing]
Clint: Uh, it— yeah, it is gross. But— ‘cause I was, I was so proud to be part of it, and, you know, and so— yeah, so— and I cried every time Tom Bodett died, how’s that?
Travis[?]: [crosstalk] That’s fair.
Justin: [crosstalk] You’re out. Travis, go.
Griffin: Then you cried zero times, cause I don’t think he ever did.
Justin: Travis, bare your soul!
Travis: Um, so, for me— I think this will not come as a surprise to anyone who listened to it, but basically, like, every—
Griffin: The last 20 minutes!
Travis: Yeah, everything that happened in the wrap-up, um... but, uh— I, I based a lot of Magnus’ backstory and motivation and stuff on— oh, not to get too super-real for a moment— we lost our mom, uh, when I was 21, so I based a lot of, like, his motivation to do good on that. Um, and so the moment where Magnus says to Julia that he just tried to make her proud of him is from a very personal place for me, and how I live my life day-to-day, so, like, that— and I think also just getting, just having a resolution to the story of Magnus was very very fulfilling for me because I really liked, um, over the course of so many episodes and so many years, having the chance to kind of unfold it as we went, and the fact that you really didn’t get a lot of his backstory until, like, I think the fourth arc, I think until Eleventh Hour? Maybe?
Griffin: Yeah, in the flashback temptation episode.
Travis: Yeah. And so, like, getting to, like, slowly kind of build to that moment and getting to have an actual cap on it was both emotional for the character, but also very satisfying for me as the creator of Magnus. And, just— it was a— it was a relief to have that moment, so that.
Griffin: Juice, did you—
Clint: I wanna— I wanna add one quick— lemme add one quick thing before we— your mom’s fingerprints are all over this story.
Griffin: Absolutely, yeah.
Clint: And I wanna tell everybody— the whole “choose joy” attitude, that was Leslie McElroy. I mean, that was— that was her defining personality trait, and, you know, we— that rings out through, I think, the whole series. And, uh, so, she—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Certainly in, like, most of Merle’s, like, serious interactions with people—
Clint: Yeah.
Griffin: Of which there were, like, a lot, in the back half of the podcast. Juice, did you get weepy in the— I was— I edited it, obviously, but you know, I didn’t hear any, like, deep Travis sobs.
Justin: Uh, no, no sobbing. I’m thirty-six, so, okay. No, um—
Griffin: Okay. You fucking tweeted a whole thing about how crying is good, and [crosstalk] now you’re puttin’ everybody on blast.
Justin: [crosstalk] {00:15:38} Yeah, I— no, I’m not trying to put everybody on blast. You know what got to me, I— okay. I didn’t feel that way while we were recording, because the— that part of my, I couldn’t— mm. I felt like I couldn’t let myself get that, sort of, emotionally, um— I— there’s just too much going on in my brain, show-wise.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: But, like, relistening, um, especially the parts— I’ll tell you the parts that hit me is the parts that we didn’t hear— but we would relisten. I had a, um— this is kind of weird, but, uh— when new Adventure Zone episodes come out, I will often, like, sneak into a Rabbit stream, or a Discord—
Griffin: [clearly grinning] I did that in the finale and I totally ghosted, I did not announce that I was there, and I know it’s a creepy thing, but I— I really wanted to know what it was like to see people listen to it for the first time.
Justin: Right, and I did that, I listened to the end of the penultimate episode, and I— I mean, I cried, and I cheered, and, like, fist up in the air, like, yelling. Like, I was, like, so jized[sic] {00:16:44}. And we hadn’t heard that part during the show, the part about Johann, “you’re going to fight”— uh, “you’re going to have to fight and you’re going to win”, and, like, I just found that so, um, inspirational, and sort of like, uh— I don’t know, like, a very good antidote for a lot of the messages of the world at that time, which is this time, now.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Uh, and I— and I found that— and, and that actually leads me to a question, Griffin, like, um, did—
Griffin: Well, I wanted— I wanted to mention real quick, I had a—
Justin: Oh.
Griffin: I had a moment, and I don’t think it kinda came through, but I was getting really choked up and it was really really hard for me to keep talking, um, and for me that moment was, Travis had just said in Thieves’ Cant to Carey, “Are you ready?” and Carey gestures back “I’m ready”. And then I go into, like, the description of the wedding, which was really really really important to me. And not only that, I knew that was it, that was the last monologue.
You guys were done talking, the game was— this was it, this was the last thing. And for me it had nothing to do with, like, what was happening in the narrative, as much as it had to do with, like, when I said “I’m ready”, I was literally saying was, like, I am, I’m ready to send this story, that we’ve all worked on, and is so so so so so special to me, I’m ready to, like, send it off. And so that whole last monologue, I was— I was fighting off tears the whole time.
Travis: Can I also, to that point, I do also wanna say— so during Magnus’ send-off is, you know, when I was, like, crying. But my favourite kind of emotional payoff for me, just in, like, the more organic collaborative storytelling, is the fact that Magnus got to have, like, a best friend.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure.
Travis: Like, I— I loved everything with Taako and Merle, but that was, like, a relationship unto itself. But, like, the fact that we got to build, really organically, a relationship that was just like a very interesting friendship between Carey and Magnus, made me so happy, that’s— that kind of thing in media, when you get to see people become friends, is way more interesting to me than any, like, romantic storyline in a TV show or movie, is watching two people you would never expect to be friends become friends.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, and that’s— that’s tough, that’s, like, difficult to pull off. Like, romance is tough to pull off, and obviously, like, this was— this was all our first stabs at, like, making fiction in this way, and so, like, that was something I was nervous about, you know, delivering on some different romance threads, but like I— and I, I really love that stuff, but, like, I— I really loved, like, uh, Taako and Angus’, you know, friendship and mentorship, and Taako and Joaquin’s friendship, and, uh, Magnus and Carey, and John and Merle, holy shit, like, all of that— all of those, like, relationships that started from zero and then, you know, turned into something else I thought was, like, really good.
Justin: It’s— it’s kinda interesting to me that a show that is made by a family is not— is more, is much much much much much more about found families—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yep.
Travis: [crosstalk] Mm hmm.
Justin: —than it is about family literally. I mean, even— if you think about it, even the family that is our literal blood had to be found in the story, you know, it wasn’t inbuilt in the characters.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: But like, I think that there is something so moving about people choosing to be family—
Griffin: Right.
Justin: — that I think is really powerful and beautiful. Okay, listen, we’re— we’re, like, almost 20 minutes in and we’ve gotten one listener question, so we need to speed things up.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, let’s— let’s crank through ‘em.
Justin: [crosstalk] I need brevity in your answers. Griffin, how soon did you know you were going to bring back Barry Bluejeans?
Griffin: Um, so obviously I- obviously I knew by seven birds, right, end of Crystal Kingdom at that point when I said who the seven birds were gonna be, I knew I knew who they all were. Right, Lup, Davenport, uh Lucretia, Barry and the three of you. Um, so probably— it was probably during Crystal Kingdom. During Crystal Kingdom again like I mentioned was the time where I was like, okay I need to figure out what the bigger thing is, how it's gonna wrap up, and I need to start setting down breadcrumbs to get us there. And so uh probably around then. I said a lotta stuff like Barry’s dead, uh I think I did actually at one point say Barry’s never ever coming back which was—
Justin: Yes you did, you lied about uh—
Griffin: —that was the only lie, right? And I'm sorry I did that. But the rest of the time I tried to be coy about it like, yeah Barry’s— Barry’s dead. He is dead, he’s a lich. [audibly smiling] But whatever.
Justin: Uh, Travis—
Griffin: [crosstalk] By the way, and the boys can attest to this. That episode I think was like 58? Where I brought Barry back I was so scared. Like I— I wanted that payoff to be so good and you guys can hear it in my voice. I remember like we had to stop a couple times during that bit while we were like getting to the end of like the Wonderland stuff. I was like okay gimme a minute because I needed to like collect myself because I really really really wanted that to— to land.
Clint: And now that we know that he listens, you’re welcome Tom Arnold.
Griffin: Holy shit.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yes you’re welcome.
Griffin: Yeah that’s been a —
Clint: For bringing back your career.
Justin: [crosstalk] uh yeah—
Travis: [crosstalk] woah
Griffin: I don’t know about that…
Justin: Also thank you for The Stupids, it's a great movie.
Clint: It is!
Justin: Uh, uh, sniper— I should mention Kate was the one who asked that question, I don’t think I got that in.
Travis: Yeah also also Aquafourchette asked the one about crying.
Justin: okay, uh Sniperjoe(SP) asked: Travis, did you consider calling on Julia during the fight with final John.
Griffin: Holy shit did people in the live feed that I was watching—
Justin: [crosstalk] Oh they were so ready for it.
Travis: Well so here’s the—here’s the thing. To that point I have always envisioned, and people have asked about this. I do envision Julia being uh a very—
Griffin: [crosstalk] A badass
Travis: —competent—
Griffin: Yeah
Travis: Being a badass. People have talked about like did they fight side by side in the battle— yeah! Duh! But I think um in that moment honest to god it never crossed my mind because that would be… not the right moment for that to happen. Um—
Griffin: Yeah as somebody who like, thought about who you all might summon with the bonds, I thought that there was a chance that it would happen and we could do the— we could do the reunion there right? And Julia would do like some cool stuff because I’m fuckin all about um, women having power and agency in this world, obviously. Um for—for me I thought it could go either way. If you did it we could— we could uh I— I do not think it would have been— It would not have been difficult to find a way for her to have like some powerful effect right? Um, I have—
Justin: It would have removed a lot of the power from the ending, though.
Griffin: I think it would have— I think it would have been— I think it would have taken away something from the reunion at the end of the episode so that— that was the tradeoff. Like we could either do it then and have like a cool reunion thing there and like a cool moment of— of Julia doing some badass stuff, and then maybe the ending wouldn’t hit quite as hard as I think it absolutely did thanks to that incredible song by Reeder um, the song just called Julia. Which by the way that was a tricky thing to include in the show and attribute without giving the moment away. Um or— or we could just like— you could just not do it and we do have that sort of powerful—
Travis: Well to— to the thing uh the convention of the bond summons was tricky because I was still trying to play strategically while also thinking story wise. So like, I will say that as far as did I consider um, it really didn't occur to me because just from a storytelling perspective that was not the right time for that reunion. Like it just— we wouldn’t have felt— it would have felt forced.
Justin: And I bet at least subconsciously you had faith that Griffin was going to resolve—
Travis: 100%, yeah.
Justin: Yeah. Okay here’s a question from Eva (sp) uh— uh somebody’s got that highlighted and I can’t— okay. It was me. Uh, Dad, did Merle ever try to resolve things with Hecuba?
Clint: No! I don't think so. I really don’t.
Travis: Merle’s estranged wife.
Justin: Okay.
Clint: Here's the thing, one of the—one of the things we tried to show in the like the second half of the whole arc was that Merle was trying to be a better dad. But Merle was a horrible husband.
Griffin: Yeah.
Clint: It was better to try to forge something new with his kids—uh and by the way thanks to the one person who pointed out that— that uh Mavis was actually his step daughter.
Griffin: Yeah, yeah.
Clint: And Mookie was his child.
Griffin: Right.
Clint: And that he was— but he was still trying to be a dad to both of them and that was— that— I think we both— well I don’t know about Griffin, but that happened kind of spur of the moment but I— you know— I think we needed a father’s perspective somewhere in there.
Justin: It was— it was so weird how many things in the show are spur of the moment things and uh there was a lot of things— and this is a weird— I've never experienced this in other creative works but a lot of times I opened my mouth on this show and my thought was “I hope this is true”. Because like that— that— that— a lot of the stuff, especially early on we were just saying whatever dumb shit came to our heads. And we never really stopped that impulse, we just have like more footing? And like, I had to have a lot of faith in them but also myself that like, the things that I’m saying are— I hope the things that I’m saying are true.
Griffin: But they— they always were and that’s one of the things that I think was great about the story we told was like, it always was true. You said it, it was true, that’s kind of how D&D works.
Justin: Right, but at the same time true to the narrative of what we were making and true to game. And also you have to remember like, I’ve been in Taako’s skin for 3 years so like there’s stuff that I hope it’s true to, like, the beginning of the story and the things he has said you know. And it’s impossible to have a canonical sort of like understanding of everything he has said at every point in the story um. But there were times when we couldn’t do— I’ll highlight one example that I can think of. When we were supposed to, what looked like, turn on the Bureau of Balance.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, god that was such a tricky episode.
Justin: It was really hard because—
Clint: And you and I, the thing— background: Justin and I record in the same room.
Justin: Right.
Clint: And so you know, we don’t make a lotta eye contact or anything like that, but I think we were—
Travis: [crosstalk] Just in life they— they never look at— it's very— [unintelligible crosstalk] {0:27:18}
Clint: Well we don’t look at people. But that was a very weird moment, because I— you know I felt like we were being lead in one direction but it just didn’t feel right.
Justin: And we had to stop and tell Griffin like, hey I understand the story needs to go here but you’re going to have to give us—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah
Justin: —something more because we don’t feel it.
Griffin: That moment was kind of like, a lot of my fears as DM and like, storyteller for this podcast kind of realized in that I kind of understood like, I— I have not set this up maybe enough. I do not know that I have necessarily earned this thing. Because ultimately I wasn’t asking you to turn on the Bureau of Balance and Lucretia and like, betray them and if you thought in that moment that like, Lucretia was gonna be the final boss or whatever I could understand your trepidation because I didn’t—I— we definitely didn’t earn that. I was trying to set up kind of a different thing of just like, I want you all to investigate this thing a little bit deeper. But I think I made it feel like the other thing just because I didn’t necessarily set that up. Um— [crosstalk] enough
Travis: [crosstalk] Well and— [unintelligible] {0:28:19:}
Travis: It— that’s why it was so interesting just from my point of view of like taking Magnus, who was maybe the most lawful good of the three of them, and then investing like, starting I think in Eleventh Hour like, nope you’re a Red Robe and there’s a whole bunch of shit you don’t know about, and you have to break your own rules to figure it out and—
Griffin: That— that was super hard it— to just to complicate things even further because Magnus I think did have that. Magnus did have that context, Magnus did want to investigate and Taako and Merle did not. And I think that lead to some interesting friction. And ultimately I love the way that it turned out because what happened was, especially with Taako, Taako’s reasoning didn’t turn to alright let’s fuckin— I— I don’t— his thing wasn’t “okay I don’t trust the Bureau of Balance, let’s find out what’s going on"".
Taako turned to “I don’t trust anyone” and that was such an interesting character thing to then work back from in the finale. And I think it made— if you think about all that stuff happening in the same day I think it makes a lot of the moments in the finale like a lot more powerful and Taako goes from like, “fuck everything”, to “I’m going to save everything”. Like it’s— I think it was good payoff.
Justin: Um, the— and then also it— moments like that are why the accusations that I sometimes see on Reddit um, what’s up Reddit, of like railroading from Griffin ring hollow because we could not be railroaded into something we didn’t want to do— I mean like—
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah.
Justin: We create collaboratively and with guidance from Griffin, like but if it's something that like, didn’t make sense for our characters or the story we just wouldn’t fucking do it.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: Um, while we’re talking about Reddit, um, a lot of people talk about Homestuck all the time. I don’t know what that is. And there are— people have basically said this is just like Homestuck, this is directly lifted from Homestuck. I have no fucking clue what Homestuck is!
Griffin: I know some of— I know a little bit. I read like a little bit of the beginning of Homestuck and I—
Justin: [crosstalk] Do not @ me!
Griffin: —Well I thought I understood what it was, but then I read like a wiki roundup of what it is, and it’s like oh no it’s completely different from what it was. But as far as I can tell it is also like a, uh, a piece of fiction that dealt a lot with like alternate reality stuff and multi—multiverse stuff. And—
Travis: [crosstalk, sarcastic] And it was the first piece of media to ever do that.
Griffin: Well, no but it—I think it was a very popular piece of media that did that for a web audience that has a lot of crossover between ours and—and their audience’s. Also it apparently ends with a um, a lesbian wedding between two characters, like that is also the ending of it. So like okay yeah, I guess there are some parallels. But there were a lot of people— I really— this stuff does not bother me at all 'cause it’s— I— every time we would put out a new episode it was like oh did you take that from um, when we did the robot kingdom Stolen Century episode people were like ""Ooh, somebody’s been playing Nier: Automata"", and that’s like, I haven’t played it yet. But—
Justin: And that’s not to say like— and that’s not to try like, I know we probably sound defensive at this point but it’s really, because there are many things that it’s like, oh was that like— okay uh, when I called my assistant uh, on the show um, on Sizzle It Up With Taako when I decided his name was Sazed, that’s because I was reading—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, straight up.
Justin: —The Mistborn Series at the time. And that was a character that I really liked from that show, and I was like ah yeah here’s a little something for you, so yeah. I do do that sometimes— just not in this exact instance—
Griffin: We’re really— but I— I’m not defensive about it at all— at all because I can’t be defensive about it because I did pull a lot of inspiration from a lot of different things when we were making the story. Um, and I—I tried to be really forthcoming when we talk about that stuff, right? Like Crystal Kingdom was inspired by— I was getting into the Alien series, and so I wanted to make sort of a sci-fi uh, you know, monster hunt kind of thing.
And uh, Petals to the Metal was all Fast and the Furious because I just gotten into that series when we were watching that. So like it—it really doesn’t bother me. There are a ton of parallels as far as I can tell between Adventure Zone and Homestuck but like, I just have not uh, I— it was not a— as an enormous inspiration as I think people thought it was just because I, um, it sounds really cool and I know some—some cool folks who have worked on it but I uh, I just— I don’t know that much about it.
Clint: I think it’ll be connected to this, can we read— can we do the question from Gull, Gullshreik?
Griffin: Uhh, yeah we can bounce around this list, I don’t see why, we don’t need to—
Justin: Was there anything that was discussed for story or character development that happened in advance?
Clint: Okay, never. Right?
Griffin: Yeah, never. It—you’re talking about like, did we have a call when we were not recording and we were like okay well what if—no.
Clint: No— no we did not, we— and i’ve seen that a couple of different times, and I think that is also ties in with what you were talking about before, because we did not discuss what was coming. If it ever happened it was in the vaguest of generalities where Griffin would say uhh you’re gonna have to make some tough choices, or something you know along those lines.
Travis: Well there was stuff like, like the items that we crafted, right? During Stolen Century where Griffin would send us the mechanic and say like, think about what you like or—
Clint: Right.
Griffin: But never story stuff because—
Travis: [crosstalk] or something along the lines of like—
Griffin:— I— I cannot stress this enough. Nobody knew the things that I had planned. Like, Rachel didn’t know. Like, I didn’t tell Rachel. I didn’t tell you guys, I didn’t tell anybody. Um which I talked about in the last one was like a really isolating thing that I kind of struggled with, because um, I had no idea whether or not this stuff was going to pay off like I thought it would in my mind, but I really wanted those moments where it’s like, hey Magnus you’re a red robe, hey Taako you’ve got a twin sister.
And that— that led to some I think we were figuring it out on the fly how to respond to that stuff. I know when we started Stolen Century like, Justin actually had some struggles with the fact that there was this major character in his life that I had sort of kept hidden this— this whole time and, how do I like, all of a sudden since we’re in the past, like, have this character be very very important to me when I know virtually nothing about them by virtue of like how it was in the show—
Justin: [crosstalk] Well, and it was also— it was also this feeling of like, I have envisioned an entire life for this character but if I had kinda had my head on a bit more of a swivel, I would have realized that like that is exactly what Taako went through. I mean it’s exactly what— Taako had his reality shattered by this realization—
Griffin:[crosstalk] It was— it was so important to me not to take that away from Taako, and we straight up, when we recorded the first episode of Stolen Century, when we were about five minutes in, we had to stop and we talked for maybe a half hour. This is maybe the most of um— this is maybe the most— this thing that you asked about. Um, where we stopped for a half hour, we stopped recording and we just like, hashed it out.
Because I super didn’t want to take away Taako’s like, independence and Taako’s um, you know backstory of just like you know sort of— fighting for every scrap he could get his hands on because it informs so much about Taako, and I think you thought by me introducing Lup, that I had taken all that away. And there were a lot of people who were super critical of—of the fact that I had done that, who thought the same thing. And I can’t stress enough like, that was not my intention and I don’t think that’s what introducing Lup did, it was just like you both went through this stuff and you both—
Justin: [crosstalk] Well, and now I don’t— also a little worried that it’s like, well now we have two Taako’s which— but at the same time— but as we got to know her obviously Lup is very different from Taako which is very cool— and that leads us excellently into this question from Laura Kate Dale. {0:35:31} Uh, at what point in developing the show, Griffin, did you decide to have Lup be a trans character and how did feedback end up? I loved her.
Griffin: Um, so pretty early on, I— I knew that Lup was going to be a uh, a trans character um, and—
Travis: What— can I ask a preface to it? When did you know Lup was going to exist? That— I’m curious about that. When did you decide Taako would have a sister?
Griffin: Yeah, I guess I can talk about that first, like a lot of people were like, well did you know when Taako took the umbrella from the red robe that it was Lup, and the answer was like, no, not at that point I didn’t. I knew that character was a Red Robe, and all of the pieces kind of came together when I figured out who it would be, and I matched up the fact that like, Lup made the Phoenix Fire Gauntlet so that’s why she was there. Um, and that answered a lot of questions about that.
I don’t- when Lup— when I figured out Lup was gonna exist again I think it was about Crystal Kingdom when I figured out who all the red robes were gonna be. As— as for Lup being a trans woman, I knew pretty early on, um, I kind of struggled with it because I wanted to— it was really important to me that I tried to do a good job of that. And because I know that that particular form of representation uh, is— there have been a lot of examples of that sort of not— not being so great, and I did not want to be just another sort of bullet point on a very long list of— of you know bad trans representation in fiction.
Um, and I get kind of uncomfortable being honest— if I’m being honest like talking about this because it is a thing that I um, stressed out about, because there’s— I— a lot of that comes from the fact that this is our first time doing fiction so like making good characters of any sort of uh, type are— is a tricky thing um, and I’m uncomfortable with the idea of like saying like yeah we— we crushed it! Um, the— so Travis actually put out a tweet saying like we wanna have you know, trans characters on the show uh, will you please message us and tell us like, what is important to you in how we handle that.
Um, and we got a shit ton of feedback and Travis shared that with me, and I went through all of it, and it was all super super helpful. Um, I read a few uh, things uh, online from uh some trans authors who were talking about like, here’s how to have a good trans character on the show, here’s like a bunch of shitty pitfalls to avoid. Um, and so I tried to be like, really really really thoughtful about that stuff in, uh creating Lup. And then also like, everything I did as Lup I tried to view it through that like particular lens so that I could try to do as good a job um, sort of realizing her as I possibly could.
And the feedback was really really good, I think like, across the board the feedback was great, and Lup is one of people’s like, favorite characters. Um, and so like, I feel really good about how it turned out. Um, if only because like, I know that I was trying to be as thoughtful as I possibly could in including this character whose life experience is completely different from my own which is always like a really really tricky thing in— when you’re doing fiction.
Travis: And I would also like to say just to sum up the— the bulk of the responses we got ahead of time when we asked like, hey we’re gonna introduce this character and we need your input, we need thoughts, was pretty much like, introduce her like you would any other character, because uh, and let character develop over time um, just like you would any other character. And you know when we introduce, you know, Johann, we don’t sit there and give you uh, a bullet point checklist of his you know, of his sexuality and his background and his gender, we just introduce the character and then you get to learn about them over time.
Griffin: I don’t want it to sound like this was like, so hard, right? Because it really wasn’t, like once Lup was in the story and I knew uh, I— like I had an idea of who she was, it wasn’t— it wasn’t that difficult. It was just something that I tried to be mindful of, um you know, whenever I was playing as Lup, when I was inhabiting uh, Lup. It really wasn’t difficult but I— I just really — I— God guys I just really didn’t wanna fuck it up. I super didn’t want to fuck it up.
Travis: It was so interesting to have a character that in my character’s mind had not existed for the first like six or five arcs or whatever, and then suddenly in the Stolen Century was such an important guiding force that suddenly— like— kind of retroactively informed character dynamic and story in such an interesting way. All of them, I mean—
Clint: [crosstalk] And relationships, too.
Travis: Yeah.
Clint: And existing relationships.
Travis: I felt that way about Lucretia and Davenport and Barry and Lup of suddenly like, oh okay.
Justin: It all does start to make a lot more sense, it’s funny how it colors retroactively that fact that like, these three idiots made it as far as they did.
Travis: Mm-hm.
Justin: And what you learn from like, Stolen Century is, it’s because they had these other like, what you were seeing in the first five arcs, or six arcs I guess, is really an incomplete picture of like, three sort of like— the dullest knives in the— in the IPRE drawer. Um, trying to like muddle through on their own. And when you see how much better they are when surrounded by competent people. I— I do wanna say though, and this is something that like we’ve talked about privately, and I— I don’t have a good answer for it and I wish I did. But I think it’s important to show that we’re like— I think it’s important to not try to pretend like we have all the answers.
We’re about to head in to much— a few much shorter arcs and something that I love about the Adventure Zone is that we— it has always had so many different points of view in terms of gender and sexuality and— and so many different perspectives from those characters. And we’re back to it— but like— for Taako it took me a long time before I was like, sort of comfortable enough being Taako to like deal with those parts of his life because it’s not my own experience and I wanted to do a good job of it. And I’ve talked about the struggles in previous uh, TTAZZs, but um, I don’t have a good answer for how we do that in shorter stories and still do really well by it.
Griffin: Right.
Justin: And I don’t have a good— I wish I did but like I don’t want it to feel like such a drive-by that it’s like, just sort of checking boxes you know.
Travis: Yeah.
Justin: But I also don’t want it to be, just four straight white dudes—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, it’s—
Justin: —Being four straight white dudes. I really don’t— we don’t have good—a good answer for that.
Griffin: I think the— I think the short answer is like it—this is something that is important to us and is also something that I recognize will be a little bit trickier to um develop out in a much much shorter format which is what we’re gonna be doing for a little while here um once we get past the live shows that we kinda have in the can already. Um, but like it is something that is important to us moving forward and I think was an important part of this word, and is—is absolutely um something that is—is going to be present in the future of Adventure Zone stories.
Travis: I— I hope the character creation is more streamlined. I think like that’s what we’re bringing to it now is the character and you know, we often reference that I wrote this huge backstory for Magnus and I did but that was all like, you know, big epic story but still it took a long time to figure out what he was like in conversation, how he felt about, you know, walking into a room, like, what did he, you know, uh, does he have a sense of humor? Is he funny? Is he snarky? Is he boring? Is he you know, all that stuff happened as we were playing it.
Clint: And TAZ: Knights is what I was thinking of as an example ‘cos I think we, we rolled up new characters and while they weren’t— you don’t want ‘em to be too well defined ‘cos then you have no journey to take.
Justin & Griffin: [crosstalk] Sure.
Clint: You gotta a story to take but I— you know I really liked those three characters and I liked the dynamic that came about from it.
Griffin: But— But on that— on that subject though like, I don’t know that in TAZ: Knights like, we got this idea of having like a bunch of representative characters just because like, we didn’t have a lotta time to work with and like Justin said it’s not something that I want to feel um, forced ever like we absolutely want to include uh, characters that—that represent you know different folks but like —it— that is a tricky thing to do— representative fiction in general is a really really difficult thing.
Like that conversation is very uh, it’s very fraught and it is really difficult to parse. There’s like this conversation about the—d—deciding between you know, having representative characters or just speaking your own voice. And uh, I—I think it’s really really difficult to do good—good representative characters but it’s also really important because if we just spoke our voice then all of our campaign would be like four cishet white dudes and I— I can— I can’t imagine that. Like I can’t imagine that being the truth. We’re— we’re bloviating a lot but like, this— this— we’re gonna keep— we’re gonna keep you know trying to make a uh, a very inclusive world and do a better job of that.
Um specifically about race, like this was something that we have talked about before, like, we were not mindful of this at all when we started doing the podcast, because it was not a thing that we knew to be mindful about. We did not know that this show would mean this particular thing to folks and so when we started it was just like, you know, I’m an elf. And that was like pretty much the extent of it. And now I think we know uh, a lot more and hopefully moving on to uh, future arcs we will be sort of better at this.
Travis: I have a quick question— I think Griffin could probably answer this one a lot faster. This is from Jeeves Bunny and I also have been very curious about this. In a past The The Adventure Zone Zone Griffin mentioned a dark timeline for if Magnus had been tempted by the Temporal Chalice. What had been planned for that?
Griffin: Oh okay so let me think. If—if— I thought Magnus was the only one that would maybe take the offer um, from the Temporal Chalice at the end of The Eleventh Hour Arc, and so he was the only one that I kind of did plan like a dark timeline thing for. Um, but basically my idea was that we would then just like sort of hop onto a recording just me and Travis and record a little bit of like what life in this world, this happier world would be like?
And then eventually Taako and Merle and Lucretia and whoever else would, by some magic or maybe Lucas technology cross over into this world fuckin ""Turn Left"" style, from that really great Doctor Who episode, and either convince Magnus that what he has done to their world is wrong and terrible and also in that sort of uh, timeline convergence I don’t think Taako and Merle would know Magnus and so that would have been very difficult and—
Justin: [crosstalk] Fffuuuck I’m glad we didn’t have to thread this (...?) {00:47:34}
Clint: [crosstalk] Hoo…
Griffin: and then either like, Magnus would have to give up on this world which I think would be a tough putt, or... Merle and Taako and Lucretia would have to get that fuckin cup back. And I—this—
Travis: [crosstalk] Y’all are welcome.
Griffin: I fully, fully expected Magnus to take it. Like I had prepped a lot for this. I thought Magnus was gonna take it and I thought that, it was going to lead to some pretty dark stuff and I thought Magnus was dead. I thought Magnus was gone.
Clint: And you can hear in Griffin’s voice I think, the— a little bit of surprise when he— when he didn’t.
Justin: It’s um— it’s um— lets see—
Travis: That’s ‘cos I’m the best [laughing]
Clint: You’re the best.
Justin:[crosstalk] Travis rules.
Griffin: What was the other thing like this that we could talk about? Um—
Travis: Uh —that— it so the next question from Ella: What was going to happen if the gang hadn’t gotten Magnus’s spirit back before it was sucked into the Astral Plane during The Suffering Game.
Clint: Well we can answer— well I have an answer for this that also— at least would answer—
Griffin: [crosstalk] How do you have an answer for this?
Clint: Well, because— well not exactly. Casper Marie wanted to know what were the line/moments that have stuck with you the most, and that is one of mine. The uh, Arms Outstretched—
Griffin:[crosstalk] Arms Outstretched, yeah.
Clint: Arms Outstretched, to me, was— that was another time where I got teared up because we— just the reaction and everybody working together and the unity of it. And I— Griffin and I, we have never talked about this but I got the impression that that one came outta left field for you.
Griffin: Yeah it absolutely did. And I think that there was this— the reason for me that moment was so powerful was because I think we all had this dawning realization that the three of you were… not going to do what— what I had planned. Like all— all of us were like slowly realizing like okay this thing is about to change because of your agency. Because of your power in this world—
Clint: [crosstalk] And not just in the “lets fuck Griffin over like we have in the past.”
Griffin: No no no, it absolutely wasn’t coming from like a mischievous place—
Clint: [crosstalk] uh uh
Griffin: — it was just like no, you know what? Fuck this. And I’m going to save my friend. And I think that that was really cool. To answer the question of like what would have happened in the Spirit World: I had this idea of like a simultaneous across two planes sort of fight that would happen where um, Merle and Taako would be taking on Magnus’s body with um Edward inside of it, and Lydia’s lich form while at the same time Magnus and Kravitz would be sort of fighting against the Hunger in the Astral Plane. Um, and we would get a lot of—
Travis: [crosstalk] I—I- ugh [wistfully, like he wished that had happened]
Griffin: We would get a bunch of development there about sort of, uh— because at that point Magnus would be dead so there would be more uh— there would be of a— an easier way for me to roll out the like, returning memories because the Voidfish doesn’t effect dead people and also sort of fleshing out Kravitz a little bit more, and also fleshing out the Hunger a little bit more.
Travis: [crosstalk] Everyone’s gonna be so sad.
Griffin: Well no no no—
Travis: Including myself. I would have loved to seen a fight with like Magnus and Kravitz like back to back fighting. Oh god it would have been badass.
Griffin: [crosstalk] It would have been— don’t get me wrong it would have been really really cool. I would not trade in the Arms Outstretched moment for anything.
Clint: [crosstalk] Nope, nope.
Griffin: For anything. And I know there’s a lot of people who are gonna go online and be like oh Travis why did you do that. I would beg you not to do that because for me Arms Outstretched established a tone that would literally carry the rest of the show through the finale. The rest of the show would not have been what it was, because I reworked some stuff after Arms Outstretched. The rest of the show would not have been what it was without that moment. It was too powerful.
Justin: Well, and it— I think Arms Outstretched was also one of the moments where I let— let it— [sighs] There seems to be— if you look at Taako broadly speaking, like holistically, it might seem like there’s inconsistencies um, in his self-serving attitude and the… sort of strength of his connections to people. And I hope that it came across how— the extent to which it was a put-on. I mean like, you could listen to what he says about being self-serving and certainly some of his actions early on like, not going into the bubble city, stuff like that, the Taako’s good out here stuff, like, would certainly seem to reinforce that.
But like, he does for— he is hungry for connection and he does want— and he is like— you have to remember that like, even if he says like this is a— this is um, you know he’s in it for himself or whatever, these two other guys are literally at that point in the story the only thing he had in the world. Like obviously he had a connection with Kravitz.
Griffin: For sure.
Justin: And like, um. Anyway, that’s Taako.
Griffin: So that was— that was a question we got from a lotta people. I wanna do real quick a speed round and I think we could answer a bunch of questions that compromise maybe 95% of the questions that we received.
Justin: [crosstalk] Yes.
Griffin: Um, we got a lot of questions that sort of asked us to add to the lore of the world or add to the canon of the story, and I’m really hesitant to do that for so many reasons. Like the largest of which being that I like that the story is done, and the story is a contained thing that we can point back to and so I don’t want— I don’t want this episode to be like “oh you gotta listen to The The Adventure Zone Zone if you want the full picture”.
Um, I also want like— there’s a lot of stuff that kind of popped up in the fandom of uh, of— of fanon and there’s a lot of sort of like, debate about that, inside of certain communities that I, like, I don’t know as much about and so I do not want to stumble into it and like, make it big thing. Um, but I think that there is some stuff that we can kind of clear up really quickly and answer some of the more common questions that we got. The first of which being: Travis, is Steven okay?
Travis: Griffin, did you not edit into the episode like I told you to?
Griffin: Oh no, I forgot, yeah.
Travis: I literally said, I texted Griffin “oh no, I forgot to mention Steven, I’m going to be tweeted about this forever.”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah.
Travis: And Griffin responded “I will edit something into the episode about it”
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, I forgot, sorry
Travis: And then you did not UGHHH. Steven is okay.
Griffin: Okay great. Um was Angus—
Travis: [crosstalk] Griffin, did Steven pass away and move to the— the Astral Plane?
Griffin: Yeah I think you had Steven in the Astral Plane, for eternity.
Justin: [crosstalk] That must have been quite the shock for Julia I assume. What the fuck is this?
Griffin: Yeah. It’s a fish.
Justin: What is this now that’s in my house?
Griffin: Um, was— was— I know what I said about fanon and not wanting to step into it, but I have to address this: Was Angus a silver dragon the whole time? That was maybe my favorite fan theory—
Travis: [crosstalk] I never heard this!
Griffin: It came out of the— so— the idea was that like, Angus was— we never found out about Angus’s parents and there was like— there was a lot of jokey joke stuff about like, him being super super powerful in uh, the train arc, and him being like, there’s some reference to him being ageless or something like that, and he also had a hoard, right? He had a hoard of silverware. And so people wanted to know if Angus was a silver dragon the whole time. Um, I dunno, I’m actually gonna leave this one [giggles] unanswered.
Justin: Griffin, Griffin wanted to read your question but not answer it. Griffin—
Griffin: It was— it was— this was not something that I thought of, but I think it’s such— I dunno I like the idea of it a lot and so I’m gonna leave that one blank. Uh, was Kravitz related to the Wonderland liches? This one came out of um, uh, a lot of people saying because I said that the— the liches in Wonderland had a brother named “Keats” and— who passed away and that sort of lead them down this dark path. And um, when people talked about that I think they thought I was— that uh— a lot of the stuff I’ve seen spelled Keats K-E-E-T-Z. And so it was like well that’s kind of like Kravitz and maybe that’s who that was but I—
Justin: Could be a nickname or something.
Griffin: Right, but Keats is like a— I was thinking I guess of John Keats the poet, so like K-E-A-T-S. I don’t know how it turned into K-E-E-T-Z but um, no that was not— that was not sort of my— intention.
Travis: What— can I ask one more quick attached to that Griffin—
Justin: [crosstalk] This is a bad speed round.
Travis: I know but you offhandedly said that Kravitz’s hand was warm— during the wedding.
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah...
Travis: Was that a part of a bigger reveal that now he’s alive or—
Griffin: Nah, I think it was just love.
Travis: Okay.
Griffin: The power of love. Who was the true love in exile in Crystal Kingdom? That was in one of the verses. Um, for me that— that idea because I used a lot of like, plural pronouns when talking about uh, whenever uh, Legion talked about itself because it was like, hundreds and hundreds and thousands of souls, and that like— and like Maureen’s shell housed a lot of those whenever it sang these songs. Like it was sort of a— a community of people singing about people that they you know, were sort of cut off from in the— in the um Astral Plane. So that was that.
Justin: [crosstalk] Uh- what was— okay this is one we get a lot and um and one we’ve actually had to talk about recently. What was insert-character-here’s last name?
Griffin: I don’t—I’m fine with not every character having a surname. Like I—I like this idea— but—-
Justin: [crosstalk] We have said by the way during the show that Taako’s last name is taco spelled differently. I do not think that that is accurate. I think that—
Travis: [crosstalk] No I think that was the joke I made.
Justin: A funny joke that Travis made.
Travis: I—I—it was so interesting to me to see people asking about Hurley’s last name, where I always thought that Hurley was the last name. Like, wasn’t she Detective Hurley or something?
Griffin: Lieutenant Hurley, yeah.
Justin & Travis: Yeah
Griffin: Just—I think Hurley was her name. Her name was just Hurley.
Travis: Captain Captain Bane is still my favorite name.
Griffin: Yeah his name was Captain Bane and he just happened to become a Captain in the organization.
Justin: What if Merle had picked up the Umbra Staff?
Clint: Yeah? The whole Merle losing his magic powers 800 times wouldn’t have had the same effect.
Travis: Only happened the once though dad, if you remember.
Clint: But it lasted forever.
Travis: I know it did seem like Merle didn’t have magic through a lot of the campaign [laughing a little]
Clint: Well that’s ‘cos what he did have he didn’t know how to use [breaking down into laughter]
Travis: Yeah
Griffin: Yeah, I mean the short answer is he wouldn’t— I don’t think he ever was going to. Like, that was Taako’s thing and luckily the dice were very helpful in this part where just Taako didn’t but like—er Merle didn’t get it, but like I would have had to figure out some bullshit way for— like this was Taako’s staff. This was the cool staff I had envisioned for Taako and obviously became a bigger thing because his twin sister was uh, up in there. Um, but yeah the—I— this is one of my bullshit things. Like that was Taako’s staff. It was Taako’s to get.
Justin: Uh, the—I— I don’t know what some of these are referring to so I’m gonna say—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah sure
Justin: Did they get their bracers off?
Griffin: Uh, I think yeah, I think once you switch over to Bureau of Benevolence like the sort of ironclad agreement that was required by the Bureau of Balance to make sure that like defectors didn’t happen, uh, was just not a thing and so people could take their bracers off.
Travis: I will establish canon: Magnus kept his ‘cos hey! Free bracer.
Griffin: Yeah, sure. Um, the code on Lucretia’s door, there was a puzzle in like the last episode of the Reunion Tour thing where to get into Lucretia’s office there was like a puzzle— there was a keypad with 7 digits in it. Um, and you had to punch something in. This is really grimdark and I’m really glad that you just hole-threw your fuckin way through it. Um, but the idea is that I thought you would just punch in a random string of numbers and it would let you in, and that number would have been the number of people uh, from your home plane that got consumed by The Hunger. And like, that number, that like population number would be something that like, somebody kind of could not forget about.
Clint: So at least a million, probably.
Griffin: Yeah, probably
Justin: In the seven digits for sure
Griffin: Yeah, so I’m glad that it didn’t necessarily go that way. There’s also one on here that Justin skipped, did Lup get her $15 back from Greg Grimaldis and um all I wanna say about that is Justin texted me something last night about that that I’m very excited about so [audibly smiling]
Justin: Okay.
Griffin: We’re not gonna get any deeper into it.
[Commercial break: 0:59:01-1:03:35]
Justin: Are there any other questions on here that we want— uh here’s one, Griffin, were there any character interactions or scenes that you never got to that you wish you had more time for? And this is directed at Griffin but I will say that like, I—I—I really enjoyed any time that uh, Taako and Angus spent together, and I feel like there’s a lot of these. And it’s part of what makes it good, right, that we don’t exhaust all of these possibility threads to the point where they get like, boring, but like, I will say that I was loathe to leave any scene that was like Taako and Angus because I thought—
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, for sure.
Justin: —that that was so- that was such a fun relationship.
Griffin: There were a lot Taako-and-Angus-like relationships that could have happened in this world right? Like I think Magnus and Carey’s friendship boiled up because of Magnus wanted to become a rogue and so it was like, oh okay well I know who you can train with and then that thing sort of turned out from there. A lot of my um, a lot of my… sort of uh, regrets on this particular subject are about Stolen Century. I feel like maybe I didn’t do enough with Davenport with you all, and that just happened to boil up because of the actions that you decided to take in each cycle.
Um, I feel like you could have all done more with each other, with a few exceptions. Like I was happy with how much Taako and Lup interaction there was. Uh, but yeah I think I could have done more with Davenport. I think I could have done more with Lucretia in those things. Um, like particularly like, I would have liked to explore Lup and Lucretia’s friendship a little bit more but that just, I—I—I’m very hesitant to—to um… whenever I do a scene that’s just two NPCs interacting that you all are not involved in like that is a um, I’m inherently like, not inviting you all to the party a little bit.
And so I try to be kind of— I try to limit that and only use it when I think it really needs to—to be delivered. And I think— I think it needed to be delivered a little bit more with some of the characters in Stolen Century. So that’s where most of my regrets come from. I would have liked to have had more stuff with Kravitz I think, because we went a loooong time without seeing him. But again that was partially because of what happened in the end of Wonderland.
Travis: I would like to answer some quickly. Let’s see if—how quickly— I know we haven’t done it up to this point.
Justin: Yeah, but really quickly.
Travis: Yeah, Matt asks: if you could have kept the bond summoning for one more round in the last battle who would you have picked next? I had in my head I wanted to bring back Hodge Podge um, the robot from the Lucas laboratory but I couldn’t quite figure out how to do it, and have it like— what to ask Hodge Podge for. But I thought that would have been really fun, but instead I went with the power bear on the last round. But I did have Hodge Podge in my head.
Clint: I really wanted to uh, to have [laughs] one of the characters that Stewart, Dan, or Elliot played. From Flophouse but—
Griffin:[crosstalk] Yeah I think I cut that out. You originally called in um—
Clint: Elliot, Elliot’s character
Griffin: Scales, but what we decided was you had never met Scales actually in the flesh.
Clint: Yeah…
Griffin: And so we cut it. Here’s one from Barizard, uh, who really was Jeffandrew. There were a lot of people who thought that this was a self-insert of me.
Travis: Was it not? I thought it was.
Griffin: I’m okay with that being it. It was super not how I thought about it like, when I was sort of figuring out the multiplane stuff and like the nature of existence in this world and sort of this shows this world’s philosophy about like, existence. I really like this sort of recursive idea of just like, everybody’s making worlds all the time, whether that world is a story or um. I— I had set this up a little bit with like the light of creation not being from the gods but the people who made the gods, and so like this was that.
But those people who made this world and made everything had their world made by somebody, and those people had their world made by somebody, and then a sort of infinite chain and that chain is like, existence. Um, I, I got sort of— I went pretty deep down the rabbit hole with that idea and so like, Jeffandrew was this, just this person who collaborated to help make the world of this show. And I think it’s not difficult to draw a direct line between like, that idea, that—that philosophy and what we actually literally did. I think Magnu— I think Travis tapped into this a little bit and is like “oh, Gary Gygax?” when I mentioned like, they made the rules of this world and like, you know, Wizards of the Coast made D&D and made the rules of D&D, is that who it was? {1:07:56}
Um, that was like, it was not my intention to like, say that Jeffandrew was me, and I was referring to us making this world but like I think that that, by definition of the philosophy I just kind of laid out, I think that makes sense but I, I super didn't want to do a, a self-insert—
Justin: Uh, Griffin. Kane asks “Why did tacos give Taako magic energy?”. I have an answer, but I wanna hear what your theory is.
Griffin: So like, Istus’s whole thing, uh, I like the idea of thinking about like predestination and deities and like, if there's a deity who designs fate is everything that happened in the podcast completely meaningless because all of it was sort of the design of this deity and the answer is no. My idea for Istus is that she does have sort of a design, and with, and- and bonds are, sort of, there was a connection between like bonds are these white threads that's how they're visually represented and she is um, you know, she- she does, you know, celestial needlepoint in a way?
And so bonds are, uh, they represent these connections that are extremely powerful in this world. We saw them being used, um, to accomplish these like, incredible things, whether that was like, uh, Roswell’s creation was the result of a bond, and, um, Hurley, jumping into the vines and healing Sloane, like that was a bond. Um, and so like Istus has these designs, and tries to fulfil these designs, by giving out some power in some way to— to the people who are involved in the designs. And so Taako and Joaquin’s connection was part of this fate's design, and this, this moment where you, you know, cooked together and you ate this dish, represented sort of the culmination of this bond and so both of you received the power of the bond in a very very like, um, uh, a very powerful way.
Justin: Huh. Interesting. My theory was, by the way, that tacos are good.
Travis: [laughs] They're just really great.
Justin: Tacos taste very good.
Clint: That's really good. Um, you three have grown up together, I-
Travis: What?
Clint: I have been with you the whole step of the way, we all know what each other can do, and we, the- What I love about the podcasts are that it's an extension of the dinner table at our house. Where everybody tried to outdo each other and impress each other and it was a blast. But, what was your first... WTF moment, when we did this- so- and I'm gonna preface this by giving mine. {1:10:29}
Travis: How do you mean?
Clint: When you've, when we… did something that… surprised even you. And the reason I'm saying this, maybe I can define it by example, the car race in Petals to the Metal was phenomenal. If you think about it, we described this amazing moment using just our words, just our story, and that is when I thought “What the hell, how, what are doing? This is incredible”, that was the first WTF for me.
Travis: I actually felt mine way earlier than that, um, when Phandalin was destroyed. Um, because, I remember in that moment, as Griffin is describing um, uh, it, oh now I can't really, now I'm thinking his name is Bogart- What's his name?
Griffin: Barry Bluejeans?
Travis: Uh, no no no-
Clint: Gundren?
Travis: Gundren!
Griffin: Gundren.
Travis: Gundren Rockseeker kinda going nuclear, and, I was trying to figure out how to fix it, and what- what was the solution to it to save everybody, and then we couldn't, and suddenly… Uh, this arc where we had been very jokey and making masturbation jokes throughout and you know making uh, these very juvenile jokes, we then climbed out of a well to see that, like, hundreds, maybe even thousands of people were now dead. Because of our inability to defuse the situation and like that was a really big like “Oh, shit!” moment for me.
Griffin: Um, for me it was the end of, the Rockport Limited. That- that sort of conclusion to that sort of set an outline that I think a lot of the good moments that would follow, would- would follow? Of like, all of you working together and doing this really badass thing of, like, jumping off a moving train and Taako making it disappear at the last second, and then all of you having these pretty nice moments with the other characters that came off the train. Um, that was when I was like “Oh okay, that ruled, and that's what the rest of the show’s gonna be like.”
Justin: Uh, yeah that was huge for me too, like as I cast that spell, I was thinking like “Wait, this is a satisfying conclusion, we actually-”
Travis: We did it!
Justin: We did it. I think Hurley and Sloane’s relationship, uh, and the way that scene culminated. Obviously, it had its own sort of like, trope-y baggage that we unpacked as the show went on and, and we learned from it. But I think the fact, that those two characters had that relationship within the context of this podcast, I think, was the first time I realised like, it- We've talked about this being a car that could fly, and I think that was the first time for me that the car flew-
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: And I was like, “Oh shit! Wait, this thing can do that?”, like this tool has the ability to do that? I thought that was, uh, pretty, pretty wild.
Clint: And on a smaller level, “abra-ka-fuck-you” was a moment too.
Travis: Yeah, that was also really great. {1:13:30}
Clint: [crosstalk] That really was!
Griffin: -I... yeah. I-I have a question here-[crosstalk]
Justin: -Well yeah I have a great elf(?) {1:13:35} -like yeah [crosstalk]
Griffin: [chuckles] I have a question here I really wanna get into because it's… uh I've also seen this, and I think that there was even been some sort of debate inside of this podcast about this, and so I wanted to get into it. It's from Marisa who said “One of the biggest debates I've seen in the fan-community involved Lucretia, people have some pretty strong feelings about her story. I'm pretty pro Lucretia while my friends are… not? So I was curious about how the players and the characters but most importantly you guys feel about Lucretia now that everything's been revealed.
Was she a complicated person who made some poor decisions when she saw her friends in a desperate place, or someone who felt like she knew better than her friends and made choices for everyone that she had no right to make.” On th-on this subject, as sorta the person who made Lucretia and sorta designed this story. In my mind she was never a villain. Like I never- I never ever ever ever ever thought of her not even for a little bit as… doing… doing evil in this world.. um- in my mind like- I think Lucretia’s probably my favorite… character.
Uh- especially because of the things that happened in the Stolen Century and her growth there and the way things changed. Like for me that growth was the most... concrete growth I think that any character went through in the entire show. And what I really tried to set up in the Stolen Century is that like this is a really tough thing you all were going through and you all had different ways of dealing with it. And her way was very… um… was… perhaps over-protective. Right? And so this thing that she did she knew that you all were hurting… and she had this i-idea for how to solve it and everybody else's idea was different, and she thought that the idea that you all went with was… wrong.
Was inherently wrong. And so she grew from being this character who was very much on the sidelines, writing about the things that other people were doing, and taking actions into her own hands and simultaneously like, making her friends forget this like really really difficult and painful ordeal that they all had- had gone through. So in my mind she was… she was not evil. She was never ever ever ever the villain. Um… and- but at the same time I think that the way that you all sort of… reacted to her actions in different ways was like… really interesting.
Travis: I think that what it comes down to, cause I think we ran into this a lot too and… and honestly in-in games like D&D and stories like this it's one of the hardest things for me… is really- realizing that much like in real life it’s very rarely… a yes or no… like good and bad… way to do something. And so I remember when we landed on… the planet with the robots and we found the jewe- the gem and we had to decide like- [crosstalk]
Griffin: -Oh yeah!
Travis: if-if we leave the gem and the hunger consumes it, it will grow that much more powerful, but if we destroy it we're basically killing life on this planet.
Griffin: Hey let's- hey let's talk about this! We re-recorded that bit- [crosstalk]
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Cause uh- originally they destroyed the fuckin’ world. [crosstalk]
Travis: Mhm…
Griffin: They all destroyed the world and then flew away and then that was the ending and we finished recording and then almost like we hung up on the skype call, and then like a minute later we started texting like “That sucked. That was-”
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: “that was- that was not the tone of this show. That was not what we should go for.” And w- [crosstalk]
Travis: I felt bad! Like I went downstairs and talked with Teresa afterwards and I was like “That was wrong. [crosstalk] The thing we did was wrong and I feel bad about it”
Griffin: Yeah and- it- It was not a situation where like… you all made a tough choice and then um… regretted it and then maybe that regrets could have been in the show in some sort of tangible way that would have been good and so we would trade that. This was like a- “this doesn't match the tone of the show, it doesn't match what these characters would actually do…” um. It's just like, it is what happened. And it was wrong.
Travis: But that- but that leads me to that feeling of like… it-it-it allowed me to relate to Lucretia in that way of like what she had to do- she didn't relish it. I don't think- the difference between a villain. And a tragic hero. Is a villain thinks that the wrong thing they are doing is right. And a tragic hero… does the wrong thing… because that is the only way they can see to do good. Like they- it's-it’s a subtle difference but I don't think Lucretia reveled in erasing people's memories.
I don't think she liked lying to her friends, I think it was- My take on it was it was very isolating and it was the hard thing to do… um, and that it's the only way she saw of her protecting her friends was to do the wrong thing? for the right reasons? um… and so um I never- I actually see her as a very tragic figure and that is why… Magnus hugs her when he does is like this feeling of like… “I understand that the thing you had to do you didn't enjoy, but you were trying to protect us,” and if there's anyone that understands that, it's Magnus.
Justin: Okay, I- uh… just to put a button in this real quick. Uh… this show- a lot of this show is about the power of stories and… the-the-the way that people’s stories impact you and the power that those stories have to change things. And I think that… Lucretia… from Taako’s perspective Lucretia… robbed him of… the most important story in his life. Without a one hundred percent guarantee that she was going to be able to restore that. And like Taako… has impulses towards making connections like I've talked about, but like Taako’s not a hero. Taako would watch the world burn if it meant like… the people he cared about- really cared about were- were safe and protected [crosstalk] and-
Griffin: And Lucretia like approached this situation from the exact polar opposite sort of- [crosstalk] sort of viewpoint
Justin: Exactly! [crosstalk] right. But like… she wasn't losing a sister in the deal, Taako was. And I think that like- that imbalance is where… Taako's… distrust came from. And like I-I-I'm here to tell you: I do not know if that will ever… i don't- i don't kn- we're not like uhh… filling in plot gaps or whatever. But like, From my perspective I don't think that that… it probably softened over time, but I don't think the sting of that is something that Taako would ever sort of let go of, even though things worked out.
Griffin: I'm okay with that. I think it's really interesting that you all responded to… the truth of the situation in different ways. And I don't think that it paints Lucretia with any kind of brush. And I think that people who say like- I-I think this idea of like “oh well Lucretia’s a bad person” or “Lucretia’s a villain” is sort of like looking at this situation as if it had an easy answer. [crosstalk]
Justin: -Yeah it's very reductive
Griffin: -I tried to- I tried to inject a lot of nuance into what she had to do… because like, I think that's the only way it makes sense with her character because she's not an evil person, she's an incredibly good person who did this really really really really difficult thing. And so people who say- I-I got personally kind of frustrated because I had never thought of her as a villain and I saw a lot of people who did… um. I think it is reductive to say like “oh well she is- she's evil because of what she did.” She's not. She- she just isn't.
Travis: I wanna jump back to a completely different thing, uh dad mentioned the questions from Casper about moments that really stuck with you, and like I just saw that as I was scrolling down. I wanna say the uh- bank. Fight. With uh- in Refuge, with uh- with Roswell. Where we were trying to like find the book and say the code- basically everything in The Eleventh- I think Eleventh Hour was my favorite conceptual arc.
Griffin: Same.
Travis: Of- of the reset, but like that moment was such an interesting like “what we are doing is wrong.” Like I remember playing as Magnus and having to do bad stuff to move the story forward? And like “oh well this is gonna reset so… I guess I gotta deal with doing this terrible thing to this nice person.” And like… a lot of that was- was a really interesting kind of dichotomy of like “how do I move the story forward and balanced the fact that I know that I wouldn't do this if I was afraid of the ramifications.” It was very interesting.
I was just gonna answer a quick… question. Charlotte wanted to know “Is Magnus allowed to bring his dogs on the burence- uh bureau’s moon base?” And the answer is: the first thing Magnus trains his dogs not to do is to [crosstalk] run off the moon base.
Griffin: -Run off the edge- it's very important. Um… Here's a quick one from Lauren “How much stop-down get edited out? Uh… How many takes of each thing? It's wonderfully produced in a compact way, but when D&D is played there are tons of stop-down moments, rules reading, and audio dull. Discussions about what to do next, what a character wants to do in particular, etc. etc.” Uh I- we edit a lot. We- uh- I edit like a shit-ton out. Um… and… I think in like the finale we recorded probably close to three and a half hours? And I edited pretty much a full hour out of that? So there's a lot. And there's a lot of people who hear that and are like “aw cmon release the- release the tapes” No, this thing is- [crosstalk]
Travis: [like a horse] No.
Justin: Yeah dog.
Griffin: And it's not because we're embarrassed [crosstalk]
Justin: And it's not takes. It's not- th- the question was phrased that way like “how many takes of each thing?” We're not actors (by trade) and- well… [crosstalk]
Griffin: So. Yeah you all didn't do that, you all didn't do that. But I did. A little bit. Especially in the later episodes, I recorded some sort of more monologue-y stuff that maybe I didn't have prepared when we started playing, so I recorded those in and dropped them in later, and I would sorta take multiple takes on that. Johann’s like of “You're gonna fight- you're gonna hafta fight and you're going to win.” I worked on that for like- forty five minutes. Just doing a hundred takes of it just because I really wanted the best delivery of it. [crosstalk] Angus’s uh...
Travis: But that's different deliveries into not like we were improvising different… shit every time, [crosstalk] it’s not like Anchorman…
Justin: Right, sure. We never-- I don’t think we ever had to re-react to a thing, that we had done before. Like, we never once did another take of something.
Travis: Except destroying the gem.
Griffin: Except destroying the gem. That was--
Justin: Well, that was a different-- I mean, but like, that was a meaningful story change. We didn’t like, redo a moment. It was just changing how that moment went.
Griffin: Should we, uh… There are a lot of other questions that we could talk about, but I know we kinda have to wrap up here. But, do we want to spend some time talking about what we have planned for coming up, because I really want folks to understand that we’re not done doing The Adventure Zone.
Travis: Yes.
Justin: So we’re done doing The Adventure Zone.
Griffin: No, stop. So we have two live shows that are gonna go up. Our live show in Austin, which was my sort of Persona a little bit inspired one? Man, that one got really out of hand. And then the San Diego show which [Clint laughs] was our, oh, our take on the Tomb of Horrors? It was very-- that one was like one of my favorites we’ve done live. So we’re gonna have those go up in a while, for the next, I guess, month, since this is biweekly.
Um, and then, we’re gonna start doing a bunch of different stuff. We’re gonna be doing more short-form, probably two-to-three episodes long mini-arcs that will be essentially-- well I guess you could think of them as pilots, but really it’s gonna be us playing new games, taking turns DMing… I guess we have to say GM now, for playing non-Dungeons and Dragons stuff. Uh, GMing, taking turns GMing, exploring new worlds and new genres, and part of that will be like, us sort of searching for what we want to do for a longer thing, as like season 2?
But it’s also like, um, going to like, I think help us learn how to tell stories in this way. For me, I started listening to Friends of the Table, another actual play podcast I talk a lot about, and that was very-- that was revelatory to me? Because it kind of like, showed me what else you could do with actual play storytelling? And so I think once we all kind of-- and they play like, other games that aren’t DND-- and so I think if we take some turns playing some non-DND games and try telling other stories, we’re gonna learn so much, regardless of what we end up doing for the next season. That will help us make that season better.
Justin: This can be pretty experimental. And like--
Griffin: I’m worried, and we’re all really worried about, right? We’re all really nervous. ’Cause we made this thing that we love and we’re so proud of and we know really resonated with people, and to move away from that into a new venture is like, really really really really scary. And I hope everybody is as down with this idea as we are, ’cause I-I know epis-- the first time we put out a new episode in this new world with new games and new rules and new-- new GM, there are gonna be--
Travis: New characters.
Griffin: New characters. There are gonna be people who say like, “Ugh, this isn’t as good,” or “Ugh, I wish you would go back to the other thing,” or “Ugh, I wish…” You know. Whatever we do for season 2, whoever ends up GMing it, there are gonna-- people who say like, “Ugh, we should have done the other thing” or “oh, I wish somebody else was GMing, I thought that they had done a better job.”
Clint: I don’t think that’s gonna happen for these mini-episodes.
[crosstalk]
Justin: --absolutely going to happen.
[Laughter]
Travis: Let me go ahead and say, um, if you complain enough, we will just go back to the old characters and the old story. [crosstalk] So make sure you tweet at us a lot.
Griffin: Travis, I-- God, Travis, you are f-- That’s not true. It’s not true. [laughter] What Travis just said is not true. This story’s done. And I don’t want to touch it. I am-- I love it. I love-- we have this thing now, and it’s finished, and for the rest of our lives, it’s finished, and we have it, and it’s done, and I’m so proud of it.
Travis: Can I say on a side, on a side, separate note to that point, I-I had a child over the course of recording The Adventure Zone, and-- The Adventure Zone Balance, and like, the idea that in a couple years, when she’s older, I can play this for her, as like this thing I made--
Griffin: It’s really special.
Travis: We made-- It’s very important to me.
Griffin: But it’s-- and it’s done. So we have to move on. We have to try new stuff, we have to do this new stuff. And I hope that you’ll all give us the benefit of the doubt, and understand that we’re going to be improved, just by playing this stuff. Even if it doesn’t work out! If we do a two or three episode arc, and we hit the end of it, and we’re like “Oh, you know, it never really clicked and we didn’t really like it,” we hope you understand that like, we will be better now. Because we have tried that thing.
There is no downside to this experimentation that we are gonna be doing ’cause I really think it’s gonna result in us having a super clear picture of what we want the next thing to be, and starting out with that clear picture, which we did not have in Balance, is going to lead to a story that I cannot fucking wait to get into.
Justin: And I would-- and then that benefit of the doubt, what I would say is this: we will of course as always, like, listen to what y’all are saying, and [Griffin: Mh-mh.] I’m anxious to hear, you know, once we get somewhere that we’re happy with, like of course I’m anxious to hear what people think of it and like, use that feedback to sort of help us guide whatever, but like… The two things I would say about that is one, please understand that it is gonna be us experimenting and I would ask you to try to be respectful of that, the fact that you are hearing experimentation and not the finished product as, like, it is not going to be on the level that Balance was towards the end--
Griffin: It just won’t. Yeah.
Justin: It just took a long, long long time to get there. So like, please try to keep it constructive, is what I would say. And also, please understand that like, whatever we do moving forward and whatever like… This is not a public voting process, there is no like-- we are not-- you know, 51 votes for this thing, 50-- 49 votes for this other thing, okay we do the 51 votes thing… That’s not in any way what’s happening, so don’t feel like you need to weigh in to make your voice heard so we’ll… It’s not--
Griffin: Understand how messy that would get for us, as creators and also family members? Like, we all try to approach this thing from a ego-free standpoint. And so like-- the introduction of a like--
Clint: Some of us.
Griffin: --whoever’s thing that gets the most votes is gonna be the next thing-- that can’t… What we are going to do is the thing that we are most excited about, that we think is gonna lead to the best story. {1:29:07}
Justin: And it may-- and it may not be, I would argue that, like, the best version of this may be that, like, the second season of The Adventure Zone, is not, uh, one of these sort of like mini things that we do.
Griffin: [crosstalk] yeah
Justin: I, I like the idea that, like, maybe the mini things are things like Knights that we can return to and revisit and, um, and that sort of thing but, like, not necessarily going to be those show-- It’s, like, not necessarily going to be these stories either. Um, so like I understand what a big ask that is to, uh, if you’ve been listening to the show for a long time and we-- and we have talked candidly, like, we understand that, like, we will lose some people. Like there will be some people who wanna bounce and if you’re listening to this I hope that’s not you and I hope that you’ll hang in there with us but, like, we understand that like-- And you know what? Honestly? That’s fine. I’m really happy with Balance. I’m really proud of it and if that’s all you wanted and you wanna move on to other stuff, like, completely get it. Like we, I-I-I-I--
Griffin: [crosstalk] We’re not-- Justin’s not being snide and we are not being snide when we say that.
Travis(?): mm-mm {1:30:10}
Griffin: It’s-- It is-- It is the truth. Not all stories are gonna resonate with the same people. And so, like, if you do not like the next thing and you want to go, like, I fucking completely, completely totally understand that; I absolutely get it and I’m not being shitty when I say that. It is-- It is-
Justin: [crosstalk] I w-- I would say though, I would say though, don’t do that, because it’s gonna get pretty buck wild and you do definitely wanna be on board for how buck wild it gets
Clint: So an- and let me also say, wait a minute, on the other side of the coin, just for a second let me say as the dad: it’s still us. It’s still the four of us telling stories and the things that we brought to the table in Balance-
Justin: For now. There’s some contract stuff that we’re-
[crosstalk]
Travis: [crosstalk] Yeah, we’re still trying to work that out.
Clint: [crosstalk] Why don’t you ever tell me about that?
Travis: I have a big ask, frankly, like I’m-- if you want me back- oough. Um, I will say I’m especially nervous ‘cause I’m building mine from scratch?
Griffin: Yeah, Travis is making a game for a western arc, right?
Travis: Yeah, and, uh, let me also say that that-- there will be a lot of, like, once again people saying, like, “oh, that’s very similar-”. I don’t that I’m, like, reinventing the wheel. I don’t think that mine is a standalone thing but I, like, had an idea for a story I wanted to tell and couldn’t find the perfect thing. So instead, I came up with the story I wanted to tell and now I’m building mechanics around it and building a set around it. So I’m-
Griffin: [crosstalk] And that’s-- That’s uh, that’s a big risky thing and I know because I kind of made a game for Stolen Century and there are things I would go back and change. Like, this is-- this is what I’m talking about. Like, for some reason, if the mechanics, like, we hit the end of it like “oh there’s stuff I would have changed about that game”, okay. But we’re still gonna be better; Travis is gonna be better because Travis is going to understand game systems in a way that is going to be, like, really really really informative. Um--
[crosstalk] {1:31:56-1:32:01 it’s all pretty intelligible but it’s also 2am so my brain can’t sort out who’s saying what}
Clint: Uh, mostly because it’s the worst-kept secret in the world, I had five people come up to me, five students come up to me during class yesterday and say “so, you’re the new GM, huh?” So, I’m gonna do the first pilot. It is going to be a superhero-based-- can I say the game system?
Griffin: [crosstalk] Yeah, we’re playing-- playing Fate.
Clint: We’re gonna play Fate, gonna use the Fate system so it’s-- it’s, uh, all new there and, uh, the name of this arc, if you want to call it that, is TAZ Commitment.
Justin: Commitment
Griffin. Commitment. I like that. Um, I have two ideas. One is sort of a, one is in a game called Monster of the Week that I- I wanna be kind of like, Persona-based while having sort of the monster hunt-y of shows like Supernatural and stuff like that, um, in a town in West Virginia, uh, that I’m very excited about. Um, and I have another story that I wanna do using a game called Uncharted Worlds that is kind of a post-Earth space opera about people who try to, um, preserve the things that they want to preserve from, um, from Earth, uh, that I think is gonna be really neat. Those are-- those are my two ideas right now.
Justin: I’m gonna do the greatest detective story ever.
Travis: Okay
Justin: Uh, It’s go-- it’s gonna be great. Um-
Clint: Liveshows. Wanna mention liveshows real quick.
Griffin: Yeah. We got-- we got
Justin: Haven’t we already-- haven’t we said that? Like, we’re [crosstalk]
Griffin: [crosstalk] I think so. Like, we’ve got one coming up in November, um, and then-- or October, and then we, uh, in Nashville, and then we have another one coming up in Tacoma. Those will will be Tres Horny Boys and we’ll keep doing that.
Justin: For the foreseeable future.
Griffin: But, um, let’s wrap up ‘cause Juice has to go. But I just wanna say--I’ve said it a hundred times-- thank you all so much for listening and for giving us this experience. Like, it’s not-- it’s not a like, I don’t want people to think that in, like, a crass way, like “oh you all have helped our careers by making this show successful”. You all helped me, like personally, because I didn’t know that this was a thing that we could do. And-
Travis: Yeah
Griffin: And now I do and that experience and having this finished thing, um, that was also really special to a lot of other people, like, that is the thing that matters to me and is going to matter to me for literally the rest of my life. Like, this show changed my life and, um, the- that is, like, in large part thanks to the- the community that sort of grew up around it. So thank you all so so so much.
Travis: I-I-I wou-- than-- I grew creatively, not just from doing the show but from how people reacted to it and the feedback they gave and it taught me a lot about being a creator, um, and what that can mean to people? The things that you create and how important those things can be to people, um, was way more informative to me than any actual thing that happened in the story was learning about the impact the story had on others and the kind of responsibility of that. Um, I-- so yeah. Thank you everybody for listening and- and being a part of it so far.
Clint: And I- I made a whole bunch of new friends. I mean a shitload of new friends. I love the- the supporters, uh, and the fans and the people who listen and I got to do it with the three most important people in my life. I mean, there’s no downside there.
Travis: Who?
Clint: Uh, Charlie and Henry and Bebe.
Justin: And, uh, I guess from me, just, you’re welcome.
Griffin: Okay
[Clint Laughing]
Justin: Wanna make sure.(?) You’re welcome. {1:35:26}
Griffin: Um, that’s it for The The Adventure Zone Zone. That’s it for Balance, really.
Justin: Yeah
Griffin: And now we’re gonna move on to the next thing, we’re gonna put out a couple liveshows while we all take a, I think, well-earned rest and… next ti--
Clint: Especially you. You were amazing.
Justin: Yay. Hooray for Griffin.
Travis: Yaay Griffin! [clapping]
Justin: Fi- finally someone tells Griffin he’s doing a good job. Uh, so on that note--
Griffin: Uh, oh oh oh, the, uh, new album is up on bandcamp of all the music for the last three arcs of Reunion Tour and Stolen Century and Story and Song. you can get it at griffinmcelroy.bandcamp.com and all the album sales, uh, through the rest of August are going to the, uh, SPLC.
Justin: Cool, okay. That’s gonna do it for us. Bye everybody. Hang in there. We love you.
Griffin: Next time we talk to you we’ll be doing a new story! Bye!
[Chorus of “Bye”s]

[Deja Vu (TTAZZ Remix) plays]
Travis: It’s the, it’s a show… it’s the, where, it’s our own aftershow— in the show—
Justin: Damn, that’s a good start.
[Laughter]
Travis: Well, I’m trying to think of how to phrase it, you know, it’s an aftershow… but during, it’s a during-show… concurrent…
Justin: [crosstalk] Travis began the show being chased down a hill by Prince Humperdinck. And he threw himself down, roll roll roll roll roll, when he got to the bottom, he began… [hill-rolling grunts and oofs]
Travis: You know, sometimes, when you, you know, I think— this applies to the show too, you know, sometimes you open your mouth, and you’re like, the words are gonna be there! And sometimes they are, you know?
Justin: Yeah! Sometimes they are!
Travis: And you make magic.
Griffin: This is the The The Zone, Adventure Adventure Zone Zone Zone Zone Zone…
Travis: Yep!
Griffin: It’s the talk show where we talk about the thing, and it’s the MaxFun Drive! And we’re done with the experimental arcs, there’s a lot of stuff going on. And… maybe we should answer some questions, we got a ton, thank you for sending them in. Um, thank you everybody who wanted to know if Errol would get his root beer, which is to say the 400 of you that emailed about Errol ever getting his root beer, the answer is: [exaggerated wordless “I don’t know” noise]. So that’s one question down, we’re already deep in the shit.
Travis: And that’s the biggest cliffhanger established in any of the mini-arcs. Um…
Justin: Let’s take a quick moment before we get rolling, though. I wanna thank— thank you to our fanbase. We’ve never had a name for them, so I’m gonna start calling you Bachelor Nation. Thank you Bachelor Nation for your support of the Adventure Zone. We, it honestly means a lot. If you weren’t with us this time last year, we should mention that this is the MaxFunDrive, which means it’s the one time of year we come to you hat in hand and say, “Hey, could you give us a little bit of money for what you have taken from us?” Which is our gifts— and we have—
Travis: That’s how we always phrase it, yup yup yup.
Griffin: Right, yes. So we’re a part of the MaxFun network and the network is supported by donors like you, hopefully, where we ask you, during the MaxFun Drive, if you enjoy our show, think about supporting us. You can go to MaximumFun.org/donate, find out about the different membership levels and the gifts you will receive if you donate at them— we’re going to talk a lot more about them. Just to let you know, though, $5 a month: that’ll get you all the bonus content that every show on the network has ever done, and that includes an episode we did this year that Justin ran called The Adventure Zone: Elementary. In which we played a game called “Four Sherlock Holmes and a Vampire (Who Is Also One of the Aforementioned Sherlock Holmes)”— it was very fun, and we’ve gotten a lot of very sweet tweets, sweet little— sweetie tweeties, about it. And we appreciate it.
Justin: [overlapping] I don’t think I got enough credit, and this was Dad’s idea… I don’t think I got enough credit for continuing our naming scheme.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: That’s absolutely brilliant.
Justin: That was Dad’s idea. I shouldn’t take—
Travis: I also want to say along with that, there’s also— that you can hear The Adventure Zone: Knights, which is a steampunk one that I created, including special guest Lin-Manuel Miranda playing D&D for the first time ever.
Griffin: It was very good.
Clint: And it was probably the last, wasn’t it— the last—
Griffin: And probably the last, yes.
{3:48 - Q1: Live Shows}
Travis: You can check that out at MaximumFun.org/donate, go now if you’re interested in hearing that stuff. Don’t wait, because it’s so easy to forget it. And the MaxFun Drive only goes two weeks. We’re going to talk more about it, but first, let’s see, let’s start with the questions. This question is probably for Griffin, but maybe for all of us: “Will Tres Horny Boys still be the focus of live shows moving forward, or will live shows start featuring Amnesty?” And that’s from Brian.
Griffin: I think, I think we may get to a point where it would be cool to do an Amnesty show. But everything we’ve talked about since we wrapped up Balance is that we would continue doing, you know, the Balance crew for the live shows. So, um, we want to have—
Justin: I think it would be hard for us to— I— the only time I see it, maybe, is like, after Amnesty is complete, maybe wanting to return to it for like a one-off, but honestly, I love the Balance world, and I love those characters, and it— honestly, I would be too sad if I thought we weren’t going to go back to that.
Griffin: Yeah, for sure. This is, it’s a way of us, for us to keep carrying the torch while also sort of moving on to new things. Because I think of the live shows, and the episodes that come out of that, as weirdly like their own… thing. And so that’s how I justify it.
Travis: [crosstalk] Well, that’s the thing. With Balance, because the story is completed, it’s so much easier to do one-offs without having to worry about character development or plot development or anything. Whereas if we try to do a live show, like, in the middle of a live— of an arc that’s still going— you know, it’s not as— it’s easy to do semi-canonical one-offs with, you know, Bureau of Balance, right. But we can’t really do that with an arc we’re still establishing.
Clint: Could we do two acts? Could we do, like, Balance in the first act, and Amnesty in the second act?
Griffin: Yeah, sure, let’s just double up the fuckin’ work.
Justin: The problem with that is really Griffin, he’s the rate limiting factor on that.
[Others scoff]
Justin: I know.
Clint: Well, I’ve already got my— I’ve got my Ned cosplay all ready!
Griffin: Listen, every night before I go to bed, I do my stretches to try to grow two extra lobes onto my brain. Two extra Lisa Loebs right on my brain. But no luck so far.
{6:05 - Q2 and 3: Space Game? and Cliffhangers}
Justin: “Were you guys considering a space-type game? If so, what would the game have been called, and why didn’t it happen? Or do I have something to impatiently wait for?” That’s from Alex.
Travis: Yeah, this is a— we got this question a lot, because in our artwork, we did include a section that looks like spaceships.
Griffin: Well, it looks like spaceships because it is spaceships. I had an idea for a space campaign that I wanted to do, that I’ve had for years, that I was thinking we were going to get to, doing these experimental— during the experimental arc phase. But— and maybe this is, like, a good time to talk about this— it’s been eight months since we wrapped up Balance. And the reason we’re kind of jumping into season two and Amnesty now is just like, we all feel this sort of— I don’t know what the right word is here— maybe “anxiety”— about, just we’re ready for— we’re ready to do Season 2, we miss—
Travis: Anticipation. [crosstalk]
Griffin: Anticipation.
Travis: It’s not anxiety, ‘cause—
Clint: There’s a void! There’s a void—
Griffin: Anticipation looks a lot like anxiety up in this old brain, but yeah, it— doing the experimental arcs has been really cool and we learned so much and we’ve— I’m really happy with the stuff that we did, but there is something about expanding a world and knowing that you have, like, a long runway in front of you to expand a world that we’ve missed. So we’ve been ready to do it. So it just wasn’t right, but, yeah, I still have this idea for a space game… um… and…
Travis: If I can jump in and expand to a larger point, because the next question is from Lulu about Dust, and Commitment and we left them on cliffhanger endings, and if we’re ever going to get back to them. Here’s one of the things, like, the biggest takeaway I would say, from the mini-arcs, is when we were doing Balance, we were so focused on it. And that’s how we ended up with three years of it, right? Because it just felt like, we can’t start on anything else til this is done. And now, from doing the mini-arcs, it kind of— was an inadvertent test and an accidental proving ground of like, “Oh, we can work on a lot of different things at once.” So one of the things that we’re kind of looking to do with moving forward, is to have Amnesty be, like, you know, the main story in the main weeks. In what some might call “good Thursdays”—
Griffin: Good Thursdays. [Travis: Right, but then the—] Which by the way, this is an inadvertent way of addressing another question that comes later that we can answer really quickly, we are going to go back to biweekly, because now, I think, that all of us had a run at being DM, it’s— doing that shit every week is so brutal— it’s so hard.
Travis: Yeah. But now, like, if I’m ready to do another, you know, couple episodes of Dust, we can record those and do them in the off weeks. Or if Dad is ready to do another arc of Commitment, we do ‘em in the off weeks. Or if Justin comes up with something he wants to DM, we can do it in the off weeks. Or if we just find a really funny one-off like we did with the Sherlock Holmes game, we can put it up in the off weeks.
Griffin: I would fucking love to do more one-offs. That was— that’s something we never do, specifically play— all the experimental arcs, I was happy with, but we didn’t really play short-form— games that were designed for short form campaigns. We played like, long-form games, except for Four Sherlock Holmes and a Vampire, and that was fucking really— it was really fun, and it was really funny, and it gave us a lot of freedom to just, like, goof off, I feel like? But also we— there was no tension between us and how we were playing the game. Because the game was designed to be one episode of a podcast. If that makes sense. I would love to do more stuff like that.
Travis: And I do also want to tie it back to the MaxFun Drive, because one of the reasons we’re looking to generate more content is like, we know that it matters to you. Because we’ve seen your support over the last couple years and we know how much this kind of content and how much you look forward to it. So it’s one of the things we’ve been looking at for a while, of, “How do we make it weekly, or how do we generate more content.” And the thing is, is like, when we’re doing the main storyline, we just can’t— we can’t consistently do it weekly, it’s just too much, right? But, now that we have all these other threads to pluck at, we can fill in some of those gaps, generate more content for you, because we know how much that matters to you. And it’s because of your support for things like MaxFun Drive that we know you care about this content enough for us to find opportunities to make more of it.
Justin: Call it “content” again, I’m going to [crosstalk] jump out a window.
Griffin: It’s really rough.
Justin: It’s so rough.
Griffin: Which is not to say that we are going to go weekly, or like every off week, we’re going to have some other thing—
Justin: Hell no.
Griffin: There’s no way we would be— this will be very very very sporadic. But this is, this is just a way for us to, we loved these worlds so much, as we do want to return to them, and this is kind of what we’re thinking—
{11:09 - Commitment and Fate}
Justin: I tell you, I want to talk— now that we’ve played all the experimental arcs, and this isn’t an actual question but I wanted to discuss it real quick: I want to talk about Commitment, because Commitment was really interesting to me in that— Commitment was probably the character that I thought the most about, because we had the most down time in between, and it’s the character that I was really… like, I was very excited about Irene and Kardala. I actually think an interesting thing with Commitment is that I think the world and the characters were all super cool— I’m not sure that game— I’m not sure Fate necessarily lends itself to what we do. And I only realized that after playing the other games, and it’s an interesting phenomenon, in that… Fate seems very well-designed for storytelling, but I think that it is— it creates a sort of collaborative storytelling that is more interesting to the people playing it than it would be to people, necessarily, listening to it. [Others agreeing] Dad, did you, like, think that’s a fair take—
Clint: Yeah. Yeah, I went with Fate because it, when I came across it, it— that was what appealed to me about it, was— the storytelling angle of it, and the collaborative— it felt very theatrical to me. And it was about the storytelling, and about character development. But at the same time, it did have mechanism for conflict, and if you’re going to do a superhero story, there has to be battle. There has to be an element of… battle involved in that. I think that’s just, you know, part of the whole story. So yeah, I would love to bring back Commitment and pursue the storylines and the plotlines, but I might look for a game that lends itself, you know, more towards that kind of format. Because it wasn’t a typical Jack Kirby, you know, every two pages somebody’s in a fist fight kind of deal… but it, that is— it does need to have that mechanism, though.
Griffin: That’s not to say that it’s a bad game—
[crosstalk: “No!” “Not at all”]
Griffin: I think it’s a very cool game, it’s just, the same way that we probably couldn’t have done Fourth Edition Dungeons & Dragons, for Balance, right, because that was much more about how your characters are in physical space as compared to Fifth Edition, which was much more just talking over a table, like… certain games don’t really fit what we do, and like, tracking aspects and running the—
Justin: Tracking aspects was the big thing. I think that is so perfect for having no cards in front of you, and if somebody actually designed— like I think someone would actually need to design software specifically to handle that remotely where everybody’s looking at the same cards and stuff— [crosstalk] tracking it in chat.
Griffin: But then even if— even if we can see it, the audience… that’s a lot to ask them to remember. [crosstalk: chorus of agreement]
Travis: Right, that’s the thing, is, I feel like one of the things, one of the big learning experiences from doing the mini-arcs was like, “What is the mix at which Adventure Zone works best,” right? Because there are a lot of actual play podcasts that I absolutely love, but I don’t really consider Adventure Zone a pure actual play podcast, because I don’t feel like— I don’t feel like you could listen to Adventure Zone and come away understanding exactly how to play the game. Like that was one of the things with Dust that I really liked about Urban Shadows, is it was such a loose rule structure that I think maybe like 25 percent of each episode was actually about gameplay. [crosstalk]
Justin: Twenty-five percent would actually be a good reflection of my current understanding of the rules of Urban Shadows.
{14:57 - Q4: Actual Play Vs Narrative}
Griffin: So this is a good opportunity to talk about, you talked about sort of how we balance, no pun intended, between, like, different— different sort of goals, as we’re doing the show. And we got sort of two different questions here that we can sort of address this at— Rob asked, and this is something that was got from a lot of folks in a lot of different iterations: “A lot of discussion on popular TAZ internet forums lately have been focused around the actual play component of TAZ and whether or not that has or should take a backseat to the more narrative-driven aspects of the show. The “arms outstretched” moment of Balance that were [sic] born out of crazy dice rolls, or the surprise spellcasting like Phantom Steed, are the reason a lot of us listen. Will Monster of the Week deliver on the actual play aspects the same way D&D did? Any insights to this would be super rad.”
And what I think is so interesting about this question… it’s all, I think, like a matter of… perspective? Because those two examples that you listed— and I know there’s a lot of people who were put off when we switched off D&D, and when we announced that Season 2 would not be in D&D, even though that’s something that I feel like we’ve been pretty up front with, since Balance wrapped up… both “arms outstretched” and Phantom Steed do… in some ways, sort of like, those are sort of things that happened kind of because of the rules of D&D that we were playing, but they are also two big examples of us explicitly saying “fuck the rules.”
Phantom Steed, like if you want to look at it literally, like, that’s a spell, you have to, like, I don’t know, channel for a minute. It’s not designed to create a magic binicorn that— first of all it’s not supposed to create a unicorn at all, right, it’s supposed to create a horse, but whatever. But it’s not designed to catch somebody out of the air as they’re falling off of a moving race car? And “arms outstretched” was literally three back-to-back-to-back examples of things that, like, completely break the rules of D&D. Having a magic item that instantly rips the soul out of somebody’s body is not, like, in the Player’s Handbook, and having Soul Jar cast you into this astral plane where you can fly around and grab people as they’re being sucked into a hell— death dimension, and then— Dad’s spell, I forget what it was, but that wasn’t how that fucking worked even a little bit.
Clint: It never was!
Griffin: Not even a little bit! And so like, there are things that people bring up, and when I think about things like Phantom Steed, and that’s one that we get a lot, is like, “I’m worried stuff like that’s not gonna happen in Monster of the Week,” like… stuff like that also shouldn’t happen in Dungeons & Dragons! [crosstalk] If we’re following the rules…
Travis: Don’t you worry about that!
Justin: Listen, I think that you can also chalk this up to the experimental arcs, in that we had— there are two things that I think have been sort of missing from what people would classically think is the Adventure Zone, that I believe we’ll be able to do better in Amnesty, in like— and that is, more dice rolls, and letting mechanics dictate some plotting. And also, like, more goofy shit? Because we each had— not me, but— I think everybody had stories that they wanted to get through, and we had a pace that we wanted to work through, with these stories, and I think that because of that, we were moving at, like, we tend to a lot more stuff in exposition and storytelling and dialogue versus leaning on the rules.
I think that also betrays a lack of confidence in those rules and those mechanics. And having an idea of how they work. Like, you gotta understand y’all, we’re pretty good at bullshitting, we’ve been doing for a long time, we’re not necessarily great at playing these games because we’ve never played them before. And trying to like, learn a game, while you create a story, while you improv, all the lines and the dialogue, and also try to make it, like, entertaining… is really fucking hard. And I think that like—
Griffin: Especially during introductory things, like all these mini-arcs were. This was the case in Balance, you go back and listen to the first couple episodes of literally every arc, and especially later on, it is mostly exposition. Because in order to, like, create this space where y’all can find your own solutions to stuff, and sort of explore your thing, it does entail… especially, fucking Eleventh Hour? That is a lot of hand-holding to get you guys into this kind of complicated scenario of a town where things reset every hour, and “Here’s what you need to know about that, okay, now we can do it.” And that felt like how all these mini-arcs are. And now that we’re kind of moving into Season 2, it feels like we’re going to have a lot more room to play around.
Clint: And I think Dust, I think Travis had to deal with that even more, in Dust, because you’re doing a murder mystery. You’re doing something that is basically: here’s some clues! [crosstalk: agreement] So you can figure it out! And there’s— there’s a lot on there. I know when, in Commitment— you have certain things you— you know where the story is going. I did not have an ending. I honest to God did not have an ending planned.
Griffin: You mean you didn’t expect us to fly through the air on a helicopter eating strombolis as we take a bad guy to the White House? [Laughing] That was the best fucking ending to any story ever.
Clint: I have an imagination, but it’s not quite like that. I did not know how the story was going to end, and so, you know— for me, I don’t know about the rest of you guys, but for me, the toughest thing was pacing. [crosstalk: agreement]
Griffin: That’s true for everything, yeah.
Travis: A lot of people pointed out that like, Dust really felt like it ended fairly suddenly, and it could’ve gone another episode, but here’s the thing: I had written down, I have like a hundred pages of shit that I wrote for Dust, but I’d written down, here’s all the information that will lead them to this, right? And then suddenly it was done. And I didn’t want to have an episode where it’s just, like, “I don’t know!” —Right, because that’s not good pacing. And the other thing is, when you’re writing a mystery, is like: yeah, if they go to here, and talk to this person, it will all be figured out. And that wasn’t happening. You know what I mean? And so… it was one of those things a lot of people asked about, like, the Banshee just straight up saying like, “Don’t trust Conners”—
Griffin: “Here’s who the killer is,” yeah.
Travis: But it was like, I expected them to have a lot more conversations with Conners leading up to that. Right? And it just— it never happened, and I can’t as the DM, say, “Well maybe should go… check in with Conners some more…” It’s fucking hard to DM a mystery!
{21:45 - Q5: Mini-arc Reception}
Justin: I want to— we’re going to pick up the pace on questions. I’m just going to hit you guys with some. I’m going to wrest control from you. This question is for each of you, it’s from Laura. That last one— the question’s for each of you, and I would like to know, “What has surprised you most about the response to these mini-arcs?” And that’s from Laura.
Travis: I will just say, for Dust, I was sure that because it was, like, someone’s been murdered and somebody’s life is on the line, that it would— I was worried that it was going to be too serious and dark. And I think that it did skew that way a little bit, but overall, everybody was talking about the funny parts of it. And I do think that it has to do with, like, when you have a more serious story, I think the funny moments stand out a lot more.
Griffin: Yeah, especially when we did the setup episode, we saw a lot of people saying like, “Why the fuck are they trying to make it serious? Like, this is a comedy show.” But in my opinion, the— your, y’all’s vamping on my throwing the gun at the bell— that was fucking hysterical to me, and— this is, we have another question that we can answer, in a few seconds, of somebody talking about this, like— and this, we got this a lot, of just like, balancing… is it a comedy show now? It’s getting more dramatic… and I really… and this is maybe me getting defensive, but like, I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive.
The show has certainly gotten more dramatic and I’ve felt this since we’ve been doing the adaptation of Here There Be Gerblins, where there weren’t any, other than Phandalin’s destruction, and then you guys immediately going right back to, like, goofy goof goof goof, despite the fact that this horrible horrible thing had just happened— there weren’t that many dramatic beats, and I feel like adding those to the show has really made it something cool, and I think a lot more people have kind of found the show because of those things. But I don’t think that means that we can’t do funny shit anymore. And I don’t necessarily think that’s—
Justin: I do.
Griffin: —true of the arcs. Oh, okay.
Justin: Sorry. I meant to tell you guys, it’s all— I don’t know, man, it’s salt and pepper, baby. It’s salt and pepper. You gotta have them both. You got both those flavors, they highlight and balance each other. Dad, what has surprised you most about the response to the mini-arcs?
Clint: Gosh. I have loved how people have embraced the characters. I knew they would, but—
Travis: Whoa, Mr. Confident over here.
Clint: Well, I mean, I knew that, because, I think, one of the things that you guys bring to it is… is creating very compelling characters…
Travis: You too, Daddy! You also brang it!
Clint: I was basically thinking about Commitment— I loved the fact that Griffin got to be a character. I thought that was pretty cool. And just, everybody’s response was just, was so… so great, because—
Justin: Now, not everybody. Now you say everybody— words have meanings.
Griffin: No, stop. My contradicting thing is, we had a lot of people who were very vocal about how we were following the rules or not following the rules of D&D, and I really don’t think we got any of that, literally none of that, when we were doing these arcs. And I was genuinely worried about that, because we were trying to learn and play a bunch of different games, and I think folks were like, way cooler about how we played these games than I expected. And I really appreciate it.
Travis: I will also just say, like— talking about the learning experience of the arcs, I think, as Justin pointed out going into Commitment, we had all this time to work on our characters. And so I think when we started Commitment, we were— it was almost like a rebound relationship, right, after Balance, where we wanted to start at the same point we were, you know, when we finished Balance. We wanted to start with everybody knowing everything about our characters? And so I remember in the setup episode, like, and this person did— and they went to school here— and they learned this— and this is the relationship they have with their parents— and like, it was, we were really trying to start off—
Griffin: We did too much. We did too much setup in Commitment. I think by the time we, even by the time we got to Amnesty, because this is another question we got, of, because, this is something we talked about in the last The The Adventure Zone Zone we did at Podcon, of just making characters but leaving gaps… I, as somebody who is like, who after we finished Amnesty— and by the way, it has been so good to have this huge break between the first chunk of Amnesty and where we are now, because y’all gave me, like, so much shit to work with, with the characters that you made, and the enormous, enormous narrative gaps— teasing out, like, Ned inherited the Cryptonomica, and was a criminal who, something went south, and now is living on the lam— and it’s like, well, that’s so much shit for me to work with. And Duck having this history of him walking away from his destiny but not really dialing into what that was, or what that meant, and Aubrey having these magic powers that we haven’t expl— like, that is so much shit to work on, and so I don’t think we went as hard in Amnesty as we definitely all did in Commitment, where it was like, “Well, their favorite food is spaghetti…”
{26:52 - Favorite Characters}
Justin: Alright, you guys, you’re gonna have to—
Griffin: Wait, real quick— before we do that— because this is associated. I want to know everybody’s favorite character that you played in the mini-arcs.
Travis: Huh.
Griffin: Mine was Errol, with a bullet, man. I really liked [crosstalk]
Travis: I think mine is Aubrey. Honestly, it’s… I just, I love wizards and stuff… and I also, when I was thinking about Aubrey, based her off of some of my favorite people in the world, like, some of my best friends, and so that’s super fun for me. But it also is like… I like how much I don’t know about her, when we started, and like… it was very interesting because like the first time I spoke as Aubrey, I didn’t know what the voice was going to be, and then I started talking, and the voice has informed so much about her to me? It’s just really interesting, it’s fun.
Justin: Yeah, my… Kardala, I think was probably the best character because it’s one I worked on the hardest, but it was also the scariest to do because it was way out of my lane, and I was trying to work with a lot of stuff that I took very seriously and didn’t want to fuck up. So that was very hard, but I think Kardala came out the best. Augustus was probably the most fun to play, but I choked with Augustus. I really wanted to make a character that wasn’t a good person, wasn’t a bad guy, and once I started talking, that fucking Savannah accent, I couldn’t not make him, like, a charming dude. And I really fucked that up. Like, I really did want to be… I had intent of being a worse person. I really did. It was like, it just, I messed it up. And I still regret that. If we return to Dust, maybe I’ll try to make him more of a scumbag. I don’t know.
Griffin: Dad. Ned?
Clint: I loved playing Ned. I love Ned to pieces. I just had the best time. I liked his personality. And like Travis, and I think Griffin, for Commitment, and for Dust, I did a lot of— I had a big backstory for him that I didn’t use, that I still think will still apply, and really pumped up about it.
Griffin: And that is something that we didn’t do until like, fucking, Stolen Century— or, no, I didn’t get into y’all’s backstories in Balance until the… going inside the Chalice episode of Balance. Which was fucking 50 episodes in. And so, having the opportunity— and that’s why I was excited to start over knowing what we know now.
Clint: I want to say one thing. About the characters, and stuff. The… what people don’t understand is, like, what Justin’s talking about… it’s really tough to play a character with those negative aspects. I mean, it was— it was tough for Travis, Travis may not admit it, but it was tough for him to play Nadiya, in the fact that she had to be aloof, and she had to be, you know, kind of standoffish—
Travis: Yes, because I like playing with y’all, so it was really hard to be a jerk, you know.
Clint: It’s really tough to play a character like that. Because I had— I really thought about that with Gandy, you know, but it just doesn’t work—
Travis: That was all of Dust, like, people have commented on, “I thought Travis said it was going to be all tense and no one was going to like each other”… and it’s like, yeah, but then we got, you know, a good example of this is like— [crosstalk]
Griffin: But we do, we do like each other.
Travis: Yeah.
Griffin: Quite a bit, yeah.
Travis: At the Full Moon Saloon, like, you guys were so funny and charming, it made no sense for me to have characters just straight up not like you for no reason. [crosstalk: agreement]
Clint: And that also harkens back to the length of the mini-arcs, and the fact that, you know, in Balance, it developed over a natural period, you know, and really going back and looking at the graphic novel and stuff, I can see— because they, you know, they developed that trust, and that really— we had to jump in media res in the mini-arcs, and that kind of puts more of a time pressure on you.
{31:00 - Ned and Gravity Falls}
Justin: Dad, real quick: were you— before you created Ned Chicane, would you say you were, like, the biggest Gravity Falls fan, or were you just like, are you like the second biggest? You just love Gravity Falls so much? [crosstalk] When you created…
Clint: I had watched… I had watched Gravity Falls one time with your oldest daughter. And with my hand over my heart, I had no idea who Grunkle Stan was from Gravity Falls. And I saw the reaction—
Griffin: Bing bing-bing-bing bing-bing-bing! That’s all the tweets we’re getting right now. Bing bing bing bing bing—
Clint: But, and I will tell you this, and I appreciate it, and I’ve also had so many people say, you gotta watch it, you gotta see… but I really knew from the get-go that something more was going on with Amnesty, I knew. So no, I have not gone back and watched Gravity Falls. [crosstalk]
Travis: Yet!
Clint: For the very reason!
Griffin: There’s a— it— it’s a great show. I’ve seen like, a few episodes, I think…
Justin: I’ve seen, like, it fucking all, it’s the bomb. It’s a good show.
Griffin: It can be demoralizing, a little bit, and I hope that you, if you tweeted something like this, don’t take this personally or anything, but like, when you’re making something, it can be demoralizing that it seems like there’s an impulse to… connect it to something familiar, and I think there are definitely similarities. I mean, fucking Gravity Falls has a rural town with monsters, and then there’s like a shop where there’s a person peddling bullshit, or whatever, yeah, there’s definitely similarities, I’m not ignoring that, but it’s a little bit demoralizing when we did the setup episode and then… I think there’s a difference between saying, like, “This reminds me of Gravity Falls” and then… or, like, “This is… oh, you guys are doing Gravity Falls.” And “Oh, Ned reminds me of Grunkle Stan” and “Ned is Grunkle Stan.” It feels like, “Oh, well, I’ve seen this before.” And I know that’s not how it’s meant, but it’s a question of, like, volume… because Dad got literally hundreds of tweets when we did the setup episode, saying, like, “Oh, this is this character.”
Justin: Yeah, we got a fevered text from Dad, like, “Who the fuck is Grunkle Stan?” [crosstalk, Clint laughing]
Griffin: I hope this is not sounding like us being too sensitive, it’s just at the scale at which we were getting feedback, that was essentially, “This character is this character…” [crosstalk]
Justin: [Crosstalk] Yeah, whatever, we’re not here to police y’all’s tweets, we’re big boys, you tweet what you want. You tweet what’s in your heart, we can handle it.
Travis: No, but what we are here to do, is we are here to A: answer questions, and— [crosstalk]
Justin: Right reasons! Right reasons!
Travis: —talk about Bachelor Nation? [crosstalk]
Griffin: I don’t, why are we— I have explicitly moved away from Bachelor Nation, I don’t want to necessarily re— [crosstalk]
Justin: Griffin, those are our fans! The Bachelor Nation’s been supporting The Adventure Zone since its inception and I want to speak to Bachelor Nation, the fans of The Adventure Zone!
Griffin: Okay.
Travis: Griffin, I want you to know, I voted for Zoner Boners. And Justin chose—
{33:59 - Max Fun Drive}
Griffin: Alright, Bachelor Nation is way better, yeah. So it’s the MaxFun Drive. We’re asking you if you enjoy our show, if you’ve been listening to a lot of it, and feel like you want to help support us, this is the best time of year for you to do that by going to MaximumFun.org/donate and becoming a member, and picking the donation level that’s right for you. If you do not have the means right now, totally totally understand. We would never ask you to make a contribution that you could not afford, definitely, totally. But if you do have the means and you enjoy our show and you want to think about it like a Netflix or a Hulu, where you get your entertainment and you pay for it on a monthly basis, then we would encourage you to maybe think about doing the same here, or for The Adventure Zone. [crosstalk] If you listen to a bunch of shows on the network, like MBMBaM, and other shows, then, you know, maybe it makes more sense for you.
Justin: We’re about to indulge in my favorite MaxFun Drive tradition, since we’ve started The Adventure Zone. It’s where Dad reads the gifts that you can get, in his fun voice that he does every year.
Travis: Just stretch those cords and get a-rolling.
Justin: Just get it rolling. Take a break here.
Clint: All right! 2018, well, for $5 a month of course you get the exclusive bonus content. For $10 a month—
Justin: [Shock jock radio DJ voice] Now usually you do this guy, and that’s what’s good— [crosstalk]
Griffin: [Also exaggerated] Usually you try to sell the gifts a little bit more than just sayin’ what they are!
Clint: [Faster] We got $10 a month, that’s gonna getcha a Drive exclusive enamel pin, that’s designed by Megan Lynn Kott, and these are brand new designs! Holy cow, that’s awesome, and they’re really beautiful! [Laughter] For $20— [crosstalk]
Griffin: —does it fucking look like?
Travis: Yeah, I need you to describe the pin, please.
Clint: The pin for TAZ?
Travis: Yes.
Griffin: Yeah! The show we’re currently recording!
Clint: I just don’t see a pin for— [crosstalk]
Travis: It’s Dr. Harris Bonkers with a little flame in front of a starry sky— [crosstalk]
Clint: Oh, that’s why it was a rabbit!
Travis: —yes, Dr. Harris Bonkers, Ph.D.
Clint: Okay. All right. It’s beautiful. The MBMBaM’s good too.
Travis: It’s all right.
Griffin: Also, at every level that you move up, you get everything in the previous levels, so at $10, you also get the bonus content. [crosstalk]
Justin: I think Still Buffering has the best one. I don’t know if you guys looked at all the designs…
Griffin: Don’t hate! Why you hatin’?
Justin: It’s like a Dummies book, and it says “How to Adult”— it’s great. Anyway, that’s just my personal opinion. [crosstalk]
Travis: Well, I think Schmanners is the best one. [Blows a raspberry]
Justin: $20 a month!
Clint: $20 a month, you get the MaxFun Family Cookbook—
Justin: Um, where’s my guy?
Travis: Character voice?
Justin: Yeah, character voice?
Clint: [Exaggerated] For $20 a month, you get the MaxFun Family Cookbook! It is lovingly created for you by MaxFun hosts! This book contains dozens of recipes, from cocktails to desserts, and everything in between! Plus, a bonus set of handsome space-themed cookie cutters! [Normal voice] I also would like to add in my normal voice that we actually contributed to the MaxFun Family Cookbook, because Spaghettageddon is in there, with the recipe— [crosstalk, laughter]
Griffin: Is it?
Clint: Yeah!
Travis: Is the recipe just, like, a lot of spaghetti?
Griffin: Just too much spaghetti?
Clint: No! Carol actually— Carol put down the recipe for the sauce, I filled in a little bit of backstory on spaghettageddon, but if you want to make the same spaghetti that was served up in Spaghettageddon, almost killing three men… then, that’s in the cookbook.
Justin: That’s the spaghetti that fueled that gross Willy Wonka bit— [crosstalk]
Travis: Episode 55.
Justin: Episode 55. And also— guys, still resting on those laurels, 345 episodes later, man. Hachi machi.
Griffin: Jesus Christ.
Justin: And then— the Maximum Fun— [crosstalk]
Clint: [Exaggerated] $35 a month!
Justin: —okay… it also has our mom’s recipe for chess bars that I lovingly transcribed.
Clint: Did you really?
Justin: Yes. It’s in there.
Griffin: It also has Rachel’s recipe for chili! [crosstalk] There’s a lot of good stuff in there.
Travis: Oh, no, did Teresa and I— are we the only ones that didn’t put one— [crosstalk]
Clint: Nobody— [crosstalk]
Travis: We really meant to. Oh no.
Griffin: There’s higher levels too, that… as much as I love Dad’s voice, we don’t need to hammer into you, because we’ve got a ton of questions. If you’re able to support us at that level, holy shit, thank you all so much. But we don’t really care what level you’re able to support us at. All that we care about is that you show your support, and… we’re trying to get to 25,000 new and upgrading members, so—
Travis: And we want to hit “upgrading” there, because we haven’t mentioned that yet, but like— if you’ve been a donor, a member for a while, and you’re like, “You know what? I’m listening to even more shows this year, or, the shows that I’ve listened to have become even more important to me this year,” maybe consider upping that donation to the next level. We really appreciate it.
Griffin: And you’ll get the gifts, too, if you do that. So—
Justin: Yeah, that’s how you get the gifts. You gotta upgrade or become a new member.
Griffin: It means a lot to us to, and it has meant a lot to us, the way that you all have supported us, and allowed us to turn this into a career. Dad got to retire from the radio station last year, because of the money that you all give us to make this show. And that is so incredible, and one of, I feel like, our proudest achievements is that we were able to get our Dad out of this, uh, job that was not so great for him anymore— [Clint laughing] —but also, like—
Justin: Just because of the hours, and he’s so old. You know— [crosstalk: chorusing “he’s so old”]
Griffin: But, but also like, it’s cool for y’all too, because you get to feel this sense of… like you’re a part of the show every time you listen to it. You know that you have directly supported it, and that’s a really cool part of the network. So yeah, go to MaximumFun.org/donate now, don’t wait. Tell a friend, tweet about the show— the Drive, using the hashtag #MaxFunDrive, and thank you all so much!
Justin: We are going to get through more questions. Time to get serious about questions. I’m taking the wheel away from you guys, I’m steering us to more questions.
Clint: [sings] Justin, take the wheel!
{39:43 - Q6: Fantasy Costco 2}
Justin: Okay. “Will Season 2 have an equivalent to Magical Costco where fans can submit content? Please be monsters, I want to submit monsters.” And that’s from Kyle.
Griffin: I don’t know. I’m definitely going to keep doing the, tweet about the show using the #TheZoneCast hashtag, you’ll end up as a character in the show, like, that’s for sure going to be a part of it. Um… all of the games we did in the— like, Powered by the Apocalypse games— are not so necessarily built around having a huge inventory of magical items, right, they’re more based around what your characters can do, and sort of more realistic— not more realistic, but more sort of person-to-person interactions based on, like, what your basic set of abilities are? And so like, I don’t really know how I would fit this in. But for what it’s worth, y’all motherfuckers went, like, 50 episodes without using any of the shit that you bought at the Fantasy Costco— [crosstalk, Clint laughing loudly] or from the Fantasy Gashapon, so…
Clint: What about Cryptonomica, they— could they put, could they suggest things for Cryptonomica?
Griffin: Ooh, that could be good! Yeah! Things that could appear in the Cryptonomica! That wouldn’t necessarily be items that you all use, but just sort of like, flavor every time you’re in the Cryptonomica, we can highlight, like, something that somebody pointed out…
{40:43 - Q7: Mini-Arc Music}
Justin: “My question is directed at Griffin. I was wondering if you could talk about the music of the mini-arcs. Was it harder to find the sound for each arc, given the short time frame of each story? How was that process different from the Balance arc?” And that’s from Heidi. And I’m assuming that’s directed at both of us who have crafted all the music [Griffin laughing] of Adventure Zone together…
Griffin: There was another— there’s another question on the list of somebody asking if everybody else had thought about making music for their arcs, because they thought that it added something to the show. I really regret not— I had a bunch of music for Amnesty, but I wasn’t able to, like, crank out a bunch of music for everybody’s arcs, other than the themes, and that was because one, because we were doing weekly, y’all, our fucking recording schedule was always— always, every week, week in, week out, down to the wire. And so I didn’t know what was going to be happening in each episode, because I wasn’t the one writing it or preparing it. And so there was just literally, there was not enough time to record music for it. But I do think it’s an important part of the show. Now Justin, how did you land on Elementary’s theme? What was the major inspiration— [crosstalk]
Justin: You know what, Griffin, it came to me. It just… honestly, the main theme just came to me, and I recorded it with my mouth to remember it. And then, I was like, I don’t know how to play specific notes on any instrument other than the baritone, and so I guess I should just stick with this. So then I laid down the bass, and the horns—
Clint: It’s all about that bass.
Justin: And the— thank you, Papa— and then the drums, and then it was like… perfect. [Laughing] You know what I mean? So I was like—
Griffin: That’s music, baby!
Justin: That’s music! That’s just, you put them together, and—
Travis: And just believe you me, to answer that question: nobody wants me to try to make music for anything. That is not… hey, that’s not, I got a lot of skills, people, I got a lot of skills. That ain’t one.
Justin: Didn’t stop me! Just kinda went with it.
Griffin: It was really hard to find a sound for all the arcs, really. Amnesty was maybe a little bit easier because I had the, like, I knew, I had known for so long what that show was going to be, and so it was a little bit easier, but Dust, writing kind of a darker Western theme took me forever. And then writing Commitment, I like the theme that we have for Commitment, but I don’t think it was necessarily what fit the best for the genre, and I don’t necessarily think it’s what maybe Dad even had in mind for the genre.
It is really, really— Dad [laughing] Dad, I love you, Dad, this is not me knocking you, but you texted me one day saying “Could you write me like a John Williams-esque sort of music stinger to include?” [Clint laughs] And I was like, “Yeah, Dad, I’ll just—” I have no idea really how to compose orchestral music at all, and that’s kind of what these themes are, and so doing like a brass-focused orchestral theme for the show, it took me, you know— the whole break that we had between Balance and Commitment, I was working on the theme for Commitment, and I’m still just kind of okay with how it turned out. It was really hard.
Clint: Well, I got a DropMix game, so that’s how I’m gonna be composing music. [crosstalk]
Justin: Perfect. Perfect!
Griffin: Fuck yes.
{44:06 - Q8 and 9: Season 2}
Justin: “Will the story of Season 2 take off right where the introduction story ended?” That’s from Paul.
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Cool.
Justin: “Did you guys debate a lot on the choosing of Season 2? Did you consider doing any of the other arcs besides Amnesty for Season 2? Griffin, are you excited to be a DM,” I guess, GM, now, technically…
Clint: That’s actually three questions.
Justin: Emily, you got three in, Emily.
Travis: Let me answer real quick as far— from the point of view of Dust— writing a mystery with different sections, and I will continue Dust as like a mystery procedural— is not something I could do consistently every two weeks for any length of time. Like, it was, even just doing it for four weeks was pretty nerve-wracking for me, because running into, one: having to think of the stuff ahead of time, know how everyone was connected, what piece of information everybody knew, where they could be found, what time they would be awake, when they could give the piece of information, who they would give the piece of information too, and not revealing so much information that it was super obvious what was going on, but revealing enough information that when it was revealed, you could kind of say, like, “Oh, I can see—” right, like… that is not, I could not maintain that consistently week after week.
Griffin: Well, it’s not just that. The conversation that we had, and let’s just be completely fucking transparent here… after we had finished Amnesty, we all had a conversation about, let’s do— let’s do that. Because that was— we had so much fun, and it was the first time— there was so much fear that after we finished Balance that we would never be able to do anything that felt similar to Balance ever ever again. There was so much anxiety around… around that conversation. And then when we finished Amnesty, we all kind of felt like… “Okay, that felt like The Adventure Zone, so let’s do that.” And then a couple of episodes into Dust, we were like, “Okay, wait, this is really fucking good too, and we’re really enjoying that…” and the conversation that Travis had with us was that you didn’t necessarily have a whole campaign— [crosstalk] You didn’t have a whole campaign, and didn’t know how to really do a whole campaign.
Travis: That’s the thing. I could do miniseries of it. You know what I mean? Like that’s the thing. But I didn’t have an overarching big bad, or overarching, like, “This is where I’m trying to get to, with the story, to save all…” no. I like doing miniseries of it. And so that was really what it came down to, when we started talking about generating stuff for the off week, is… you know, I set up at the end of this one that the next one is them, like, going to, you know, Crescent City and bringing back the Blackwell daughter. Right? But that isn’t— to save the world or anything, like, I just want to write that. But—
Griffin: It doesn’t have to be that. [crosstalk] Not every story has to be about saving the world, right.
Travis: But that’s the thing, is like, I want to write these episodic encapsulations, right. But I also need— it took me like basically a year and a half to get to this, to know how this— and even that was like, two weeks before we started Dust was like, “Oh! Oh yeah, well they have to do this—” and so I don’t know that I could generate it consistently, you know what I mean? So I didn’t want to. Plus, I love playing. I like being a PC.
Griffin: It was a conversation, though. There was, again, a very small number of people who— there was this sort of perception that I, like, strong-armed everybody into doing my game? And that was super… that’s like… the reason that bums me out is because that’s not our fucking family dynamic. Like, that’s not— and so when folks were saying stuff like that, it bummed me out, because it made me think that they thought that that was how our, like, family works? And it’s super not.
Justin: I think, I mean, if anybody strong-armed, it was me. And I’ll take, sort of ownership of my role in that. Like, I— and I don’t regret it, but my personal feeling was that no matter how good the other arcs were, I feel like we built The Adventure Zone with the dynamic of Griffin running it, and the three of us playing, and for me, it’s not just about— you gotta remember, y’all, it’s like— it’s not just about one of us doing the story, it’s about what that dynamic is.
It is a very different dynamic of Travis running the game, and the three of us playing. It’s three different people playing the game. And that’s a very different— like, game rules and storyline aside, that’s a very different dynamic. Which is something that I didn’t realize ‘till we went into it. So like, for me, I was pushing from, I think from the— I think even before we did Amnesty. And it worked out that like, Amnesty was good, and it was a good rule set, but I felt really strongly that when we return to a main season, it should be Griffin running it, because that was— what we built Balance on, and that felt like the permutation of the show that we had worked for years to create. And so, yeah, like—
Griffin: That said, though, like, after Amnesty wraps up— which, real quick, another question that we got is like, “How long is it going to go?” And the answer is, not as long as Balance. Like, probably half as long as Balance? It’s still telling a big, cool story, just not taking three years to do so. And when we do the next experimental games, I think we’re all going to be at a place of comfort that— you would think we’d be there since doing this show since fucking 2014— where I would love to play and not DM it. I would— that’s— what Justin said is not indicative of, like, I’m always going to be the one running the game. Because I would fucking adore the chance— you ask if I’m excited to be DM, and the answer is yes, because I’m excited to tell this story. But it is not, a, like— it ain’t a fucking power trip thing, as much as people believe it is.
Justin: I think that the next time around… after this one, I’m going to be real ready. After this one. I’m gonna be, like, sooo ready to— GM, is that it? [crosstalk: yeah!] GM one of them, as they say. Just GM one out. You know? As they say.
{50:28 - Q10: Inspiration}
Justin: “Hello McElroys, I have a question for Griffin and Travis. Clint too, but I believe he discussed this in Commitment. And also Justin.” [laughter] “What inspired the narratives of Amnesty and Dust? And also while I’m thinking about it, Elementary? Thanks, Cherry K.”
Clint: And Commitment.
Justin: And Commit— he already, that’s [crosstalk]
Griffin: You were very forward about, like, what Commitment was based on, in the setup.
Justin: We did, if you’ll remember, we actually did one of these after we did Commitment.
Griffin: Oh, that’s right!
Justin: Yeah. So we’ve talked about a lot of this from the Commitment perspective. So, hey, us three storytellers, what inspired sort of our stories?
Travis: For Dust… a lot of disparate elements. One, and I’ve mentioned it a lot, is procedurals, mysteries, I really do love, the cheesier the better, like, Psych, and CSI, and Monk, and really cheesy detective procedurals. I just enjoy those immensely. But I also really like Westerns. I mean, my favorite movie is Blazing Saddles. So actually, Wilder is named after Gene Wilder, and I based him off of Anal Johnson, the bartender in Rock Ridge. And so, like, a lot of Blazing Saddles showed up in there. But the number one inspiration was Romeo and Juliet.
Griffin: Whoa.
Travis: That was kind of…
Griffin: Yeah, that tracks.
Travis: And that came actually fairly late. Like, it went through a lot of different iterations for me, but when I struck into a Shakespearean dynamic in the town of the families, and, generational differences between the parents and the children, and like, that kind of thing, that’s when it really all started to click for me. And one of the questions we got, and I don’t think we’re going to be able to get to it, but somebody asked me, like, how old Ann is… and it’s interesting, right, because when I was thinking about these characters, all I thought about was— there are— a parent generation and an offspring generation, and how different those interact with each other, right. And so I don’t really know that I have ages— I mean, everyone’s of age, whatever that means to you. I mean, 18 or older, in my head. There— I had so much shit, like, backstory and relationships and, you know, all this stuff written for Dust that I never got to.
Griffin: That’s true of all of them. My biggest inspiration, I mean, in some part is the supernatural dramas like Supernatural and Buffy and stuff like that, but way bigger than that, the original inspiration was Persona. This idea of living in a town that you try to flesh out as much as any other character, which is something I want to do more of with Kepler. But having sort of this secret adventure that nobody else knows about, that is going on at night, right, like the Dark Hour, or the Midnight Channel, and having this sort of home base where everybody can just sort of be, and have it be a nice place that you can hang out in, while doing this sort of secret battle against the forces of darkness. Like, I’ve always loved that shit, and so that was the biggest inspiration.
Clint: And Justin, what was your inspiration for Elementary?
Justin: Oh, God, Dad, so many. Um… uh…
Clint: Because you had Sherlock Holmes, and you had the vampire— [crosstalk]
Justin: Place Beyond the Pines. Call Me By Your Name. Shape of Water. Uh, Spotlight. [Laughing] Amadeus. Uh, Million Dollar Baby. Hurt Locker. 12 Years a Slave. Birdman.
Clint: Are you just running through your Netflix queue?
Justin: Spotlight.
Griffin: I’m pretty sure he’s looking at the Best Picture winners.
Justin: No, just, there’s like so many different influences, it’s like, hard to— no, I said I was going to do the greatest detective story ever, and I did a story about the greatest detective ever. [Travis: You fucking nailed it.] So I fucking completed my mission. [Griffin: Mission accomplished] Mission accomplished. [Justin clears his throat.] I start to get panicky… it starts to, like, actually make me kind of nauseous when we talk about the things we do for too long, because I start to feel very navel-gazey. [crosstalk]
Griffin: Yes.
Travis: Oh, I love it.
{54:55 - Final Small Questions}
Justin: It shows. Um… [Clint laughs] “How… has leading a game changed how you approach, how you run your player characters, and how you interact with the other players and” the gym— no, “the GM.” That’s from Conor.
Griffin: And the gym.
Travis: And the gym.
Justin: And the gym. [crosstalk]
Clint: I can answer this! I’m not going to fuck with the DM and the GM— [crosstalk]
Travis: Oh, I am. I absolutely am. [crosstalk]
Griffin: Well, that’s good stuff, no, you definitely should keep doing that. Yeah.
Clint: But still, not as much. Not as much.
Travis: The scene where Errol just wouldn’t fucking go with Ellis and Blackwood to go talk to the Banshee… that’s… hey, why did the, why did we all start riffing after Griffin rang the bell? It’s because I was punishing Griffin for not just going with Ellis and Blackwood. One of the things that I am going to come away, is not try to plan too much ahead, for— because this is a thing that happens a lot, where we finish a recording and then I spend the next two weeks thinking about [what] the next thing I’m going to do as my character is, right, but that’s not really how the collaborative story-building process works. So it’s easier just to play in the moment rather than as the player-character try to think about, like, the next three scenes you want to do.
Griffin: Let’s move on. This is a question from Katya, who says, “I have a very important question to Travis about Aubrey Little. Is she a lesbian?”
Travis: So… when I talked about— I based Aubrey on four people, right. She’s named after Aubrey Plaza, and she is pierced and tattooed like my friends Verona, Tybee and Kate, right, and so all four of those people are bisexual. And so it was just kind of in my head when I— it wasn’t even really a decision that I made, but as I was picturing Aubrey and basing her off of these four people, that she just was bisexual. So to answer your question, Katya, she is bisexual, like all four of those people.
Griffin: Here’s a question from Trevor who says, “I’m a big fan of regional storytelling and I was wondering, given that this arc is set in West Virginia, do you see this season as an opportunity to tell stories about West Virginia in a positive light, or at least not in a negative light?” Uh, yes. That’s very important to me.
Travis: Yes, yes, yes yes.
Griffin: I thought that’d be very cool. To, like, tell a story about people living in West Virginia, that is not the same fucking three stories that people have told about living in West Virginia over and over and over again. Um, what else is on here?
Travis: “This question is for Griffin. How did it feel to be hands-off for the setup of the last battle in Amnesty? Are you nervous about this going forward?” And that’s from Rosalin.
Griffin: I’m not nervous, I thought that was great. And that’s, like, one really cool thing about Monster of the Week that I think is going to continue to be very very cool… is that, the like, final confrontation is, at least how I led the game, not going to be something that I come up with at all. The whole battle of y’all being in a cave and doing the fire trap and all that stuff was completely not anything that I had made up. So… and I thought that was really neat, and I think that you all, it’s a cool way for you all to come up with, like, what the climactic moment of each arc is going to be. And so I’m super excited about that.
{58:12 - Wrap-up}
Travis: Well, awesome! So we’re going to wrap up, but first I want to remind everybody one more time, it’s the MaxFun Drive, and it’s your opportunity to support the art and artists you love. If you go the MaximumFun.org/donate, you can become a member. And what that means is, you pick a monthly donation level that you’re comfortable with, and here’s the amazing thing— and it really— ugh, that sounds like such a gross sales pitch, but here’s the thing I love the most about MaxFun. When you become a member and you make these pledges, it goes directly to the shows you listen to. You are asked which shows you listen to. And so a percentage, a small percentage goes to cover the overhead of MaxFun, so they can pay their employees. But the rest goes directly to the artists you like.
It’s not like some, you know, amorphous blob of, the money goes in, you have no idea where it goes. We have been able to, you know, focus on Adventure Zone and put as much work into it as we do because we know directly how many people care about it, and we know what it means to y’all and how much you support it. And so it’s an amazing system. I love the MaxFun Drive. And I love the Maximum Fun structure. And it means the world to us.
Griffin: We should also mention, like, it’s kind of a weird year for us at the Adventure Zone, doing the MaxFun Drive. Because we’re about to— we’re not doing the same show we’ve done for the past couple MaxFun Drives. And so I don’t know. Your support— I feel like now more than ever, would mean the world to us, and, you know, is a way of saying, like, we’re supportive of the thing that you’re making, whatever shape it takes. If you— again, if you have the means— we really appreciate it. It’s MaximumFun.org/donate is the link you can go to. Go do it now, and thank you all very very much.
Justin: Listen, I’m just going to say, because you guys won’t, if you all don’t keep supporting us, our Dad has to go back to work. And listen, y’all…
Clint: Yeah— I gotta start getting up at 3:30 in the morning again? Please!
[crosstalk: please, he’s so old, etc.]
Justin: That’s assuming you’d be able to get your old job back. There’s no reason to think that’s the case.
Griffin: He burned those dinks on his last day. Y’all have no idea.
Justin: Hey, listen, did you ever see Half Baked? It’s a good flick, check it out.
Griffin: This has been Justin’s cool flicks recommendations.
Justin: It’s a new segment I’m starting.
Griffin: New segment on The Adventure Zone, every episode. So next week, the second week of the MaxFun Drive, we will be doing the next episode of The Adventure Zone: Amnesty Episode 6, the first episode of a new arc. I’m very excited for you all to see what nasty monster I have cooked up for you this time.
Clint: Oh, that’s not the pirate one, then, right? We’re not doing the pirates. Not doing pirates.
Griffin: No. It is, actually, the monster is two pirates, um… it’s a new thing… yeah, so that’ll be next week, and then I think we’ll actually also have another episode the week after that, just to get us back on our biweekly schedule, and then from that point on, we’re back to biweekly, so that we can focus on making the show as good as we need it to be, without suffering from, sort of, soul-crushing time management issues.
Anything else here, as we’re sort of wrapping th— Again, thank you all so much for hanging with us during the experimental arcs, that was a, I understand that that was a lot to ask from you, the listener, and we’ve groused a little bit about some of the— again, very very small minority of the response that we got, but it really— you all stuck with us during a period of the show that we were all very very scared to enter into, and you all made it something that was not only, really, I think, at the end of the day, pretty enjoyable for all of us, but as we were hoping, like, really really really informative about how to do this show better and make the show what we want to make. [crosstalk]
Travis: I will also say, not to put too fine a point on it, but as we were finishing Balance, we were really worried that “What if,” you know— “What if people just liked Balance?” And then that was done? And so many of you have come out to be, like, “I like this too!” And it really does mean a lot to us. It has been wonderfully supportive, and we just appreciate— we appreciate it so much.
Clint: Yeah, you can’t put too fine a point on it. We got so much positive feedback about, about Dust and Amnesty and Commitment and Elementary—
Griffin: And constructive criticism. That was really helpful too.
Clint: Yeah. We take that in, and we really do— it’s extremely helpful, and I plan on going back to Commitment. I got some stuff planned, so…
Travis: Yeah, I didn’t get in—
Griffin: There’s future for all of them. I need more Elementary.
Justin: I actually didn’t get any critique about my thing. I didn’t get a single critique. So I guess it’s kind of perfect.
Travis: All positive?
Clint: Must have been.
Griffin: Yeah.
Justin: All positive. All positive. It’s, which is wild.
Griffin: You all need to become a donor, if only to hear Justin’s Elementary episode. It was the most fun we’ve ever had recording an episode, I feel like.
Justin: Okay!
Griffin: All right, let’s wrap up. Thank you all so much. Next week, the, I guess, season premiere? That’s a weird way of thinking about it, since we already did five episodes, but… April 12th!
Justin: That was a backdoor pilot!
Griffin: That was the backdoor pilot, and then, literally the day after that, we’re going to have a live show in Dallas, and— [various whistles] yeah, I think that one’s sold out, but we’re doing a whole—
Justin: Oh, hey, Houston, by the way? This is a MBMBaM show, but like, Houston, can you come to our show please?
Travis: Can you, like, step up, please?
Justin: Can you please buy some tickets? [crosstalk]
Travis: We want to do more shows than aren’t in, like, Boston and New York and San Francisco and stuff. So we need you, Houston— step up.
Clint: If we don’t— if we don’t sell out— [crosstalk]
Justin: I don’t know why Travis hates Boston and San Francisco so much. I love those towns. Listen, remember your hometown boy, Justin McElroy still loves those cities. Unlike Travis.
Clint: And if we don’t sell out, if we don’t sell out Houston, [sadly] I’m gonna have to go back to radio.
Justin: There it is, folks. You heard it here first. [crosstalk: Yeah. So old!]
Griffin: Okay. That’s it. McElroyshows.com/tours, if you want to see what the dates are, and tickets. And we’re also doing a book tour for the graphic novel, and there’s some tickets available for that too. Again, all at McElroyshows.com/tours. And MaximumFun.org/donate is where you go to become a member of the network. And we’ll see you all next week! Bye!
Justin: Bye y’all!
