"S1 E1: Well Met","INT. PALACE CHAMBERS, MORNIN:
PARABE:
Good morning, Millie.
MILLI:
Good morning to you, Your Majesty. Tea?
PARABE:
Yes, please.
MILLI:
Beautiful day out today.
PARABE:
The girls are off to their riding lessons?
MILLI:
Yes… though it took a bit of doing. Willemina is still unhappy they don’t have unicorns.
PARABE:
Well, Mummy and Daddy can’t afford unicorns this year. Where is Gunther, anyway?
MILLI:
His Majesty’s still in bed, I think.
SOUND: Wooden door opens
SOUND: Soft hissing
GUNTHE:
(emerging, sleepy)
No, I’m awake.
(yawns)
Or almost awake. I swear, it must be something in that tonic Alba gave me for my…
SOUND: Tea service crashes to the floor
MILLI:
(horrified)
Oh, my word! Your Majesty!
PARABE:
Millie… oh, do take better care. Look what you’ve—
(screams)
Gunther!
GUNTHE:
What? Parabel, what’s the matter?
PARABE:
Your hair! It’s all snakes! Look in the mirror!
SOUND: Snakelike hissing grows louder and louder
GUNTHE:
Oh, for heaven’s sake. Get Alba in here!
MUSIC: OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the First: Well Met.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
SOUND: Quiet bubbling, stirring
SOUND: Book page being turned
ALB:
(mumbling)
Grind and add seven leaves dried catnip. Is that per dose, or the whole cauldron?
SOUND: Door opens
JEROM:
Alba!
ALB:
Hi Jerome.
JEROM:
I wonder if you could help me out.
ALB:
(barely paying attention)
I’m a bit busy this afternoon…
JEROM:
Oh, I understand. This won’t take long… I’ve just been having a touch of the old rheumatism again.
ALB:
(sighs)
Mm hmm.
JEROM:
I was wondering, since you’re so good with potions and all, if you could mix up something.
ALB:
I’ve got three prescriptions to fill right now, Jerome.
JEROM:
Not to worry, I can wait.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
SOUND: Hooves clop in, then desk bell rings
ALB:
Excuse me a moment.
(to new patient)
Yes, can I help you?
VALTA:
Yes, I needs must see someone about my back.
ALB:
You’re in luck… our visiting chiropractor, Balthig the Ogre is in today. Have you seen him before?
VALTA:
No, I have not.
SOUND: Clipboard
ALB:
All right. You’ll need to fill out this patient information form.
VALTA:
(moving off)
Certainly.
SOUND: Hooves clop
JEROM:
Boy, a centaur. Don’t get many of them around, eh?
ALB:
(distracted)
No, we don’t.
JEROM:
So, you coming to the Palace tonight?
ALB:
The Palace?
JEROM:
To see the show. The Dragon Mountain Monks are in town to perform astonishing feats of acrobatics and martial arts!
ALB:
Nah, not interested. I really don’t need to see a bunch of bald weirdos jumping around and chopping firewood with their hands.
JEROM:
But Alba! They’re doing the Great Sword Dance. The Monks only perform it publicly every eight years.
ALB:
Yes. Very exciting. Seen it.
SOUND: Hooves approach
VALTA:
(wandering up)
Hold on, what’s this about a consultation fee?
ALB:
I’m afraid chiropractic isn’t covered for centaurs.
VALTA:
How is that fair?
ALB:
You’ve got twice the vertebrae and two ribcages.
VALTA:
It’s discrimination!
ALB:
I don’t set the prices. Take it up with Balthig. He’s right through there.
VALTA:
(wandering away again)
I believe I will.
SOUND: Hooves recede, interior door opens and shuts
ALB:
Where was I… one pennyweight of powdered parchment leaf. Bring to a boil…
SOUND: Stirring
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
KI:
(running in)
Albaaa! I have the hic hiccups!
ALB:
Do you really.
KI:
They’re terrible awful. How do I hic make them stop?
ALB:
That’s easy. Just stand on one foot…
KI:
Uh huh…
ALB:
No, the left one. That’s it. Now, give me your hand, and put out your pinky finger…
KI:
Like hic that?
ALB:
Just like that. Good. Now, hand me that big pair of shears.
KI:
These she—hic—shears?
SOUND: Slight clatter of shears, and the soft noise of the blades opening
ALB:
Hold still now… keep that finger out nice and straight…
KI:
No, wait wait wait!
ALB:
What is it?
KI:
They’re gone! The hiccups! They’re all gone!
ALB:
Are they? Well, that’s a relief. I guess you get to keep your finger then.
KI:
Whew!
ALB:
But if you ever have bad hiccups again, you just come and talk to me. Okay?
KI:
O—hic—okay.
ALB:
You sure they’re gone?
KI:
Totally gone! Um, th-thanks Alba!
ALB:
Don’t mention it.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
SOUND: Distant crunch
VALTA:
(from the other room)
Aaaaa!
BALTHI:
(from the other room)
Now other side, please.
JEROM:
Supposed to rain again tomorrow, I heard.
ALB:
Are you still here?
JEROM:
And the day after that. I dunno how they tell. D’you know how they tell? Being a witch and all?
ALB:
Jerome. I’m supposed to cure the ills of an entire kingdom here, and you are wasting my time.
JEROM:
Oh. Well… so, about my rheumatism…
ALB:
Yes. Yes, you’re right. Sorry. Here. Take this. Drink a mouthful with every meal. Don’t bug me any more.
JEROM:
Oh! Well, thank you kindly then.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
HERAL:
(entering)
Miss Alba Salix.
ALB:
(ready to snap)
Yes.
HERAL:
His Majesty the King requests your presence at the Palace.
ALB:
Oh?
HERAL:
‘Tis a matter of some secrecy, he says, and most urgent.
ALB:
Now what?
(sighs, then, leaving)
Tell him I’m on my way.
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
SOUND: Crunch
VALTA:
Aaaaaa!
SOUND: Interior door opens
SOUND: Hooves, unsteady
BALTHI:
All done.
VALTA:
(winded)
Yes, thank you, that’s much better.
BALTHI:
You pay now.
VALTA:
Yes, yes of course… Very, uh, very reasonable rates indeed.
SOUND: Largish bag of coins handed over
BALTHI:
Remember stretching. Take care bye bye.
INT. PALAC:
HERAL:
Miss Alba Salix to see you, Majesty.
GUNTHE:
Show her in. Hello, Alba.
SOUND: Door closes
ALB:
Hi Gunther… did you try out that hair tonic I gave you?
GUNTHE:
Yes, about that.
ALB:
What’s the towel for?
(proudly)
Washing your new head of hair, were you?
GUNTHE:
Look.
SOUND: Hissing and slithering
GUNTHE:
Notice anything different?
ALB:
Oh, um… well, yes, you have a lovely full head of, um…
GUNTHE:
Snakes.
ALB:
That’s the word I was looking for. How did this happen?
GUNTHE:
Clearly a result of your little tonic.
ALB:
Clearly not! There’s no way it could have caused anything like this.
GUNTHE:
Alba, what am I supposed to do now?
ALB:
Well, the… uh, serpentine look is very in this year. Gorgon chic, they’re calling it.
GUNTHE:
I will not live with snakes on my head. What if one of them bites me?
ALB:
Oh, they’re only garter snakes. They’re quite harmless.
GUNTHE:
Parabel won’t come near me. I can’t go out in public like this! And I was looking forward to the Dragon Mountain Monks show this evening, too.
ALB:
Yes. Sorry, Your Majesty. I’ll see what I can do.
GUNTHE:
And what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
ALB:
I’d keep the towel on. Snakes like the warmth.
EXT. PALACE GROUND:
MUSIC: Lute and cymbals, distant
SOUND: Rhythmically rustling robes, dozens of bare feet stamping
MONK:
(in the distance, synchronized)
Hyaaaaa—foo! Hah!
LAIN:
Good work, brothers. Let us take fifteen before we rehearse the second half.
MON:
Yes, Father.
MAGNU:
Father Laing! Can I show you my moves now?
LAIN:
Not now, Brother Magnus.
MAGNU:
But you promised to let me show you. I’ve been working hard!
LAIN:
Magnus…
MAGNU:
Please. I want to be a warrior-monk.
LAIN:
You are young still, and have not the proper energy and attitude to pursue the art of combat.
MAGNU:
But I wanna learn to kick through walls and kill people with just my eyelids. Why the hell else would I join your stupid order?
SOUND: Smack
MAGNU:
Ow! I mean why the heck.
LAIN:
You only prove my point.
MAGNU:
Okay, sorry, I renounce all worldly things and I promise to use my powers for good and I don’t have an ego and stuff. Can I be a warrior monk now?
LAIN:
Magnus, your skills lie in other areas. You have it in you to be an excellent healer.
MAGNU:
Stupid healing. Can’t you teach me, like, one secret pressure point? Like that one that makes your ribcage explode?
SOUND: Big door creaks, distant, and booted footsteps
LAIN:
Hush, boy.
(calling)
Miss Salix? Excuse me, are you Miss Alba Salix?
ALB:
(approaching)
That’s me.
LAIN:
A pleasure. I am Father Laing of the Order of Dragon Mountain.
ALB:
Nice to meet you. Look, is this going to take long? I’ve got an important matter to attend to on behalf of His Majesty—
LAIN:
I understand you are the head of the new House of Healing, and as such I wonder if you might have a place for a young man who shows great potential as a surgeon.
ALB:
A surgeon?
LAIN:
Yes. Permit me to introduce Brother Magnus.
MAGNU:
Are you a witch?
LAIN:
Magnus! This is Miss Alba Salix, the Royal Physician.
MAGNU:
A woman physician? You gotta be kidding.
ALB:
An apprentice? This kid?
MAGNU:
I’m seventeen. And I know martial arts.
ALB:
I can’t say he sounds of much use to anyone, let alone me.
LAIN:
He does have some skill, and he’s… got great potential.
ALB:
I don’t need any assistance.
MAGNU:
You heard the witch.
ALB:
I certainly don’t need him. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some herbs to gather.
INT. PALAC:
SOUND: Muffled hissing throughout
PARABE:
Gunther?
GUNTHE:
Yes, Parabel.
PARABE:
Did Alba get rid of the snakes?
GUNTHE:
She’s working on it. Though I may as well give in and get Krankel in here to have a look.
PARABE:
You said you weren’t going to ask him.
GUNTHE:
Well, what choice do I have?
PARABE:
Well… maybe I can help?
GUNTHE:
(skeptical)
What do you propose to do, dear?
PARABE:
Well, you know how I have mystical powers too…
GUNTHE:
Yes…
PARABE:
I am Alba’s sister, remember.
GUNTHE:
And do you know any snake-removal spells?
PARABE:
Well, not spells… I haven’t studied the way Alba has, of course, but if I concentrate, and picture you in my mind without the snakes…
GUNTHE:
Yes?
PARABE:
(nervously)
And then, um… if I kiss you…
GUNTHE:
You’ll have to come a bit closer for that, dear.
PARABE:
Uh huh!
(braces herself, then kisses him)
…Anything?
GUNTHE:
Not yet.
PARABE:
(disappointed)
Kissing always works.
GUNTHE:
Perhaps if you were to kiss each snake individually?
PARABE:
(squeamish)
Nnnghh…
GUNTHE:
Go ahead.
SOUND: Towel unwrapped, louder hissing
PARABE:
All right, here we go. Nghh…!
(tries mightily… then gives in)
Okay, you’d better summon Krankel.
EXP. MEADOW—DA:
SOUND: Birdsongs and other forest noises. Humming wings, like a dragonfly’s, zoom all about, and so does the voice of…
HOLL:
(singing)
Good morning, meadow, good day! You’re the loveliest meadow of all, I dare say…
(fading into the distance)
Hello, Mister Hedgehog! Hello, Bumblebees! Hello, daisies and blackbirds and sycamore trees…
SOUND: Footsteps through underbrush
ALB:
(approaching, from the other direction)
Snakeweed. Why can’t I find any snakeweed?
HOLL:
(approaching at top speed, still singing)
Swallowtail butterflies, grasshoppers too…
SOUND: Holly zooms in; thump of impact and crashing of bushes, clattering of bottles
ALB:
Augh!
HOLL:
Ooof!
(picking herself up)
Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t see you there.
ALB:
(winded)
Why don’t you watch where you’re flying?!
HOLL:
Here, let me help you with your basket… My name’s Holly, by the way.
ALB:
Bloody fairies! I can manage my basket just fine.
HOLL:
Oh, chokecherries. Are you making a liver tonic?
ALB:
No.
HOLL:
A poultice?
ALB:
No.
HOLL:
A charm against thieves?
ALB:
No, it’s for removing snakes from someone’s—who the hell are you, anyway?
HOLL:
Snakes? Ohh! Chokecherry doesn’t remove snakes, that’s just an old wives’ tale. Sorry! Didn’t mean it like that—being that you are, you know… um…
ALB:
An old wife?
HOLL:
I didn’t mean it like that…
ALB:
I’m neither, thank you very much. Now excuse me.
SOUND: Footsteps, followed a few seconds later by humming wings
HOLL:
You know what’s better for removing snakes, is silverbark.
ALB:
Did I ask?
HOLL:
(miffed)
It seemed like the best way to help you out. You know, to make amends for bumping into you and calling you an old wife—
ALB:
That’s very kind. I don’t need your help.
HOLL:
(flying away)
Fine!
(catches herself, and returns)
But really, you should try the silverbark. There’s a stand of it right over there.
ALB:
All the books I’ve ever read say chokecherry.
HOLL:
Who are you going to believe? A bunch of books, or an expert herbalist?
ALB:
Expert? You? You can’t even fly straight.
HOLL:
Well, that’s probably just the rainbow-cap angel mushrooms I was trying earlier. Seems like they mess with my sense of direction. I should make a note of that…
ALB:
Uh huh.
HOLL:
It’s my big research project, see. I’ve been working my way through the native fungi of Farlora, to find out their effects on fairy physiology.
ALB:
And suddenly all is explained.
HOLL:
Can’t I at least carry your basket or something?
ALB:
No thank you.
SOUND: Wings
HOLL:
Please? I need to do you a good deed to set things right. It’s what we fairies do. Here, let me. Let me!
ALB:
No! Let go, you. Don’t make me smack you!
HOLL:
It’s really nothing! I can always—
SOUND: Crack of wicker, crashing and clinking
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Oops.
(flying away)
Sorry sorry sorry!
SOUND: Wings receding
ALB:
Bloody fairies!
INT. PALAC:
HERAL:
The Sorceror General to see you, Majesty.
GUNTHE:
Krankel.
KRANKE:
Your Majesty.
GUNTHE:
Do you know anything about snakes? Removing them, I mean?
KRANKE:
Are they getting into the palace gardens again?
GUNTHE:
No. They’re on my head.
SOUND: Towel, hissing snakes
KRANKE:
Oh dear. And how did this come about? Let me guess—was it perhaps that “physician” of yours?
GUNTHE:
It was supposed to be a hair tonic…
KRANKE:
Oh dear me. How terrible.
GUNTHE:
Is there anything you can do?
KRANKE:
Mmm. It’s a tricky business, this. Do you have any more of the tonic, so-called?
GUNTHE:
Alba took the rest of the bottle.
KRANKE:
Hmm. Without being able to perform an analysis on this preparation, I will require more time to formulate a suitable remedy.
GUNTHE:
I hope you’re enjoying yourself, Krankel.
KRANKE:
Not at all, Majesty. But I did warn you, if I recall.
GUNTHE:
Yes, yes. Stop poking at my snakes.
KRANKE:
With respect, Majesty, it is a consequence of allowing, if I may be so bold, a self-taught hedge witch to minister to the health of yourself and the kingdom at large…
GUNTHE:
Thank you, Mister Krankel.
KRANKE:
Doctor Kra—
GUNTHE:
Doctor Krankel. Just look for a remedy, please.
KRANKE:
(leaving)
Of course, Majesty.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
SOUND: Bubbling and fizzing, spoon stirring metal pot
ALB:
…Two parts tincture of rosehip to three parts dragon scale oil. Reduce heat and add three leaves of cow parsnip… drat.
SOUND: Spoon set down
SOUND: Door creaks open
ALB:
You!
HOLL:
I have wronged you, Miss Alba Salix, and now I must—
ALB:
What are you doing in my pantry?
HOLL:
I must do three good deeds for you to set things right. Look! I brought you a new basket.
ALB:
How did you get in?
HOLL:
Um… through the window.
ALB:
Oh gods…
HOLL:
Yeah, sorry about that, by the way.
ALB:
You broke my window!
HOLL:
I know! I’m sorry! I’ll fix it. Okay, so that’s four good deeds. But look, I’ve been sorting your pantry. Look!
ALB:
You’ve been… Oh, great Ivar, what have you done? I had everything filed away…
HOLL:
It was a crazy jumble! I don’t know how you could ever find anything.
ALB:
There’s a system! I had a system. And now I’ve got about two minutes to come up with a potion for the King!
(sighs)
Cow parsnip… cow parsnip… look at this! They’re not even in alphabetical order.
HOLL:
No, see! Alphabetical doesn’t make sense. I mean, if you’re looking for cow parsnip, is that under C for cow or P for parsnip or H for Heracleum? (hare-a-CLEE-um)
ALB:
You tell me.
HOLL:
I’ve organized them all by their Glade-Miles Herbal Catalogue Number.
ALB:
Oh gods help me.
HOLL:
This is the eight hundreds, which is everything with a hollow stem… here’s your hemlock, fennel, parsley and look… cow parsnip! You want the greens or the flowers?
ALB:
Give me that!
HOLL:
You’re welcome!
ALB:
And put my shelves back the way they were.
HOLL:
But I have to do a good deed so that we can—
ALB:
Here’s your good deed. Put everything back, and then get out of my pantry.
HOLL:
Geez, okay, okay.
ALB:
If there’s one thing I don’t need, it’s more “help”.
SOUND: Door opens
GUNTHE:
(entering)
Alba, for heaven’s sake, I’ve got half an hour before I have to be back at the palace for the Monks’ show!
ALB:
There you are, Gunther! I was just, ah, finishing up the mixture… Here, get that towel off. Drink this.
SOUND: Towel removed, hissing of snakes
GUNTHE:
Thank heavens.
(drinks)
Ugh. How long will it take?
ALB:
It should be instantaneous.
SOUND: Continued hissing
GUNTHE:
Is there a particular instant you had in mind?
ALB:
Just give it a minute.
GUNTHE:
I don’t feel anything.
HOLL:
(entering)
Hey, Alba, what should I do with this pumpkin extract? Oh, hey! You look kind of like the King except with snakes on your head!
GUNTHE:
I am the King!
HOLL:
Oh! Well, in that case, hail, good King… uh…
ALB:
Gunther.
HOLL:
Gunther. King Gunther. I like the snakes!
GUNTHE:
I don’t!
ALB:
(mutters)
Damn, they’re not shifting…
HOLL:
(quietly)
I told you, silverbark…
ALB:
Well, I don’t have any!
HOLL:
Not to worry. I brought some from the meadow.
SOUND: Rustling leaves, then chopping and clinking
HOLL:
Look—just grind it up finely, squeeze out the juice into one cup pear cider vinegar…
GUNTHE:
Who is this person?
ALB:
Her name’s Holly. She’s… she’s an expert herbalist.
(mutters)
So she claims.
SOUND: Stirring, fizzing
HOLL:
A dash of nutmeg… and here you go.
GUNTHE:
(drinking)
Mm, actually not too bad. Oh my word! It’s working.
SOUND: Hissing and slithering, receding
HOLL:
Here, bend down quick.
ALB:
No, no, use the basket! Take them outside.
HOLL:
See? It’s the oils in the silverbark. They help the snakes’ tails grow out and detach from your head.
GUNTHE:
Dear me. I’ve never been so glad to be bald.
HOLL:
Bye, little snakes!
ALB:
Great. They’re all going under the furniture…
GUNTHE:
That’s the last of them. Thank heavens. I must get back to the Palace. Thank you—Holly, was it?
HOLL:
Any time, your Majesty!
GUNTHE:
Alba, I do hope you’re keeping her on.
ALB:
(under her breath)
No. I’m holding out for someone even more annoying.
SOUND: Door closes
HOLL:
What did I tell you?
ALB:
It was the chokecherry. A delayed reaction.
HOLL:
Was that a good deed or what?
ALB:
And now I have three dozen snakes living in my office.
HOLL:
Oh. Right. I can help with that. Hey… if they sprang from the King’s head, does that make them all princes and princesses?
ALB:
I don’t care. Chuck ’em out.
HOLL:
(to a snake)
Hi cutie. I’m gonna call you Princess Coily… and you, you look like a Tyrone…
ALB:
Holly. The basket.
HOLL:
Yes Ma’am!
INT. PALACE GROUNDS—STAGE TEN:
WALLA: Excited anticipation
MUSIC: Monkish accompaniment, dramatic
HERAL:
Your Royal Majesties! Ladies and Gentlemen. We proudly present, from the far Western Reaches, the warrior monks of the Order of Dragon Mountain!
WALLA: Applause
SOUND: Pounding footfalls and monks shouting
GUNTHE:
Impressive, aren’t they?
PARABE:
Mmm, I like that one.
GUNTHE:
Parabel!
PARABE:
You had your belly dancers last week.
GUNTHE:
You insisted they wear robes. Look, what do you call that?
PARABE:
It’s traditional garb.
GUNTHE:
It looks drafty.
PARABE:
That’s rich, coming from Mister “Ooo, the Sultan of Svangililand Has a Harem, Why Can’t I?”
GUNTHE:
I didn’t say that.
PARABE:
Oh yes you did.
GUNTHE:
Well, I didn’t say it like that.
KRANKE:
Your Majesties.
GUNTHE:
Krankel! What are you doing here?
KRANKE:
I have found a remedy for the snakes that have been plaguing your royal scalp… er… your snakes—what’s happened to them?
GUNTHE:
Alba took care of them.
KRANKE:
Did she?
GUNTHE:
Well, she and her fairy.
KRANKE:
Which fairy would this be?
PARABE:
If you please, Mister Krankel…
KRANKE:
Doctor Krankel.
PARABE:
…the show is about to start and you’re being most distracting.
GUNTHE:
Indeed.
KRANKE:
Yes, my apologies, Majesties. A good evening to you both.
(to himself)
A fairy, eh? Hmmm.
SOUND: Monks finale
WALLA: Applause
LAIN:
Your Majesties. We humbly offer you: the Golden Sunflower Head Slice Technique, demonstrated by Brother Coe and Brother Fang.
WALLA: Applause.
SOUND: Clashing swords and shouts
PARABE:
Ooh, that looks dangerous.
GUNTHE:
Nonsense… all those swords are blunted so no one gets hurt.
SOUND: Swish, chop and a clattering of lumber
WALLA: Gasps and applause
GUNTHE:
On the other hand…
MONK:
Hyah!
SOUND: Running footsteps, frantically whooshing sword blade
MAGNU:
(approaching)
Haaaaaaaaa! Hah!
(continues under)
WALLA: Laughter and excited chatter
PARABE:
Who on earth is that?
GUNTHE:
That boy’s going to take someone’s head off.
LAIN:
(furtively, to Magnus)
Brother Magnus, what are you doing?
(aloud)
Your Majesties, I apologize! This is not part of the…
(to Magnus)
Get off the stage!
SOUND: Sword swinging
MAGNU:
Yaaah! Look, Father Laing! The Spiral pose! Torch bearer pose! Harvesting the grain! Tiger claw!
PARABE:
Shouldn’t we call the guards in?
GUNTHE:
The monks should be able to handle it. He’s one of theirs, after all… and not a very good one.
LAIN:
Magnus! Not around the tent poles.
MAGNU:
Hurricane blade! Cannon kick! Hah!
LAIN:
Magnus! Come away from that pole!
SOUND: Crack of wood
MAGNU:
(falling)
Whoa, woah, whoa!
SOUND: Crash and thump
WALLA: Gasps and groans, a few laughs and cheers, then screams of panic
PARABE:
Oh dear!
GUNTHE:
Idiot’s gone and gutted himself.
PARABE:
Oh dear, there’s blood everywhere…
MAGNU:
(weakly)
Ow! Dammit! I mean… cursèd… I mean… doggone drat in a hat…
SOUND: Wooden beams creak and then cave in
WALLA: Gasps
LAIN:
Magnus!
MAGNU:
Augh!
MON:
(running over)
Brothers! Father Laing! Are you all right?
LAIN:
Find the right place to stand, and the violence and troubles of the world shall pass you by.
MAGNU:
(muffled)
I’m fine too!
LAIN:
Your Majesties, Ladies and Gentlemen, there will be, um, a short break in the performance.
(to Magnus)
You idiot.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
HOLL:
I’m telling you, it makes perfect sense! It’s all in the book.
ALB:
It would help if either of us had this book.
HOLL:
What’s next?
ALB:
(wearily)
Purple coneflower?
HOLL:
That’s in the nine hundreds. No, wait… rats, it should be right here between sunflower and ragweed…
ALB:
Never mind. I’ll just get some from the garden.
HOLL:
I know it’s here somewhere…
ALB:
Thank you for your help.
HOLL:
I can sweep the rooms too. Organize your office?
ALB:
(firmly)
No.
HOLL:
But I haven’t made amends properly yet.
ALB:
We’ll call it even.
HOLL:
No, no, that’s not how it works! Upon my honour as a good fairy, I have solemnly…
SOUND: Door opens and monks enter
LAIN:
(entering)
Set him down there.
SOUND: Magnus set down with a bump
MAGNU:
Oof.
LAIN:
Oh, uh, Miss Salix!
ALB:
Yes? What’s happened?
LAIN:
A boy has been injured.
ALB:
Oh, dear. One of yours?
MAGNU:
(weakly)
Hey, Doc.
ALB:
Ah, it’s you.
LAIN:
He ran out during the performance, fell on his sword and brought the stage tent down on himself.
ALB:
Least he could have done is finish the job.
(sighs, then calls)
Holly!
HOLL:
(entering)
What can I do?
ALB:
I need fresh bloodwort. Lots of it.
HOLL:
(running off)
Coming up!
LAIN:
Miss Salix, I would entrust young Magnus to your care.
ALB:
What for? I’ll bandage him up and you can be on your merry way tomorrow.
LAIN:
Well, he is badly hurt, and we are, um, leaving town early.
ALB:
Ah. King didn’t appreciate the impromptu renovations, huh?
LAIN:
He was tough but fair.
HOLL:
(hurrying in)
Here’s the bloodwort.
(gasps)
Oh, geez, the poor kid!
MAGNU:
‘M seventeen…
HOLL:
We gotta clean up that gash and close it up.
MAGNU:
They let women and fairies work as physicians here?
LAIN:
Shut up, boy.
MAGNU:
What kind of a place is this?
HOLL:
Hey!
ALB:
Magnus? Hold still, this might hurt.
SOUND: Swat
MAGNU:
Ow! You’re supposed to be healing me!
ALB:
I know. Women, eh?
HOLL:
Oh juniper that’s a lot of blood.
MAGNU:
Eee, ee, ow… dammit to… golly gee darnit that stings.
HOLL:
Sorry, I gotta staunch the wound.
LAIN:
As well, I was hoping that you might give more thought to taking on young Magnus as an apprentice.
ALB:
Are you serious? Look at the damage he’s done in one night.
LAIN:
(lowering his voice)
I think of it this way… he is young, and hot-tempered, he has great interest in seeking the powers of dark magic. Something that I understand you yourself have experience in.
ALB:
(hushed)
Who told you that?
LAIN:
Magnus needs a guiding hand such as yours to set him on the right course.
ALB:
You want me to teach him dark magic?
LAIN:
No. I mean that you have made the journey into the darkest places of the soul and come back to the light.
ALB:
Not interested. I’ll fix the kid up, sure, but his karma is your problem.
LAIN:
Miss Salix. I hope you’ll reconsider.
HOLL:
Alba, you’re gonna have to bandage this one up, I’m feeling all woozy.
ALB:
Great.
SOUND: Drawer opened, rattle of instruments
MAGNU:
Don’t you have Threadstrong brand sutures?
ALB:
Stitch in Time are far better.
MAGNU:
Not on a wound this deep.
ALB:
These are the D series sutures. They’re double-enchanted to prevent infection and promote healing.
MAGNU:
I’m telling you, Threadstrong is the way to go.
SOUND: Rummaging in drawer
ALB:
You want Threadstrong? Fine. But don’t blame me when you come down with drill worms. And they always leave a scar.
MAGNU:
Excellent. Ow, ow.
ALB:
Hold still.
MAGNU:
Ow! Who did you sleep with to get this job? Or are you bestest friends with the Queen or something?
ALB:
Her sister, actually.
MAGNU:
Oh, that explains it.
(pause, then with growing glee)
Wait a second. You’re the Queen’s sister?
ALB:
Quick on the uptake.
MAGNU:
That means it was you… You tried to marry the King! Isn’t that how it happened? Three sisters tried to save the King’s life, and the youngest actually cured him and married him.
ALB:
There are a lot of different stories out there.
MAGNU:
So does that mean you failed? Or did the King just think she was prettier than you? Heh. OW!
ALB:
You should lay still and not talk when I’m trying to stitch you up.
MAGNU:
What, ’cause I might hit a nerve?
(proudly)
Oh yeah.
(pause)
Hey, is that what he meant about how you’ve been to dark places of the soul?
ALB:
Who said that?
MAGNU:
Father Laing. He said you know dark magic.
ALB:
He was only trying to get me to take you in.
MAGNU:
I bet you do. Show me a trick. Show me. Disintegrate something!
ALB:
No.
MAGNU:
Please?
ALB:
Give it up. Laing, tell your young monk here that I don’t do dark magic.
(nothing)
Father Laing?
MAGNU:
He snuck out.
ALB:
Bloody monks!
MAGNU:
I know, eh?
(pause)
Alba?
ALB:
Yes, Magnus.
MAGNU:
Are you evil?
ALB:
You don’t want to know.
MAGNU:
Yeah I do.
ALB:
No, you really don’t.
MAGNU:
C’mon, you can tell me all about your sins. I’m a holy man. Hey, where are you going? You haven’t done my leg yet. I’m still bleeding.
ALB:
(leaving)
Good. Keep it up.
MAGNU:
Ha ha, funny.
(pause)
Alba?
INT. PANTRY, CONTINUOU:
HOLL:
Hey, Alba. Get you anything?
ALB:
No, I’m fine.
HOLL:
Sorry about ducking out… whew! All that blood. I had to make some tea and calm down a bit.
(guilty)
I kind of used the last of your camomile, but I’ll get you some more…
ALB:
Mm hmm.
HOLL:
Whatcha looking for? I can find it for you.
ALB:
Found it, thanks.
HOLL:
Alba, that’s not wild carrot, by the way, that’s poison hemlock…
ALB:
I know what I’m doing, Holly.
HOLL:
Alba? What are you doing?
ALB:
Just taking care of my patient.
HOLL:
You’re not going to… I mean, I know he’s annoying and all, but he’s just a kid! You can’t just kill him!
ALB:
I’ve got motive, means and opportunity. The monks all up and skipped town. Who’s going to know? Or care?
HOLL:
I can’t let you do this.
ALB:
Get out of my way, fairy.
HOLL:
Alba, I thought you were nice!
ALB:
(grimly)
Ha.
HOLL:
Or at least, I thought you were a good witch, but you’re…
ALB:
Yes?
HOLL:
I don’t know.
(beat)
Alba? Are you evil?
Pause.
ALB:
No. But I like having the option.
HOLL:
(lets out a breath)
Well, thank all the twinkly stars for that.
ALB:
Now get out of my way. I’ve gotta stitch up the idiot kid.
HOLL:
(clears her throat)
Hemlock. Hand it over.
ALB:
(sighs)
HOLL:
Thank you.
INT. PALAC:
GUNTHE:
Will the defendant please stand.
MAGNU:
Yo.
SOUND: Chair pushed back
GUNTHE:
Brother Magnus of Hezelford, this court finds you guilty of endangering the public, destruction of royal property, causing a disturbance and making a complete mess of the new curtains.
MAGNU:
I object, your Kingship.
GUNTHE:
Don’t get smart with me. I, Gunther the Third, King of Farloria, do sentence you to five thousand hours of community service.
MAGNU:
What?!
GUNTHE:
Did I say five thousand? I meant six thousand.
MAGNU:
Dammit.
GUNTHE:
To be served at the House of Healing under the care of Miss Alba Salix, Royal Physician…
ALB:
What?!
MAGNU:
(suddenly seeing the bright side)
Heeey…
GUNTHE:
…in the hopes that she will be a good influence on your character and keep you out of trouble.
ALB:
Gunther, what are you thinking?
SOUND: Gavel bang
WALLA: Whispering
GUNTHE:
Court is dismissed.
(to Alba)
Alba, I’m counting on you.
ALB:
Gunther! Wait!
MAGNU:
Hey there, boss.
ALB:
(sighs)
Hello, Magnus.
MAGNU:
You ready to rock?
ALB:
Fine. Let’s get back to the House of Healing.
MAGNU:
Sweet. You can give me my first lesson in black magic.
ALB:
All right, all right.
(leaving)
Have you ever had hemlock?
MAGNU:

No, is it good?

SOUND: Morning birds
SOUND: Knocking at wooden door
ALB:
Magnus. Time to get up.
MAGNU:
(muffled)
Okay, okay. Hold your horses, jeez.
SOUND: Door opens, clattering of tools
MAGNU:
(emerging)
Hey, it’s dark out, Alba. Why did you wake me up in the middle of the night?
ALB:
It’s practically dawn.
MAGNU:
Practically, but not actually dawn. Therefore, night.
ALB:
Here. Take this bottle. I need you to collect the dewdrops from the grass.
MAGNU:
What for?
ALB:
A lot of spells call for moondrops—dewdrops collected the night of a full moon.
MAGNU:
But that means bending over. I’m still wounded, you know.
ALB:
You’re fine. It’s time for you to start earning your keep.
(leaving)
Now get to it, before the sun comes up and they burn off.
MAGNU:
(calling after her)
This is inhumane treatment, you know.
(sighs)
SOUND: Soft rustling of grass
MAGNU:
(muttering)
Come on. Dammit, this thing’s too small. She could at least give me a jar or a funnel or something.
BIR:
I offer thee a tiny clue.
MAGNU:
What? Who’s there? Whoa… was that you?
BIR:
I offer thee a tiny clue to catch the precious morning dew.
MAGNU:
You’re a bird.
SOUND: Bird twitter
MAGNU:
It must be the sleep deprivation. I need coffee.
BIR:
Sing a song to every drop.
MAGNU:
Excuse me?
BIR:
Into the bottle it will pop.
MAGNU:
You’re not serious.
BIR:
Sing a song to every drop.
MAGNU:
I am not singing a song to a bunch of dewdrops.
(fussing)
I already look like enough of a loser trying to catch dewdrops in a tiny… dammit…
BIR:
Sing a song.
MAGNU:
I’m not singing! Go away! Do I tell you how to do your job?
BIR:
Sing a song to every drop.
MAGNU:
(giving chase)
Scram! Beat it! Go catch a worm or something. Hee-yah!
SOUND: Shovel picked up and thrown
BIR:
(running away)
Into the bottle it will pop!
MAGNU:
Go ahead. One more rhyme and I’ll show you my advanced shovel technique.
SOUND: Annoyed twittering
MAGNU:
Yeah, same to you!
(yawns)
All right. Dewdrops…
SOUND: Holly’s wings, approaching
HOLL:
(flying in, sleepy and spacey)
Good morning!
MAGNU:
Wrong on both counts.
HOLL:
Oh, Magnus. It’s a beautiful morning. And last night!
(sighs happily)
I flew to the stone circle in the Golden Glade with eleven other fairies. We did a dance to the full moon, and tried this amazing wine I made from star-berries…
MAGNU:
Well, aren’t you just special.
HOLL:
Aw. Why are you such a grumpy goose?
MAGNU:
Let’s see… I’m forced into hard labour despite my life-threatening injuries. And at night I have to sleep in the toolshed. But no, wait, I’m not allowed to sleep because it’s four A.M. and time to gather dewdrops in a thimble.
HOLL:
Oh, moondrops. Of course! Are you singing to them?
MAGNU:
Holly… don’t you start, too. Some bird’s already been trying to tell me how to do it.
HOLL:
You should always listen to the birds and animals. They’re your friends!
MAGNU:
My friends have bigger vocabularies.
HOLL:
So. The dewdrops in Alba’s garden usually like the key of B flat major. It all depends on the type of grass. Watch.
(sings)
Come, spring from your leaves, each glimmering bead…
SOUND: Tiny drip
HOLL:
See?
MAGNU:
Holly, I am not singing to Alba’s front lawn.
HOLL:
It’s easy.
MAGNU:
Well, you do it, then.
WALLA: PANICKY VOICES, HUSHED, MIDDLE DISTANC:
SOUND: Urgent door-knocking
HOLL:
(takes a breath and resumes singing)
Each glimmering…
(stops abruptly)
Oh my gosh. They’re bringing someone in.
MAGNU:
Oh. Yeah… looks like an emergency case. We better go see.
HOLL:
You should stay and get the dewdrops before they’re gone.
MAGNU:
Hey… why don’t I go, and you get the dewdrops?
HOLL:
(calling)
Remember, B‑flat!
SOUND: Holly flies off
MAGNU:
Yeah, like I know from B‑flat. Well, thanks a million.
(pause; then sings, badly and trying not to be heard)
Spring from your leaves… every glimmering bead…
(sighs)
I hate my life.
MUSIC: OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Second: The Labours of Magnus.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
ALB:
Holly. There you are.
HOLL:
(arriving)
Hi Alba! Sorry I’m late.
ALB:
I need the Silver Star ointment, the Quick-Knit compresses and a pair of pliers.
HOLL:
You got it.
SOUND: Pantry door
ALB:
(announcing)
Patient is male, mid-forties, with a deep puncture to the right leg and probable concussion.
HOLL:
(returning)
Wait, I know him… that’s Jerome! The guy who was in here the other day for his gout, right?
ALB:
And the day before that for a cold, and the day before that…
HOLL:
And now he’s got an arrow in his leg? Talk about unlucky!
ALB:
You have to wonder.
HOLL:
What happened?
ALB:
Just before sunrise, his son heard a commotion in the henhouse, thought it was a wolf and shot him in the leg with a crossbow. Jerome tried to run, tripped over a blue bantam rooster and cracked his head on a stone.
HOLL:
Wow… he got a goose egg from a chicken?
ALB:
Fell right on his wounded leg too. Luckily he hasn’t lost too much blood, but we’ll have to be careful not to damage the femoral artery…
MAGNU:
(entering)
What’s up. Whoa, did he take a crossbow bolt to the leg? That’s heavy duty. Can I help take it out?
ALB:
I’d rather keep my patient, thanks. Holly, I need seven drops of the ointment, all around where the arrow went in.
HOLL:
Sure thing.
MAGNU:
Isn’t that the Jerome guy you always complain about?
ALB:
The very one.
MAGNU:
Well, hey, now’s your moment!
ALB:
My moment to what?
MAGNU:
You know… off him.
HOLL:
Magnus!
ALB:
I didn’t off you.
MAGNU:
Well, clearly you knew a good thing when you saw it.
ALB:
We all make mistakes.
SOUND: Clinking of eyedropper in bottle
MAGNU:
I can do that. I can clean out the wound if you want.
JEROM:
(howls in pain, though still asleep)
HOLL:
Oh my gosh, I’m sorry, Jerome!
MAGNU:
See, she’s doing it wrong.
ALB:
No, no, I think he’s having a reaction to something the ointment.
MAGNU:
Maybe he objects to being treated by a fairy.
HOLL:
Maybe he objects to the presence of a nasty human.
MAGNU:
Holly, you shouldn’t talk about Alba like that.
ALB:
That’s very odd. Couldn’t be the silver, could it?
HOLL:
I’ll make up a Sanitas tincture. That should disinfect without causing a reaction.
ALB:
No, it won’t be as effective.
MAGNU:
Yeah, Holly.
HOLL:
It is so effective!
ALB:
Hand me the amulet hanging on the door. Second hook.
SOUND: Fine chain jingles
MAGNU:
This one?
ALB:
Thanks.
MAGNU:
(laying it on thick)
You’re welcome, Alba.
ALB:
Munda me. Clarifica me, Clara. (MOON-da MAY. cla-REEF-ica MAY)
SOUND: Whispery magic flourish
HOLL:
(quietly, a mantra)
I’m a good fairy and I help people. I’m a good fairy and I… Ooh, pretty!
ALB:
Right, let’s get that arrow out. Holly, get ready to apply pressure on the wound.
HOLL:
Sure thing.
MAGNU:
I know this technique that we learned back at the monastery where you can melt wood. I bet that would work.
ALB:
I need you to stay out of the way, Magnus.
MAGNU:
I totally studied this! My mind has power over wood!
SOUND: Big jug picked up
ALB:
You want something to do? Here. Go up the road to the royal stables and gather up the saltpeter from under the manure pile.
MAGNU:
What?
ALB:
Saltpeter. It leaches out of the manure as it ages.
MAGNU:
I know where it comes from. But why me? Why can’t Holly do it?
ALB:
I need her help in here.
MAGNU:
I can do surgery!
ALB:
Magnus.
MAGNU:
(getting whiny)
C’mon. Why do you think they call it saltpeter? It causes… wiltage.
HOLL:
Wiltage?
MAGNU:
Wiltage of the…
(uncomfortable)
the peter.
ALB:
You aren’t going to eat any, are you?
HOLL:
And anyway, why does that matter if you’re a monk? I thought you had power over wood.
MAGNU:
It saps the essential masculine energy that I need to perform amazing feats of martial arts.
ALB:
That works out nicely then. Get out there and shovel.
MAGNU:
(leaving)
Hmph. This is why my prior warned me not to consort with women!
SOUND: Door opens, shuts
ALB:
(calling)
You should have listened to him.
(to Holly)
Now then. Bend the leg towards me, please, and hold the bandage there.
JEROM:
(whimpers foggily in his sleep)
HOLL:
Okay. Hang in there, Jerome…
ALB:
Maybe Magnus was right. If I didn’t have this dope coming to me every day for his nonexistent problems, I could have so much time back…
HOLL:
Alba, that’s an awful thing to say.
ALB:
Having second thoughts about doing good deeds for an evil witch?
HOLL:
You aren’t evil, you just need someone to help. And keep an eye on you.
INT. STABLES, MORNIN:
SOUND: Morning birds, distant horse snorts and whinnies
SOUND: Scraping of pitchfork
SOUND: Squirrel chitter
MAGNU:
Damn witches and fairies. Trying to keep a good man down. Gods, it stinks out here!
SQUIRRE:
Dance a turn with yonder broom.
MAGNU:
What? Oh. Great, now it’s squirrels giving me advice.
SQUIRRE:
Dance a turn with yonder broom. Thy labours will be over soon.
MAGNU:
Bite me. I’m not dancing. My manhood’s already suffering enough damage.
SQUIRRE:
Dance a turn with yonder broom.
MAGNU:
Go away! Git! Damn rodent! Hya!
SOUND: Pitchfork whooshing and clanging, angry chittering
SQUIRRE:
Dance a turn with yonder broom!
MAGNU:
Beady-eyed little freak! Take that! Hai! Hoo!
(toppling over)
Whoaaaa!
SOUND: Heavy squelch; pitchfork clatters to the ground
MAGNU:
Augh! Crap.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
JEROM:
Ughh…
ALB:
That should do it, I think.
HOLL:
Alba, I think he’s coming round.
JEROM:
(sleepily)
Oh dear. Oh, ouch, ouch, what’s wrong with my…
HOLL:
Easy there, Jerome… you bumped your head.
JEROM:
What’s going on?
HOLL:
You’re at the House of Healing. Easy now. Try not to move that leg either.
JEROM:
My leg?
ALB:
Do you remember being shot with a crossbow?
JEROM:
No… I just remember… the moon, and… chickens everywhere…
ALB:
Quit moving around, Jerome.
JEROM:
I know you…
ALB:
Yes. Sadly.
JEROM:
Al… Alba? I remember you, you’re nice.
HOLL:
He’s delirious. Jerome? How many fingers am I holding up?
JEROM:
Chickens… tasty chickens…
SOUND: Door opens and shuts; squishy footsteps approach
HOLL:
Jerome?
ALB:
I definitely like him better concussed. Ugh, where’s that smell coming from?
(sternly)
Jerome?
JEROM:
Wuh?
HOLL:
Magnus! What happened?
MAGNU:
(arriving)
Everybody just shut up.
ALB:
Magnus, what…?
(Sighs)
Please stop tracking manure everywhere. Why don’t you wash up outside?
MAGNU:
Your neighbourhood is full of smug, smartass woodland creatures and they all hate me.
JEROM:
(a groan, almost dog-like)
HOLL:
Jerome, you really have to relax. Alba, I’m going to make up a Samstrong’s potion for Jerome.
ALB:
Did Magnus get enough moondrops?
SOUND: A desk bell rings
MAGNU:
Hey, someone’s at the counter!
COUNTES:
(from the other room, cheerful)
Hello! Excuse me!
ALB:
Oh, drat, I forgot. Countess Carnelia has an appointment this morning. If it’s not one thing, it’s eighteen hundred other things…
COUNTES:
I say. Hellooo!
HOLL:
She sounds nice.
SOUND: Rummaging with jars
ALB:
Ridiculous woman. Of course, she is a friend of Parabel’s. Won’t take any medicine I give her, unless it’s leeches… Dammit. Magnus!
MAGNU:
Now what?
ALB:
We’re fresh out of leeches. I need you to gather another jug of them from the pond out back.
MAGNU:
Yup, that’s why I studied surgery at the Monastery, so I could shovel crap and fetch leeches.
ALB:
Magnus.
MAGNU:
Fine, how do I catch them?
ALB:
Easy. You go to the pond, roll up your trousers and wade in.
MAGNU:
Oh, that sounds like fun.
ALB:
Or I could get a pair of scissors and we can study surgery on your liver.
JEROM:
(dreamily)
Liver…
MAGNU:
Okay, okay.
SOUND: Jug hefted, then footsteps
ALB:
(calling after him)
And make sure to pry the leeches off. Never squeeze them.
MAGNU:
Whatever!
SOUND: Door slams
INT. RECEPTION, CONTINUOU:
SOUND: Desk bell
COUNTES:
Hellooo!
ALB:
(entering)
Your Ladyship.
COUNTES:
Miss Salix! Good morning.
ALB:
Sorry to keep you waiting. How have you been?
COUNTES:
Oh, busy, busy, you know how it is, the life of a patron and philanthropist…
ALB:
Of course! That reminds me… the Queen suggested you might be inclined to make a small donation to the House of Healing?
COUNTES:
(uncomfortable)
Yes, well. I’ll have to talk it over with my bookkeeper. I’m… reorganizing my giving portfolio, you see. And I’ve been so dreadfully busy of late…
ALB:
All those salons and parties must have you positively exhausted.
COUNTES:
Oh, you have no idea. It’s been taking a terrible toll, Miss Salix—my health has been in tatters. Just look! My hands are swollen again and my face is red as a beet…
ALB:
Your hands look fine to me.
COUNTES:
Oh, no, no. They may look fine but my hand specialist always told me I’m at great risk of fatsoplasia.
ALB:
You don’t say.
COUNTES:
And my ear, nose and toenail specialist is warning me I have too much blood in my bloodstream. Look how red I am!
ALB:
Your Ladyship, you’re about as red as an albino snowman who’s seen a ghost.
COUNTES:
But that’s only the outward aspect. A healer such as yourself should know the difference between mere appearances and true inner redness.
ALB:
Yes, of course.
COUNTES:
I need more leeches—I think the ones you gave me are too full.
ALB:
My assistant is just fetching you some now. Did you drink the tincture I gave you?
COUNTES:
Eugh. That stinking, undrinkable pink tincture?
ALB:
I really think you should drink that tincture.
COUNTES:
I tried, but I simply couldn’t.
ALB:
You’ll let leeches stick themselves to you, but you won’t take a simple herbal—
COUNTES:
Miss Salix, isn’t there anything you can do?
ALB:
(under her breath)
I could stitch your mouth shut for a start.
INT. OPERATING ROO:
JEROM:
Uhhhh…
HOLL:
Hey there, Jerome. I just need you to drink this.
JEROM:
What’s that?
HOLL:
It’s a Samstrong’s Healing Extreme potion. Made with fresh dewdrops, so it’s got all the healing power of the full moon.
JEROM:
The moon? I like the moooon.
(drinks)
HOLL:
I know, me too!
(leaving)
Just take it easy and I’ll be back in a few minutes.
JEROM:
I like the mooooon…
(it starts to turn into a howl)
EXT. LEECH POND, DA:
SOUND: Songbirds, ducks
SOUND: Water sloshes
MAGNU:
(to himself, near panic)
Oh, jeez dangit heck I should have stayed at the monastery. Okay. Pry it off, don’t squeeze. Pry it off, don’t squeeze. Urrghghhh!
SOUND: Tiny pop and splash
MAGNU:
Urgh… that’s one. Wait, that’s it? One leech? C’mon… please don’t make me wade back in there…
(pause, then calls)
Okay, guys, I’m ready. I’ll dance or sing or whatever as long as I don’t have to go back in the leech pond. Guys? People of the animal kingdom? Figures. They’re never there when you need them…
(muttering, under the following)
Living on nuts and berries. I know they’re laughing at us.
SOUND: Fluttering wings arrive
BIR:
(whispering)
This oughta fix him.
SQUIRRE:
(whispering)
What’s in the vial?
BIR:
(whispering)
Stole it from the witch’s pantry. You’ll see.
(clears throat)
Greetings, human child.
MAGNU:
Oh, hey, Mister Bird. Sorry about earlier.
BIR:
Think nothing of it.
MAGNU:
Um, any tips on collecting leeches? So far I got a total of one.
BIR:
One is all you need. Leeches just need the right food, you see.
MAGNU:
I am not letting them feed on me, thank you very much.
BIR:
No need for blood. I got something a thousand times more powerful.
MAGNU:
Aren’t you supposed to talk in rhyme?
BIR:
Sometimes you gotta improvise. Break loose. De-versify, you might say. Here, take this vial.
MAGNU:
(reading)
“Drake’s Jelly”. What’s drake’s jelly?
SQUIRRE:
(delighted)
Nooo. You didn’t!
BIR:
(aside)
Zip it, squirrel. You trying to blow this?
(to Magnus)
It’s a growth formula—a multiplication factor.
MAGNU:
It makes leeches multiply?
BIR:
(evasive)
Something like that.
SOUND: Tiny clink
MAGNU:
Okay. As long as there’s no dancing. How do you know all this stuff, anyway?
BIR:
You learn a lot when you hang around a witch’s house.
MAGNU:
Hey, he likes it! He’s actually going for it.
BIR:
Welp, gotta fly! Nests to build, songs to sing…
MAGNU:
He’s getting bigger. Cool. Do they divide in half, like amoebas, and camels?
BIR:
Later, human!
MAGNU:
(distracted)
Right! Thanks for the tip.
SOUND: Fizzing
MAGNU:
Wow, he’s really growing fast.
SOUND: Splashing
SOUND: Tiny, rasping screech
MAGNU:
Holy crap. Bird! What is this stuff?! What did you do?
SOUND: Screech, slightly bigger
SOUND: Jug being stoppered
MAGNU:
Oh gods. Goodbye, liver. I’ll miss you.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
COUNTES:
I want a test for fatsoplasia.
ALB:
But that’s not what you have, your Ladyship.
COUNTES:
I know what I have! On account of being the one who has it!
ALB:
You’re showing none of the symptoms.
HOLL:
(entering)
Jerome’s had his potion, Alba.
ALB:
Thanks Holly. Can you go check on Magnus?
HOLL:
Will do.
COUNTES:
My colour specialist was telling me I should be taking moosemint leaf.
ALB:
(skeptical)
I suppose that wouldn’t hurt…
COUNTES:
Would you please provide me with some, in that case?
ALB:
Why are you coming to see me if you have all these specialists?
COUNTES:
(caught)
Well… you are the Royal Physician, appointed by the King himself.
ALB:
So, nothing to do with the fact that treatment at the House of Healing is paid for by the King himself.
COUNTES:
I don’t know what you’re insinuating.
ALB:
I’m sure you don’t.
COUNTES:
Do you have any moosemint?
ALB:
No. None.
COUNTES:
Well, so much for nationalized medicine.
ALB:
Do you actually pay any taxes?
COUNTES:
Where are my leeches?
EXT. GARDE:
MAGNU:
(chummy)
Hey, Holly…
HOLL:
Hi Magnus! How did you do with the leeches?
MAGNU:
Good, good. Say, this is just a hypothetical question…
HOLL:
Yes?
MAGNU:
If you were going to shrink something, like with magic, how would you do it?
HOLL:
Is this about the saltpeter?
MAGNU:
No, it’s about the lee… it’s about learning basic magic concepts, which I’m trying to do, as an apprentice.
HOLL:
Magnus. You know fibbing causes acne.
MAGNU:
Not fibbing!
HOLL:
What did you do? Is it the leeches?
MAGNU:
No.
SOUND: Leech screech, muffled
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Maybe.
HOLL:
What did you do?
MAGNU:
It wasn’t me! It was your friend the bird! Honest!
HOLL:
Let me see that jug.
MAGNU:
No! Don’t open it!
SOUND: Big stopper pulled, and a burbling screech, louder and deeper
HOLL:
Yeow!
MAGNU:
Put the lid back on! Put it on!
SOUND: Burbling; stopper wrestled back in
HOLL:
(breathless)
Magnus! What did you do?
MAGNU:
It was the bird! He told me to feed them drake’s jelly!
SOUND: Muffled screech
HOLL:
What? You know what drake’s jelly is, don’t you?
MAGNU:
It’s this green stuff that comes in a tiny bottle…
HOLL:
It’s where baby dragons come from.
MAGNU:
What?!
HOLL:
Worms and leeches are the larval stage.
MAGNU:
For dragons.
HOLL:
Yes! Earthworms turn into hill dragons, leeches turn into water dragons, nematodes turn into vinegar dragons… But they don’t do that unless they eat drake’s jelly.
MAGNU:
And where does that come from?
HOLL:
From dragons, silly. It comes out of these glands they have under their—
SOUND: Screech
MAGNU:
That’s a real dragon in there?
HOLL:
Yeah. Gosh, he had big jaws.
MAGNU:
All the better to eat us with.
SOUND: Distant door slam, and businesslike footsteps
HOLL:
Uh oh.
ALB:
(approaching)
Magnus, what’s taking so long?
MAGNU:
(freaked)
Hi Alba!
ALB:
Please tell me you’ve managed to catch some leeches.
MAGNU:
I, uh… why, yes, as a matter of fact, they’re right here. Uh, you don’t have to open it though! I was just thinking maybe there weren’t enough of them. I thought I’d go back for some more.
HOLL:
Magnus has something to tell you, don’t you, Magnus?
MAGNU:
Well. I. That is…
ALB:
Yes?
SOUND: Door again, and running footsteps
COUNTES:
(a distant scream, then, approaching)
Help! Mad dog! Horrible, filthy beast! Help!
JEROM:
(close behind, barking happily)
Whoof? Rarf! Woof!
(pants)
ALB:
Toby! What are you doing here?
COUNTES:
Get this thing away! It’s sniffing me!
ALB:
Off. Toby, get off the Countess. Sorry, Your Ladyship. That’s just Toby. He sort of… turns up every once in a while.
JEROM:
Urrf!
COUNTES:
Horrible creature! It’s probably full of diseases…
ALB:
He’s fine. Toby, off. Scram.
JEROM:
(whines)
SOUND: Dog footsteps recede
COUNTES:
You can be sure I won’t be donating any money to this place.
ALB:
Oh well.
COUNTES:
Is that my jug of leeches?
MAGNU:
Well, you see, it’s, uh, not a very nice jug, and I thought—
ALB:
Just give the Countess her damned leeches and she’ll be on her way.
HOLL:
(worried)
Um… Alba, that’s not a good idea…
COUNTES:
Give me that jug!
SOUND: Jug snatched, water sloshes
COUNTESS (CONT’D)
Honestly.
ALB:
(hurrying things along)
There you are. So lovely to see you again, your Ladyship.
COUNTES:
Not so fast. You’d better not be trying to cheat me.
SOUND: Squeaking of stopper
MAGNU:
No!
HOLL:
Don’t open it! Magnus, tell them.
MAGNU:
Honest! There’s lots in that jug. I counted twice.
COUNTES:
(straining with the stopper)
I’m supposed to believe you, you unsanitary little man?
MAGNU:
And it’s a very tricky stopper and you won’t be able to get it back in.
ALB:
Yes! You’ve got your leeches, now have a lovely day and hope you feel better soon.
COUNTES:
What are you all trying to hide?
MAGNU:
Nothing! But the leeches are… very sensitive to light.
COUNTES:
(straining again)
For heaven’s sake.
HOLL:
(unable to contain herself)
Countess, you can’t have that jug! There’s a giant dragon in there!
Silence.
MAGNU:
(weakly)
Heh!
ALB:
Holly, what’s gotten into you?
COUNTES:
I’ve never heard such rubbish in my life.
MAGNU:
Yeah, Holly. What rubbish.
(suddenly urgent)
But no, seriously, Countess! I’d wait until you get home to…
SOUND: Pung! the lid pops. a huge screech, slithering
COUNTES:
(screams)
SOUND: Jug smashes on the ground, water splatters. burbly screech
MAGNU:
…open it.
ALB:
Magnus!
MAGNU:
It’s not my fault!
ALB:
That’s a water dragon.
HOLL:
Ohh! He’s beautiful!
ALB:
What have you done now?
MAGNU:
I deny everything!
SOUND: Screech
ALB:
Get back!
HOLL:
He’s already so much bigger. Who’s a good little dragon?
SOUND: Screech and snap of jaws, slithering, and heavy snorting breathing
(continues under)
COUNTES:
Help! We’re cornered! It’s going to eat us!
ALB:
(calmly)
Mister Dragon.
HOLL:
I’m gonna call him… Langley.
ALB:
I’m guessing you’re too young to understand what I’m saying, but we’re not going to hurt you. We’re just going to edge along this wall toward the back door if that’s all right.
SOUND: Warning screech
COUNTES:
(screams)
MAGNU:
That’s pretty much a no.
ALB:
So much for diplomacy.
MAGNU:
I bet I could take him. Want me to subdue him?
HOLL:
Magnus, you be nice to Langley.
ALB:
He’s agitated enough as it is.
SOUND: Hiss!
COUNTES:
Get it away from me! Kill it!
ALB:
Your Ladyship, please pull yourself together.
COUNTES:
Do something!
HOLL:
You’re both scaring him. There, there, little guy…
SOUND: Snarl
COUNTES:
No! Get it away!
ALB:
For heaven’s sake. Aurei somni oculos implebunt.
(AW-ree SOM-nee OC-you-los im-PLAY-bunt)
SOUND: Magic noise, fizzles
MAGNU:
(after a moment)
What did that do?
SOUND: Dragon hiss
ALB:
I guess that sleeping spell doesn’t work on dragons.
COUNTES:
(sleepy)
Get… away… thing… breathing on me…
(snores)
SOUND: Body falls to the ground
ALB:
Works on countesses, at least.
SOUND: Quieter bellow, snuffling
ALBA (CONT’D)
Now you listen, dragon. That’s the Countess Carnelia. She’s my patient and the Queen’s best friend… so you’d better eat all of her. I don’t want any evidence.
HOLL:
Alba! Come on, Langley. Let’s get you down to the seaside where you can get something proper to eat—
SOUND: Louder bellow and snap of teeth
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Eeek! Langley, be nice!
MAGNU:
If only I had some kind of weapon.
ALB:
Magnus, leave it. And Holly, quit trying to pet him. Listen, you’re the only one who can fly. I need you to—
SOUND: Dog running
JEROM:
(angry)
Woof! Woof woof rarf ruff woof!
ALB:
Toby! Be careful!
MAGNU:
That is one weird looking dog.
SOUND: Dragon screech
ALB:
Holly, now! While he’s distracted—get inside. Get me the glass wand and the duckweed pollen.
HOLL:
Duckweed pollen? Ohh… of course! That’s a great idea.
ALB:
Go! Now!
HOLL:
Okay!
SOUND: Holly’s wings, zooming off
SOUND: Screech
JEROM:
Woof! Whuff! Rarf!
MAGNU:
Yup, lead him on, just a little further… that’s it… don’t mind me…
ALB:
Magnus, what are you doing?
SOUND: Shovel clank
MAGNU:
Ha ha! Hyah! Get back, foul fiend! I have the power of Shovel!
ALB:
That’s not helping.
SOUND: Screech, cut short by the plang! of a shovel connecting, then a confused, groggy bellow and MORE THRASHIN:
ALBA (CONT’D)
Magnus!
MAGNU:
Yeah! Snicker-snack, baby! Ya like that?
(jerked off his feet)
Hwaaaugh!
SOUND: Dragon bellow, and the shovel falls to the ground. then, scrambling and scraping
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
(dragged off into the distance)
Craaap! Help! Alba!
JEROM:
Whurrf?
ALB:
Good boy, Toby. You saved us all from being eaten.
JEROM:
(proudly)
Ruff!
(pants)
MAGNU:
Help! Nice dragon…
(being squeezed)
Oooof!
ALB:
Well, close enough.
SOUND: Holly’s wings, approaching
HOLL:
Wow. They grow up so fast, don’t they? He’s been a dragon for fifteen minutes and he can already climb a wall while carrying a gangly human boy.
ALB:
I just had that roof replaced, too.
MAGNU:
Alba! He’s drooling on me! Help?
JEROM:
Rurf?
HOLL:
I didn’t know you had a dog, Alba.
ALB:
Oh, no, Toby’s not mine… he just shows up every few weeks.
HOLL:
Aw, he likes you! Look, he wants tummy rubs.
ALB:
(softening)
He’s all right.
(fondly)
Oh, Toby.
HOLL:
He’s got such a funny build, though. Like a walrus terrier or a… Alba, he couldn’t be a werewolf, could he?
ALB:
He’s not a werewolf. It’s broad daylight, in case you hadn’t noticed. Although, come to think of it, I’ve never seen him during the day before…
MAGNU:
Guys? Little help with this dragon? He’s trying to eat my hea—
(suddenly muffled)
Mmphh!
HOLL:
I guess we should see to Langley, huh?
ALB:
I suppose we should.
HOLL:
I take it the duckweed pollen is for a shrinking spell?
ALB:
Exactly. I need you to fly up there and sprinkle the pollen on the dragon’s back. Then tap him three times with this glass wand and say “Non est parvum vos sentio”.
HOLL:
“Non est parvum vos sentio.”
(taking off)
Got it!
SOUND: Wings, continued throughout
HOLLY (CONT’D)
Hi Langley. It’s just me! Hold still now…
MAGNU:
Mmmph!
SOUND: Glittery magic, then three little tink! noises
HOLL:
Non est parvum vos sentio!
SOUND: Rubbery, stretchy noises, a squelchy pop
MAGNU:
(gasping for breath)
Aghh! N‑nice dragon… friends now?
SOUND: Langley bellows, but the sound shrinks to a tiny squeak
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Whoa, whoa! Holly, what did you do?!
(sliding)
Agh! I can’t get a grip on the roof!
HOLL:
I gotcha, I gotcha!
MAGNU:
Aaaaaa!
SOUND: Slipping and sliding, then a crash of branches and roof tiles
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Oww! I thought you said “I gotcha!”
HOLL:
(fawning)
Poor little Langley. Was it scary up there?
SOUND: Tiny langley bellow
SOUND: Holly lands
ALB:
Thank goodness that worked.
MAGNU:
I’m falling to my death and who does she rescue?
HOLL:
He’s hungry and scared, and besides, you had the shrubbery to break your fall.
MAGNU:
I hate you all. Have I mentioned?
COUNTES:
(waking up)
What… what happened?
ALB:
Your Ladyship! Are you all right?
COUNTES:
You. What am I doing at the House of Healing?
ALB:
(with exaggerated sympathy)
You passed out.
COUNTES:
There was a horrible thing… it tried to eat me…
ALB:
It sounds terrible. You must have been having a nightmare.
COUNTES:
Yes, that’s it… just a nightmare…
JEROM:
(happy)
Rowr ruff woof!
COUNTES:
(screams)
Get it away! Help! Help! Guards! Someone!
(recedes into the distance)
SOUND: Footsteps
ALB:
(calling)
Good boy, Toby! Remind me to give him a biscuit.
MAGNU:
That figures.
ALB:
Fine. I’ll give you a biscuit too.
SOUND: Tiny bellow
HOLL:
I should get this little guy down to the seaside before he gets big again.
ALB:
Yes, do you mind? Take him up north of the Cape, if you have time.
SOUND: Wings
HOLL:
(zooming off)
C’mon, Langley! Let’s hit the beach!
MAGNU:
So! That turned out okay.
ALB:
Magnus.
MAGNU:
Yes Ma’am.
ALB:
How exactly did that leech manage to come into contact with drake’s jelly?
MAGNU:
It was the bird’s fault! I guess she didn’t like me for some reason, and she gave me this bottle of…
ALB:
This is my bottle. From my pantry.
MAGNU:
Yeah! She must have got in through the window. Which Holly still hasn’t fixed.
ALB:
A bird stole it. Is that the best you can come up with?
MAGNU:
Honest! I’d never heard of the stuff. The bird said it would make them multiply…
ALB:
(relenting just a little)
You lived at the Dragon Mountain monastery and you never knew where dragons come from?
MAGNU:
I guess no one sat me down and had that little talk. It’s not like it comes up a lot in day to day medicine, is it?
ALB:
I suppose not.
(calling)
Toby! Hm. Where’d he go?
(sighs)
Oh well. He never stays for long. It’s as if there’s a voice, calling him on, down the road…
JEROM:
(groggy)
Ohhh. Where am I?
ALB:
Jerome, what are you doing out here? You need to rest. And for heaven’s sake, put some clothes on.
JEROM:
Okay.
SOUND: Footsteps recede
ALB:
(leaving)
Look, you’re ruining the dressings we put on you.
JEROM:
(following)
Sorry, Alba.
ALB:
(over her shoulder)
Magnus, clean up all those roof tiles.
MAGNU:
(sighs)
Fine…
SOUND: Door opens and shuts
SOUND: Shoveling debris
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
I think I broke another bone.
RABBI:
Ahem.
MAGNU:
What? Who’s there?
RABBI:
Let the tiles lay where they fell—except for one, and smash it well!
MAGNU:
Oh, no you don’t! I’m not taking any bogus household hints from a rabbit! Beat it! Heeyah! Hoowah!
SOUND: Shovel whirling and clanking; something smashes
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
(cringing)
Ohgods!
ALB:
(from inside)
Magnus!
MAGNU:
Sorry!

Liverwort, spleenwort, brainwort… uh…
HOLL:
(whispering)
Kidneywort.
MAGNU:
(whispering)
I was getting to that.
HOLL:
Just trying to help…
MAGNU:
(aloud)
Kidneywort and Left Pinky Finger-wort.
ALB:
Good. Name three natural anaesthetics.
MAGNU:
Nodding rose, napping violet and blunt trauma.
ALB:
Why do I bother?
MAGNU:
Fine, snoozeweed.
ALB:
Thank you. I suppose this apprenticeship might not be a complete waste.
MAGNU:
You know what would really be worthwhile, though, is if you taught me some magic.
SOUND: Distant clank and crash from outside
HOLL:
(alarmed)
Um, Alba… speaking of herbs… what’s happened to the garden?
ALB:
What? Oh! Who the hell is that? Gods, they’re tearing everything out!
(running out)
Hey! Get out of my garden!
EXT. GARDEN, CONTINUOU:
SOUND: Morning birds
SOUND: Shovels clanking, cracking of branches
SOUND: Door opens. shovels stop
ALB:
(running up)
Hey! Stop that this minute!
JA:
(furtive)
Oh gods, it’s her!
ALB:
Just what do you think you’re doing?
DOUGLA:
Um. Nothing.
JA:
Nothing, Ma’am.
BAILIF:
(approaching)
Excuse me, madam. Is there a problem?
ALB:
Bailiff Henry. What are your men doing destroying my herb garden?
BAILIF:
Merely enforcing the law, madam.
ALB:
I beg your pardon?
SOUND: Rustling paper
BAILIF:
(clears his throat)
“A Royal Decree on the Aesthetic Character of the Royal Lands, County Grandville…”
SOUND: Paper snatched
ALB:
Give me that.
(skimming it)
“All buildings within sight of the Palace to be painted in selected shades of pink…”
BAILIF:
It’s Sub-Section Eight.
ALB:
“Garden at the House of Healing to be torn out and replanted according to Palace standards!”
BAILIF:
There you are.
ALB:
I don’t believe this.
BAILIF:
All right, you men. Stop gawping and get back to it.
DOUGLA:
(scared)
Sir?
BAILIF:
What? What’s gotten into you two? You think she’s going to curse you or something?
JA:
(hushed)
I heard she was the one made Mickey Hutter’s ears fall off.
DOUGLA:
She made the birds peck old Mrs Angley to death.
BAILIF:
She never did that.
ALB:
Oh, didn’t I?
JA:
She’s the Queen’s sister! She’ll have us killed!
BAILIF:
(a little desperate)
Finish the job or it’s two days’ pay docked for both of you!
JA:
With respect, Sir, we wish to resign.
DOUGLA:
I cannot work today on account of I have a terrible cold.
BAILIF:
We have orders—
ALB:
Bailiff, I would be quite happy if your men were to cease work right now. And if they were, perhaps, to help salvage what they’ve torn up, I would be even happier. Otherwise, well… I won’t be responsible for their safety.
JA:
(beat)
Sir?
BAILIF:
I think perhaps we could come to some arrangement.
MUSIC: OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Third: Into the Woeful Woods.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
SOUND: Simmering, and rustling leaves
HOLL:
You’re doing it wrong…
MAGNU:
I am not doing it wrong.
HOLL:
You’re supposed to put the nettles into the water after it starts boiling.
MAGNU:
No one asked you, fairy.
SOUND: Interior door and footsteps
HOLL:
You’re gonna waste an entire bag of leaves.
MAGNU:
Holly, I don’t need tea-making lessons from a hopped-up pixie.
HOLL:
(silent, then suddenly dangerous)
What did you call me.
MAGNU:
A clumsy, mushroom-addled pixie.
SOUND: Angry buzz of wings
HOLL:
Magnus. Don’t you ever call me a pixie.
MAGNU:
I just did. Twice.
(blurts)
Pixie. Oops! Three times.
HOLL:
Don’t associate my name with those people. My Mama and my Grandma fought their kind for years.
MAGNU:
I thought you fairies believed in peace and hugs and whiskers on gryphons.
HOLL:
Not when it comes to pixies! They eat cornflower husks! They bite their toenails!
MAGNU:
You “fought” them? What was it, a cider drinking contest?
SOUND: Holly zooms in and whacks magnus
MAGNU:
Ow! Dammit!
HOLL:
Take it back!
MAGNU:
Get away from me!
SOUND: Chaos: holly flying in circles while magnus swings at her with a broom. smashing and clattering
HOLL:
Take it back! Take it back!
MAGNU:
Pixie! Mushroom fiend!
ALB:
(entering)
What in Hades is going on?!
HOLL:
Take back what you said!
MAGNU:
I bet you kiss bumblebees!
HOLL:
Yeah, well you’re a mean, lazy, good for-nothing young human… youngster!
SOUND: An enormous crash.
HOLL:
Ow!
ALB:
Holly! Magnus!
SOUND: Deathly quiet except for an occasional tinkle of glass bits
ALB:
Well?
MAGNU:
She started it.
HOLL:
(winded)
I did not! He insulted my people!
MAGNU:
Just telling it like it is.
ALB:
Children!
HOLL:
Sorry.
MAGNU:
(simultaneously)
I’m not a…! Sorry.
ALB:
First the bailiff and his lackeys take out my garden, and now you two have wrecked half the pantry.
(sighs)
That was my last bottle of gossamer fern extract. And the doleful goatweed.
HOLL:
I’m sorry, Alba. We’ll replace them all.
ALB:
Yes, you will.
HOLL:
If I have to travel to the ends of the earth.
ALB:
There’s an idea. And take Magnus with you.
HOLL:
I shall atone for my… wait. Magnus? I’m not taking him!
SOUND: Scribbling
ALB:
Yes, you are. You are both going to go out and collect the ingredients on this list.
MAGNU:
Can’t we just go to an apothecary?
ALB:
On my budget?
MAGNU:
I see. The kingdom’s health care system is founded on slave labour.
ALB:
You noticed.
HOLL:
(reading)
Gossamer fern, chuckle briar… golden bellweed?
(worried)
Alba, that only grows in the green grove in the deepest depths of the Woeful Woods.
ALB:
Well, that should narrow down your search.
HOLL:
But those woods are all full of badgers and bears!
MAGNU:
I thought the animals were our friends? What—you scared of a widdle fuzzy badger?
HOLL:
We have… religious differences.
MAGNU:
Did they side with the pixies?
HOLL:
Alba, I can’t go to the Woeful Woods!
ALB:
Magnus will go with you and defend you.
HOLL:
Defend me? Forget badgers—he’s never even seen a tree.
MAGNU:
Can I bring a sword and everything?
EXT. WOOD:
SOUND: Birdsong ambience
SOUND: Footsteps
MAGNU:
Let me see the list.
HOLL:
Why do you care? You couldn’t tell a mushroom from a mulberry bush.
MAGNU:
I want to know what plants we’re looking for.
HOLL:
You just stick to navigating, monkey boy.
MAGNU:
Say, why don’t you go fly up over the trees and see if we’re still heading in the right direc—oh, wait, you hurt your wing flying into the pantry door.
HOLL:
Okay, okay, let’s be nice. C’mon, we have to work together.
MAGNU:
So I hear.
HOLL:
(calming herself)
I’m a good fairy and I help people. I’m a good fairy and I help people.
(to Magnus)
What does your map say?
SOUND: Rustling paper
MAGNU:
Uh… we’re getting close to the turning.
MA:
(thin, accented voice)
In. Fifty Paces. Turn: Left. At: Babbling Brook.
HOLL:
Really? I don’t think I trust this GBH thing. Anything made by gnomes…
MAGNU:
It’s GPS.
HOLL:
Whatever.
MAGNU:
It stands for Gnomish Place Seeker.
HOLL:
It’s probably going to lead us into badger territory. Or bears… Hey look! Fairy cake!
MAGNU:
That’s a cake?
SOUND: Crinkling paper
HOLL:
Uh huh! See? It’s a magic cake we fairies make to sustain us on long journeys.
MAGNU:
What’s it doing lying in the grass?
HOLL:
Some nice fairies must have left it here. I wonder if it was anyone I know…
MAGNU:
Or some nice fairies got eaten by a giant spider and all that’s left is their cake.
HOLL:
Want some?
MAGNU:
I’ll pass, thanks.
HOLL:
(eating)
Mmm. You’re missing out.
MAGNU:
How is it magic?
HOLL:
One little piece like this is enough to keep you going all day. Well… that’s how it’s supposed to work. Mine never turns out. I mean, it tastes good but actually it kinda makes you a little bit hungrier…
MA:
In. One Hundred Paces. Turn: Left. At: Babbling Brook.
HOLL:
Okay, maybe a lot hungrier. But it’s sooo good.
MAGNU:
Can you see the brook yet?
MA:
Reckoning…
HOLL:
No. Shouldn’t we have heard it babbling by now?
MA:
Reckoning…
HOLL:
(slowly becoming more spacey)
Hee. “Babble.” What a great word. Babble, babble…
MAGNU:
Are we heading north?
HOLL:
Duh! Look at the moss on the trees.
MAGNU:
Uh… I’m looking. What about it?
HOLL:
The moss grows on the north side. Dummy.
MAGNU:
Is that true or are you just making up more weird fairy stuff? That’s really north?
HOLL:
Absolutely one hundred percent due north.
MAGNU:
Aw, c’mon, I just got this thing! It can’t be broken already.
HOLL:
Oh my gosh! More fairy cake!
(stops and scarfs it down)
Geez, this is my lucky day.
MAGNU:
Holly. How can you just eat random things you find on the ground?
HOLL:
Trust in the forest and it will provide.
MAGNU:
What if it’s poisoned? Or maybe it’s a trap. Left by pixies. Maybe pixies stole the recipe.
HOLL:
Pixies can’t cook.
MA:
In. Thirty. Paces. Turn: Right. At: Great. Granite Mountain.
MAGNU:
Okay, looking for a mountain.
HOLL:
Oh, sure. You don’t believe me about the moss, but you’ll listen to that piece of paper.
MAGNU:
It can’t be wrong. It’s got all the latest data.
HOLL:
Do you see any mountains?
MAGNU:
They could be hidden by the trees.
MA:
Warning. Warning. This map. Has been. Stolen.
HOLL:
You stole the map?
MAGNU:
What? Holly, I’m hurt that you would think such a thing.
MA:
This map. Has been. Stolen.
MAGNU:
Besides, they wanted a hundred and seventy crowns for i! For a piece of junk!
HOLL:
I bet you didn’t pay for that dagger, either.
MAGNU:
Don’t you talk that way about Bloodletter!
HOLL:
Ew.
MA:
This map. Has been. Stolen. And will now. Self-destruct.
SOUND: A bang and a fizzle, like a firecracker
MAGNU:
Ow! Well, that’s just great.
HOLL:
Ha. It serves you righ… Holy calendula! (ca-LEND-you-la) More fairy cake!
MAGNU:
No map, no compass and you can’t even fly.
HOLL:
(stuffing her face)
First of all, we don’t need a compass. Hello! Moss! And second of all…
(trails off)
Gosh, this is awesome cake…
MAGNU:
I bet you’re faking. I bet you can fly just fine.
HOLL:
If I could fly, believe me, I wouldn’t be here talking to you.
MAGNU:
Well, that’s a darn shame for both of us, then.
(beat)
Any other brilliant ideas? Can your special fairy senses detect jimson weed or whatever?
HOLL:
Watch it, buster. And second of all…
(smug)
I do know the way back.
MAGNU:
Oh? How?
HOLL:
I’ve been leaving a trail of markers behind us. That way, we can just retrace our steps.
MAGNU:
Really? That’s… kind of smart, actually. What are you leaving for markers?
HOLL:
That is the amazingly brilliant part. I’ve been leaving pieces of fairy cake. That way, one, I can travel lighter as we go, and two, we have something to eat on the way back!
A long pause.
HOLL:
(worried now)
Oh.
MAGNU:
Great.
HOLL:
Oh. Oh gosh. The cake we found…
MAGNU:
Uh huh.
HOLL:
All this time we must have been…
(trails off)
MAGNU:
Keep going, that was almost a thought there.
HOLL:
(tiny)
Magnus, I think I ate all the cake.
MAGNU:
Good, and?
HOLL:
(getting whinier)
And now I’m hungrier than I was before.
MAGNU:
Shocking.
HOLL:
This is all your fault. This is all your fault! Distracting me with your useless map.
MAGNU:
Oh, it’s my fault you ate all our trail markers.
HOLL:
Yeah? Well, I hope you get lost.
MAGNU:
We’re already lost!
HOLL:
I hope you fall in a hole. And die. And then get eaten alive by bears.
MAGNU:
Why don’t you have some more cake, pixie?
SOUND: Holly flies off, or tries—the buzzing of her wings is erratic and peters out
HOLL:
Have fun getting out of here without a map!
(in the distance)
Ow! Ow!
SOUND: A crash of bushes
INT. PALAC:
SOUND: Construction and bustling activity
GUNTHE:
There you are, Doctor Krankel.
KRANKE:
Good day, Your Majesty. I’m looking for the Master of Revels.
GUNTHE:
You’re out of luck.
KRANKE:
Majesty?
GUNTHE:
Parabel had him fired, so everyone’s coming to me for approvals.
KRANKE:
I had thought this was to be a surprise birthday party for Her Majesty?
GUNTHE:
It is a surprise party. But she had… strong opinions about the plans.
KRANKE:
Ahh. Well then, Your Majesty will be glad to know the fireworks are all prepared.
GUNTHE:
Excellent. The orchestra will be out on the jetty…
KRANKE:
Perfectly suitable. But with respect, Majesty, I had hoped for a more refined musical accompaniment.
GUNTHE:
I know. But “Balgomarian Rhapsody” is one of Parabel’s favourites.
KRANKE:
Of course, Majesty.
GUNTHE:
Have you found a way to make the banquet appear out of thin air?
KRANKE:
There are several possible approaches, but most efficacious would be to…
ALB:
(approaching)
Gunther.
GUNTHE:
Alba, if you don’t mind, the Sorceror General and I are discussing some important business.
KRANKE:
(charming)
Miss Salix. Good day.
ALB:
More important than the health of your citizens?
GUNTHE:
Why, what’s the problem?
ALB:
The Bailiff’s men destroyed my garden this morning.
GUNTHE:
Your garden?
ALB:
They uprooted my nervous nettles and chopped down the only surviving squid-apple tree this side of the River Twist.
KRANKE:
Oh dear.
GUNTHE:
So, surely the order came from the Bailiff’s office.
SOUND: Paper rustles
ALB:
This is Your Majesty’s signature right here on the work order.
GUNTHE:
Oh, er… Look, I don’t have time to read every word in every document I sign. Certainly not today.
ALB:
How reassuring.
GUNTHE:
Alba, can this please wait until after the party?
KRANKE:
Yes, surely you can use herbs from your existing stores?
ALB:
I have no existing stores!
KRANKE:
How reassuring.
ALB:
They were destroyed by that idiot boy. The one Your Majesty ordered to do his community service for me.
GUNTHE:
This is all very unfortunate, but what do you want me to do about it?
KRANKE:
Your Majesty, perhaps the Office of the Sorceror General can be of assistance here?
ALB:
You?
KRANKE:
Miss Salix, I know we haven’t always seen eye to eye…
ALB:
Ha.
KRANKE:
…but as a gesture of goodwill, I’d like to offer you access to our stockpiles.
ALB:
(coldly)
How very kind of you.
KRANKE:
You’re most welcome, Miss Salix. We at the OSG like to be prepared for emergency situations, droughts, shortages…
ALB:
Acts of vandalism…
KRANKE:
…and the like. Just get in touch with my secretary, and she’ll ensure you have everything you need.
GUNTHE:
There you go! Problem solved.
ALB:
Yes, very convenient. Perhaps a little too convenient.
KRANKE:
I’m sorry?
ALB:
You had my garden torn out, didn’t you, “Doctor” Krankel? Slipped a little old work order in front of the King, in the midst of all the other party paperwork?
KRANKE:
What possible reason could I have—
ALB:
And how do I know these herbs of yours are safe?
KRANKE:
I really must protest—
GUNTHE:
Doctor Krankel has been Sorceror General for twelve years now, and a trusted advisor to both my father and myself—
ALB:
What about those magical listening devices in the council chambers?
KRANKE:
Planted by Meyurian government agents.
ALB:
The suggestibility potion in the Palace drinking water?
KRANKE:
A chance combination of two harmless cooking ingredients.
ALB:
The “accident” aboard HMS Buttercup?
KRANKE:
Was an accident, as you say. Your Majesty, if I may, I must see to the arrival of the pigeon aerobatic team.
GUNTHE:
Thank you, Doctor Krankel.
(sighs)
Alba, why can’t you two get along?
ALB:
I’ve told you, he’s been plotting against you for years. And as the only person who seems able to see that, I’m the biggest obstacle to his plans. Which is why he’s trying to show me up by having my garden destroyed.
GUNTHE:
No, no, that wasn’t Krankel… I remember now. It was Parabel.
ALB:
What?!
GUNTHE:
It was on her giant list of pre-birthday improvements.
ALB:
Parabel wrote this decree?
PARABE:
(approaching)
Did someone call my name?
ALB:
You!
PARABE:
Alba! Which dress should I wear to the party?
ALB:
You had my garden torn out?
GUNTHE:
I’ll just be over here.
PARABE:
I know the blue one is more proper, but I still like the red one.
ALB:
Whichever one you like is probably fine, Your Majesty.
PARABE:
Oh, come on, just pick one of them.
ALB:
Fine. The blue one. It’s… more regal, not as showy.
PARABE:
See? That wasn’t so hard. The red one, please, Millie.
ALB:
Parabel? My garden?
PARABE:
Your what? Oh, you mean that underbrush in front of your building?
ALB:
It’s the herb garden for the House of Healing. Was the herb garden.
PARABE:
Oh. Well… it’s not like it was a very nice one.
ALB:
It’s not supposed to be “nice”. It’s supposed to provide vital medicinal ingredients.
PARABE:
You could grow them in little rows, at least. Or arrange them by colour?
ALB:
I give up.
PARABE:
(calling)
Oooh! I know! You should trim all your plants into cute animal shapes!
ALB:
(leaving)
Happy birthday, Your Majesty.
KRANKE:
(to himself)
That went well.
EXT. WOOD:
MAGNU:
Hey, there we go, Holly! There’s a sign up ahead.
(no reply)
Holly? Pff, whatever. “Welcome to Badgerton, population 38 badgers, 3 bears.”
BADGE:
Why, hello there.
MAGNU:
Whoa!
SOUND: Dagger drawn, clumsily
BADGE:
Now, now. I mean you no harm, good sir.
MAGNU:
You shouldn’t sneak up on a guy.
BADGE:
You look like a young man on a quest.
MAGNU:
Who wants to know?
BADGE:
I am but a simple apothecary.
MAGNU:
You don’t say. And what are you apothecarrying?
BADGE:
Why, magical herbs, tree products, mosses, lichens, fungi, maple syrup and souvenir gifts. Badger’s the name, badger’s the species. Proprietor, comma, Badgerton All-Natural Dispensary.
MAGNU:
Really! Now that’s handy.
BADGE:
Step right this way.
SOUND: Footsteps—following magnus’s pov
SOUND: Shop door with bell, interior ambiance
MAGNU:
Nice hut.
BADGE:
Thank you kindly. I take it by your garb that you are a monk of the Dragon Mountain order.
MAGNU:
Darn straight. Brother Magnus to you.
BADGE:
Warriors and healers by trade, unless I’m much mistaken. Seeking rare medicines, perhaps?
MAGNU:
You got it, Badgerino.
BADGE:
Excellent. What can I get you?
SOUND: Slip of paper
MAGNU:
Let’s see now… buttery goldenrod?
BADGE:
We carry three varieties, all available fresh, dried, powdered, or extract.
MAGNU:
Sweet. How about bladderwort?
BADGE:
Dried only, but it’s top quality.
MAGNU:
This is gonna be easier than I thought.
EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE WOOD:
SOUND: Forest ambiance, slightly creepier
SOUND: Trip and fall, crash of bushes
HOLL:
Oof! Grr! I hate walking! I hate it! And it’s getting darker… Oh gods please don’t let me meet any badgers…
SOUND: Chitinous clicking
SPIDE:
Why hello, little fairy.
HOLL:
Gaah! Where did you come from?
SPIDE:
Oh, I live here. You look tired—won’t you step into my parlour? For… dinner?
HOLL:
No offense, Mister Spider, but your parlour looks kind of… web-like.
SPIDE:
No, no, dear, that’s just decoration. It’s the latest fashion in parlours. Come in, come in!
HOLL:
Mama taught me not to talk to strange eight-foot-tall spiders!
SPIDE:
Please! It’s almost time… for dinner.
SOUND: Snatching and clacking of jaws; snapping of twigs
HOLL:
Yeek! Get away!
SOUND: Erratic flying
HOLL:
(receding into the distance)
Ow ow ow!
SPIDE:
(forlorn)
No one ever wants to stay… for dinner.
INT. HOUSE CONTINUOU:
SOUND: Crackling fire, soft bubbling
SOUND: From outside, an unsteady buzzing of wings
HOLL:
(approaching at speed)
…aaaaaAAAAA!
SOUND: Glass smash and tinkle, thud and more crashing: cutlery, furniture
HOLL:
Oof! Oof! Ow! Oh, my head… oh, Goddess, I am never gonna eat cake ever again.
(pulls herself up with a groan)
Anybody home? Hello? I’m sorry about your window… Holy Molae, something smells so good.
SOUND: Louder bubbling, pot lid clank
HOLL:
Oh my gosh, porridge. YES. Oh porridge, I love you so much.
(takes a mouthful)
Ow! Ow! Hot!
INT. HU:
MAGNU:
And three pounds of soldierwood bark.
BADGE:
Strips or powder?
MAGNU:
It’s all good.
BADGE:
I’d recommend the strips, then. You’ll have to grind it yourself, but it’ll keep far longer. Aaand your total comes to… let’s see, three hundred and seventy-nine crowns, five ducats and sixpence.
MAGNU:
Well. You see, I don’t have that kind of cash, I’m afraid…
BADGE:
We also take MagisterCard and Farlorian Express.
SOUND: Dagger drawn
MAGNU:
Sorry, Mr. Badger. This is, how you say, a stick-up.
BADGE:
Er, I, er, you could always start a tab!
MAGNU:
No no. This is how a stick-up works, you see. You hand over the sack of herbs, and all the cash in the till, or else I stick this dagger up your pointy nose. C’mon. I haven’t got all day.
BADGE:
Here.
SOUND: Bag rustles
MAGNU:
And the cash, please. Chop chop.
SOUND: Coins scooped into another bag
BADGE:
You bring shame to your order.
MAGNU:
Thank you, good sir. I’ll be sure to tell my friends about your fine establishment. You wouldn’t happen to have a map of the area, would you?
INT. HOUS:
SOUND: Crackling fire, no bubbling
SOUND: Wooden door opens, big footsteps
MAM:
(entering)
So, did you have fun?
BAB:
That was the best puppet show ever, Mama! I wanna go again tomorrow!
PAP:
Well, tomorrow it’s a different show for grown-up bears.
BAB:
Does it have duels and guys stabbing people and things?
PAP:
No.
MAM:
(simultaneously)
Yes. You’re too young to see it.
BAB:
Aww!
PAP:
Wait—something’s wrong.
Hush.
HOLL:
(distant snoring)
BAB:
Someone’s broken my chair!
MAM:
Someone’s broken my table!
PAP:
Someone’s broken my front window!
SOUND: Spoon clinks against empty bowl
BAB:
Someone’s eaten my porridge.
PAP:
Someone’s eaten MY porridge!
SOUND: Clank of ladle in pot
MAM:
Someone’s eaten the whole pot.
HOLL:
(distantly: snores, giggles in her sleep)
PAP:
What’s that?
BAB:
There’s somebody in my room!
MAM:
Junior, fetch me that frying pan. Papa, get your pitchfork.
BAB:
Here, Ma.
SOUND: Frying pan clanks
MAM:
We’ve got ourselves an intruder.
EXT. WOODS, NIGH:
SOUND: Big bag rustling, coins jingling
MAGNU:
(to himself; labouring slightly)
Who’s number one? That’s right, Magnus number one, muthagooses.
GUAR:
(calling, distant)
Brother Magnus! You are charged with theft. Stand, in the name of the law!
MAGNU:
I scorn your local badger laws! I scoff! Ha ha!
SOUND: Distant bowstring; arrow swoosh and thunk, close by
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Whoa, Nelly. I, uh… vanish into the night!
SOUND: Running footsteps
GUAR:
(running)
Stand, robber! Show your hands!
SOUND: Another arrow, further away
SOUND: Running
MAGNU:
(out of breath)
Ha! Lost ’em.
HOLL:
(whispering)
Magnus? Magnus, over here!
MAGNU:
Holly?
HOLL:
Shhh! They’ll hear us!
MAGNU:
Holly, why are you locked in a wooden cage marked “Thife”?
HOLL:
Because bears don’t know how to spell the word “Thief”.
MAGNU:
Huh. Well, at least they spelled the word “Lunch” right.
HOLL:
What?! Is that what that one says?
MAGNU:
Bears, huh? Well, I hope they kill you humanely before they eat you.
HOLL:
What? Magnus, get me out of here!
MAGNU:
You dare ask me to pervert the legal system?
HOLL:
Come on! You know how to melt wood!
MAGNU:
No time, I’m afraid. I’ve gotta deliver my cargo of magic woo woo herbs to the boss.
HOLL:
You found the herbs?
SOUND: Sack rustling
MAGNU:
Every last one on the list. Look! Musk roses, eglantine, and a pound of smug bastardroot.
HOLL:
You cheated. You went to a store.
MAGNU:
I never.
HOLL:
You totally did. I bet you stole it all too!
MAGNU:
Mister Badger let me have it for free! I guess he just liked my face.
SOUND: Arrow swish and thunk
GUAR:
(distant)
Brother Magnus! Stand and show yourself!
BADGE:
(distant)
That’s the boy! Get him!
SOUND: Running feet approach
MAGNU:
Yikes. I guess that’s my cue.
(heaves his bag back up and starts running off)
So long, bear bait! Ooof!
SOUND: Trip and fall—bag crashes, coins scatter
SOUND: Running footsteps, sword drawn
GUAR:
Stay down! Hands on your head! Now!
SOUND: Snapping of manacles
GUARD (CONT’D)
Right. Into the cage with you!
MAGNU:
No way, fur face!
SOUND: Chaos—struggling, crashing, ripping
BADGE:
Hold onto him! Keep him still!
MAGNU:
Hey, hey! Hands off, you pervert!
GUAR:
Get in the cage! Move!
MAGNU:
Hey! What are you doing? What’s with the leaves?
BADGE:
That’s right! Lock him up. We’ll decide what to do with him in the morning.
SOUND: Key in padlock, wooden cage opens and slams, lock clicks
MAGNU:
Hey! Get back here! I demand to speak to my lawyer!
HOLL:
Keep your voice down! You’ll wake the bears. They might decide they want a midnight snack.
MAGNU:
This is just great. Locked in irons and stuck in a cage with a lame fairy, waiting to be eaten by semiliterate bears. And that badger put something down my pants.
HOLL:
I saw. It’s poison ivy.
MAGNU:
That would explain the mild but growing itching sensation.
HOLL:
“Leaves of three, let them be.”
MAGNU:
I’ll be sure to remember that next time I’m being arrested. Aggh, it’s getting worse! This is a travesty of justice!
HOLL:
Well, you did steal all those herbs…
MAGNU:
Oh, don’t you get all high and mighty with me, “Thife”!
HOLL:
That was a misunderstanding!
MAGNU:
Aha.
HOLL:
And besides which, I was starving!
MAGNU:
I wonder why.
HOLL:
I’m not talking to you any more.
MAGNU:
Fine.
Silence.
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Gods it itches!
HOLL:
We really should get out of here.
MAGNU:
Ya think?
HOLL:
Do your wood-melting thing!
MAGNU:
My what?
HOLL:
You said you learned how back at the monastery.
MAGNU:
I was trying to heat up some food and kind of melted the table.
HOLL:
I see. Got any special martial arts moves for breaking out of cages?
MAGNU:
Yeah. But they involve not having my legs in shackles.
HOLL:
Great.
MAGNU:
How about you? Any bright ideas?
HOLL:
Well… I think the lashing on this side is coming apart. I tried budging it earlier but I couldn’t do it by myself. But if we both rock the cage back and forth…
MAGNU:
Hey, yeah. Okay. On three. One, two, three…
SOUND: Slight rhythmic creaking
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
No, no. We need to be in sync.
HOLL:
You’re going to and fro… you should be going fro and to.
MAGNU:
Whatever. One, two, three.
SOUND: Creaking
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
There we go!
HOLL:
Shhh!
MAGNU:
I think it’s working. It’s starting to give a little.
SOUND: Wood snaps
SOUND: Door, far distant
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Almost there…
PAP:
(far distant)
What’s going on out there?
HOLL:
Uh oh, there’s a light! I think someone heard us!
MAGNU:
It’s a bear. It’s three bears.
HOLL:
We’re gonna be a midnight snack!
MAGNU:
Go faster!
SOUND: Cracking and splintering
HOLL:
We did it!
MAGNU:
The door’s off. Quick, quick, make a run for it!
PAP:
(distant)
They’re getting away! Stop them!
MAGNU:
So long, suckers! Oof!
SOUND: Trip and fall
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
Holly! Holly, I can’t run in these leg irons!
HOLL:
Well, I can’t carry you!
MAGNU:
Please! Please, Holly, they’re gonna eat me!
HOLL:
Say you’re sorry.
MAGNU:
What?!
HOLL:
Say you’re sorry for stealing those herbs.
MAGNU:
Sorry to who? Badger’s not here.
HOLL:
To the universe.
MAGNU:
Holly…
HOLL:
Say it.
MAGNU:
I am sorry, O Universe. I am so sorry I stole a bunch of herbs from a nice badger who was only trying to make a living.
HOLL:
That’s better.
MAM:
(closing in)
Stop that fairy!
BAB:
(closing in)
Porridge stealer!
MAGNU:
Holly!
HOLL:
Hold onto my waist. Oh Mercury, help me…
SOUND: Erratic buzz of wings
HOLLY (CONT’D)
(fading into the distance)
Ow ow ow…
MAGNU:
(simultaneously)
Aaaaaa!
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
SOUND: Door and footsteps. morning birds outside.
HOLLY AND MAGNU:
(suspiciously cheerful)
Morning, Alba!
ALB:
What?
HOLL:
It’s good to see you.
MAGNU:
Yes. Isn’t it a lovely day.
ALB:
I suppose this is bad news.
HOLL:
No, no, we got your herbs and everything. Look!
SOUND: Rustling leaves
ALB:
What’s this supposed to be? Goldenrod?
HOLL:
Uh huh. It’s a… special variety they grow in the swamp.
ALB:
And this?
MAGNU:
That’s ginseng.
ALB:
This is a yam.
MAGNU:
It’s orange ginseng!
HOLL:
Sometimes known as false yam!
MAGNU:
Every herb a modern House of Healing needs.
ALB:
And not, say, a bag of ten random plants you stumbled on in the dark…
(accusing, in turn)
Magnus? Holly?
HOLL:
(beat, then breaks down)
I’m sorry, Alba.
ALB:
(sighs)
Never send a pair of dimwit assistants to do a witch’s job.
HOLL:
I’ll make it up to you. I’ll be your herbalist forever.
ALB:
Please don’t say that.
HOLL:
We need to make amends. What can we do?
MAGNU:
Uh… “we”?
ALB:
Well, there’s a stack of bedpans and chamber pots behind you that need cleaning out. And then you can start rebuilding the pantry.
HOLL:
Yes, Alba.
MAGNU:
Great.
ALB:
Consider yourself lucky. I’m off to Her Majesty’s surprise birthday party.
SOUND: Door slams
MAGNU:
I hate my life.
HOLL:
(beat)
Are you gonna eat that yam?

SOUND: Footsteps and bumping of stretcher
ALB:
(rushed)
Get him up on the table.
PATIEN:
(barely awake)
Ughhh….
HOLL:
You’re gonna be okay. Alba’s on the case, and you’re doing great.
SOUND: A thump
ALB:
Magnus, be more careful.
MAGNU:
Well, his head is huge!
ALB:
Holly, hook him up to the monitors, please.
HOLL:
On it.
MAGNU:
What we got, Doc?
ALB:
Patient is male, mid-fifties. Reported a headache this morning, and noticed the swelling later, along with dizziness and blurred vision.
SOUND: A little “tink!” at intevals, like a heartbeat monitor
MAGNU:
Hey, how come you didn’t use the tinky-tinky machine when you were healing me? My injuries were way more life-threatening.
HOLL:
Do we need to anaesthetize?
ALB:
No, but a silence spell would be great about now.
HOLL:
I meant the patient.
ALB:
He was self-medicating with plum brandy all morning.
MAGNU:
That’s what that smell is…
HOLL:
So his head isn’t supposed to be this big?
MAGNU:
What is wrong with him? Is it an abcess?
SOUND: Soft tapping
ALB:
Nope. See that? That’s bone. His actual cranium is enlarged.
SOUND: A scrunching, creaking noise, like something growing
MAGNU:
And getting larger.
HOLL:
Oh, that’s easy! He’s pregnant!
MAGNU:
Uh, humans don’t give birth through their foreheads, Holly.
HOLL:
Well, excuse me.
MAGNU:
See, this is why I have a problem with fairies doing medicine on people.
HOLL:
Fairies are people, monkey boy.
ALB:
Focus, please.
HOLL:
His pulse is strong and fast.
ALB:
So clearly, his humours are out of balance, with an excess of blood in the—
HOLL:
(puzzled)
Actually, the scroll says his humours are fine. Nothing out of balance at all.
ALB:
What? That can’t be right…
MAGNU:
I say we lance the swelling.
HOLL:
You always want to lance things and cut things open.
MAGNU:
Only ’cause it gets results. Once, I treated a guy who had this huge lump on his—
ALB:
(interrupting)
Medicine is detective work. We don’t go in with the scalpels and needles without knowing the root cause.
SOUND: Scrunch
MAGNU:
Boring… Whoa.
ALB:
Still growing.
HOLL:
Ew! That vein in his forehead!
MAGNU:
What happens when it gets too big?
HOLL:
I don’t want to know!
ALB:
It can’t be purple bloat, and it’s the wrong time of year for balloon worms.
MAGNU:
Maybe it’s a curse?
ALB:
Hmm. Good thought. Go and get the Orb of Hydrogenes from my office. (hi-DROD-jen-neez)
MAGNU:
And then can I lance him? Back at the monastery I had to save this monk who got a scratch on his arm from a zombie sloth and it bloated all up like a great big—
ALB:
Get me the Orb, Magnus.
MAGNU:
Fine. Promising young surgeon thwarted yet again.
SOUND: Scrunch
PATIEN:
Urgh…
HOLL:
Stay with us. You’re strong and healthy and you’re gonna beat this thing.
ALB:
Holly, I don’t think he even knows what you’re saying.
HOLL:
It’s called an affirmation. It strengthens the spirit.
MAGNU:
Is this the right orb?
ALB:
That’s the one.
SOUND: Magical shimmer
ALB:
Hmm… No sign of malevolent magic.
HOLL:
So what do we do?
ALB:
(beat)
I think we’d better lance the swelling.
MAGNU:
I’ll get the needles.
SOUND: The ominous scrunching, growing sound again
SOUND: Rattle of instruments
PATIEN:
Ughhhh…
HOLL:
(to patient)
You’re gonna be all right. You’re hale and hearty, and you’re gonna make it just fine.
MAGNU:
All right, my beauties. Who’s up for a little trip to the centre of the brain? Ten gauge? Eight gauge? Perhaps the one I like to call Ye Old Apple Corer?
ALB:
Standard gauge, number Four B.
MAGNU:
Your wish is my command. 70
ALB:
A little higher up, that’s it. Just behind the ear.
SOUND: A tiny, squishy noise, followed by a splatter of fluids
MAGNU:
Yeaaaaah.
HOLL:
Eww!
MAGNU:
Holly, if you can’t take the goo, get out of the operating room.
HOLL:
It’s glowing!
ALB:
Now that’s even stranger. Why is the cerebral fluid glowing?
MAGNU:
Dunno, but at least it should take the pressure off, shouldn’t it?
SOUND: The scrunching noise intensifies to dangerous levels, and the ongoing “tink tink” is quite RAPID NO:
ALB:
Or maybe not.
MAGNU:
Should I poke him again?
HOLL:
Oh gods!
ALB:
Get down!
SOUND: A messy, splattery explosion
MAGNUS AND HOLL:
(yell)
SOUND: Eerie silence—the “tink” noise has stopped. just the occasional drip
MAGNU:
Did you see that? That was awesome.
(beat)
But, you know, in a really bad way.
MUSIC: OPENING THEM:
HERAL:
By appointment to the King and Queen: Alba Salix, Royal Physician! Episode the Fourth: A Chance to Cure.
INT. RECEPTIO:
ALB:
I’m so very sorry, Mrs Strudebaker.
MRS S.
Thank you, Miss Salix. I’m sure you did everything you could.
ALB:
It was quick. And I’m quite certain he didn’t feel any pain.
MRS S.
The way he drank, he seldom did. Oh, Arthur. Poor, silly Arthur. I just knew he’d meet a bad end some day… Would it be all right if I see him?
ALB:
Not just yet.
SOUND: Interior door and clanking of buckets
MAGNU:
(passing through)
Good morning. Don’t mind me…
MRS S.
What’s in those buckets?
MAGNU:
Nothing! Nothing to see…
ALB:
(sotto voce)
Magnus, I told you to use the other door.
MRS S.
That sound earlier… He didn’t—Arthur didn’t explode, did he?
ALB:
Well, in a manner of speaking…
MRS S.
It would be just like him, you know.
SOUND: Exterior door
GERRAR:
(entering)
Help! This is an emergency!
MAGNU:
Whoa, check him out.
ALB:
Oh dear, not another one.
GERRAR:
Are you the Royal Physician?
ALB:
That’s me.
GERRAR:
My head is swelling. I need medical attention!
ALB:
All right, hold on to your hat. Sorry.
MRS S.
Is it an outbreak? Are we all going to explode?
GERRAR:
Who’s exploded?
MRS S.
My husband!
GERRAR:
Is this true? People have actually exploded?
ALB:
Well…
MAGNU:
Maybe.
ALB:
One.
MAGNU:
A little bit.
ALB:
We’re working to ascertain the cause.
GERRAR:
I demand to be treated this instant!
ALB:
Please stay calm, Sir.
GERRAR:
Do you know who I am?
ALB:
Yes, you’re that real estate man on all the signs around town.
GERRAR:
Carlton Gerrard, property developer. I own this town. And you’d better have a cure for this, this… whatever it is!
ALB:
Yes, yes, come this way. Magnus—
MAGNU:
Standard gauge Four B?
ALB:
No. You stay here and… see to Mrs Strudebaker.
MAGNU:
Three B?
SOUND: Door slams
MAGNU:
Dangit.
INT. OPERATING ROO:
SOUND: Bubbling and stirring, plus the tink! noise again
GERRAR:
So you have no idea what’s wrong with me.
ALB:
We’re working on it. Now, if you’d be so kind—
GERRAR:
I need answers!
ALB:
Have you been drinking, Mr Gerrard?
GERRAR:
Never touch the stuff. A man’s body is a temple. If I poisoned my mind with alcohol, I’d never have gotten this far—
ALB:
Just ruling out some possible factors. Any recent illnesses?
GERRAR:
None. I’m healthy as a horse. Haven’t missed a day of work in twenty-six years. And that includes weekends.
HOLL:
(hushed)
Alba, I’ve gone through the books… the symptoms are all wrong for brain galls.
ALB:
(hushed)
Damn.
HOLL:
But then I thought, what about a shrinking spell?
ALB:
Then he’d have a tiny head that’s still about to explode.
GERRAR:
What are you two muttering about? Get on with it!
HOLL:
It’s okay, Mr Gerrard! You’re healthy as a horse! You can beat this thing!
ALB:
You had to say it, didn’t you?
INT. RECEPTIO:
MRS S.
It’s a shame, really. We never saw enough of each other.
MAGNU:
Yeah, you mentioned.
MRS S.
It was the show business, you see. He was always on the road.
MAGNU:
Uh huh.
MRS S.
“Strudebaker the Magnificent”. The best stage magician who ever lived. Dazzlioni, Bagatelle… All those younger so-called illusionists, they stole every trick they know from my Arthur.
MAGNU:
But he didn’t do any real magic.
MRS S.
Oh, he dabbled a bit. And once he started losing his audience to those young upstarts, Arthur started hawking crystals and whatnot to make ends meet. Not that that ever worked.
MAGNU:
Wait a second. You said he was travelling?
MRS S.
Yes, he was just back from touring the west coast, down through Mediocria and the Pointy Lands. He caught some tropical disease out there, I just know it.
MAGNU:
You think?
MRS S.
I always warned him, don’t drink the water, and certainly don’t eat the food—that’s just asking for trouble.
MAGNU:
Sounds like a recipe for health.
MRS S.
But did he listen? Of course not. Always travelling, to all parts. Farloria, Balgomar, Eastrise… He went all over the place.
ALBA AND HOLL:
(both yell, off mic)
SOUND: A messy explosion in the other room
MAGNU:
Tell me about it.
MRS S.
And now he’s gone and exploded.
MAGNU:
Yeah. Listen, I gotta get back in the operating room.
(leaving)
We’ll have the undertaker call by your place, okay?
INT. OPERATING ROO:
SOUND: Dripping
HOLL:
(shellshocked)
I don’t understand it. We gave them pinchweed, elm bark…
ALB:
None of the incantations seemed to do anything.
SOUND: Door opens
MAGNU:
Another one blew and I missed it?
ALB:
Grab a mop.
MAGNU:
Yes ma’am.
ALB:
This is awful. Two patients lost in one day. And high profile patients at that.
MAGNU:
That’s a heck of a splatter radius. We should really put up some curtains or something.
HOLL:
Urghh…
SOUND: Mopping up
ALB:
But why these two? What did they have in common besides the symptoms?
HOLL:
Both male, both human…
MAGNU:
Both old, and kinda full of themselves.
HOLL:
You don’t know that.
MAGNU:
Hey, that’s what Mrs Strudebaker said. But more importantly, she says he probably picked up some tropical disease on tour.
ALB:
Really! Now that is interesting.
MAGNU:
See? Detective work.
ALB:
But how would Gerrard have caught it? He hasn’t left town in years.
HOLL:
Maybe he went to a magic show?
ALB:
Wait a second. What was that first thing you said, Magnus?
MAGNU:
Strudebaker was on tour in Melluria…
ALB:
No, about both patients being full of themselves. What if… what if that fluid in their brains was actually ego?
MAGNU:
You mean their heads got too big? Literally?
HOLL:
Oh no. That means…
ALB:
The egotistic fluid!
MAGNU:
The what?
ALB:
It’s only been a theory until now. This could be the first time it’s been isolated.
HOLL:
Oh my gosh it’s my fault. It’s all my fault.
ALB:
What is?
HOLL:
My affirmations. I told them both they were strong and they could fight it off. Oh gods, I fed their egos and now they’re both…
ALB:
I don’t think it was you, Holly.
HOLL:
(in tears)
I’m a bad fairy!
ALB:
Something out there is causing people’s brains to overproduce egotistic fluid. People with over-inflated egos will be the most susceptible.
SOUND: Desk bell, from the other room
HOLL:
Oh gods, it’s another one!
ALB:
We don’t know that yet.
(calling)
Be right with you!
PAG:
(at the door)
Forgive me, Miss Salix, but this is a dire emergency.
ALB:
Let me guess. Who’s sick?
PAG:
Her Majesty the Queen.
ALB:
Oh no. If anyone’s got an excess of egotistic fluid, it’s Parabel.
INT. PALAC:
GUAR:
State your business.
ALB:
Royal Physician and her assistant to see Queen Parabel.
GUAR:
Carry on.
SOUND: Gate opens; their voices and footsteps echo
HOLL:
(hushed)
I killed them, Alba!
ALB:
Nonsense. How were you to know?
HOLL:
I’ve killed two of your patients, oh, Alba… I don’t want to be a bad fairy.
ALB:
Well, help me with this, then. The salve you brought should induce melancholy, and on top of that we’ll both work on deflating her ego.
HOLL:
Both of us?
ALB:
We have to. It was always “me, me, me” when we were growing up… now she’s Queen she’s completely out of control. You should have seen her birthday party.
HOLL:
I saw the fireworks in the shape of her face.
ALB:
That’s Parabel for you. At dinner she had to have a different dress for every course.
HOLL:
I still don’t think I can be mean to her.
ALB:
Just keep your affirmations to yourself and leave the rest to me.
HOLL:
Okay.
ALB:
And don’t let on about the other cases. Don’t want to get her blood pressure up.
SOUND: Door opens; no more reverb
GUNTHE:
Alba, thank goodness you’re here.
PARABE:
Alba! You have to help me…
ALB:
Your Majesties. Oh, Parabel, for heaven’s sake, what have you done now?
PARABE:
Me? Me?!
ALB:
See what I mean?
PARABE:
So much for bedside manner.
ALB:
Holly, she’s got the same symptoms. Cranium is enlarged, warm to the touch…
HOLL:
Okay. I’ll have the unguent ready in a sec.
GUNTHE:
The same symptoms? There are other cases?
ALB:
(realizing her slip)
Yes. Two so far.
PARABE:
Oh, my head…
GUNTHE:
There, there, dear. You’re in good hands. You can overcome this—whatever it is.
PARABE:
And I’m too young and beautiful to die.
GUNTHE:
That goes without saying.
PARABE:
Oh, honey duckling…
HOLL:
(sotto voce)
Alba…
ALB:
Your Majesty, we’re going to have to be alone with the patient.
GUNTHE:
But Parabel is in a weakened state…
PARABE:
And my Gunther gives me strength to carry on.
ALB:
Sorry, but no. Your Majesty, I have to insist.
GUNTHE:
Very well. Courage, dear.
PARABE:
Oh, darling, I miss you already…
GUNTHE:
Be strong, my treasure.
ALB:
Out!
SOUND: Door closes
PARABE:
Alba, why do you always have to ruin things?
ALB:
It’s my job. Hold still.
PARABE:
Oh, it’s too awful. Don’t look! Stop looking at me!
ALB:
How am I supposed to cure you if I can’t look at you, you stupid girl?
PARABE:
You see? You always treat me like I’m still your baby sister.
ALB:
Well, if the slipper fits…
PARABE:
I’m Queen now, and you’re not. And you should show some respect. Isn’t that right, fairy?
HOLL:
I wouldn’t know. I don’t get involved in human affairs.
PARABE:
Where did you find her? Are you sure she’s a good fairy?
HOLL:
Okay, I have to apply this to your forehead now… hold still for me, Your Majesty.
(whispering, to Alba)
Can I still call her Your Majesty?
ALB:
It’s fine.
INT. RECEPTIO:
SOUND: Quiet squishing and scraping
MAGNU:
(to himself, as he works)
The upper jaw connected to the cheek bone. Cheek bone connected to the temporal bone. The temporal bone connected to the… Wait. No, you’re part of Gerrard’s skull, you should be in that pile. Temporal bone connected to… c’mon, where is it…
SOUND: Door opens
GU:
(bursting in)
A surgeon! Ho! A surgeon!
MAGNU:
(startled)
Alba’s not here right now… can I help you?
GU:
I need medical attention, on the instant!
MAGNU:
Everyone’s so demanding today.
GU:
I have been wounded in a duel. Pierced here and here with a poisoned blade.
MAGNU:
That looks pretty deep.
GU:
Are you a surgeon?
MAGNU:
Well, I… yes! Yes, I am the House of Healing’s resident surgeon. So… poisoned, huh?
GU:
Indeed.
MAGNU:
Well, I’m okay with the surgery, but poisons aren’t really my department—
SOUND: Shink! of a sword being drawn
GU:
Forbidden to heal a known outlaw, are you? Don’t worry. I won’t tell. And neither will you. How’s that for fair?
MAGNU:
I’ve got a better idea. Hyah!
SOUND: Flurry of limbs. sword clatters to the floor, then picked up
GU:
Oho! Clever move, monk.
MAGNU:
Nice sword. I like the weight.
SOUND: He gives the sword an experimental swing or two
GU:
Yes, isn’t it nice? That’s why I always carry a spare.
SOUND: Shink!
MAGNU:
Well, aren’t you a tactical genius.
GU:
I hate to boast, but yes.
SOUND: Swords clash
MAGNU:
I trained in the Monastery of Dragon Mountain, for your information.
GU:
I’d guessed by the robes. But by the way you fight, I surmise you didn’t actually train for very long, did you?
MAGNU:
That’s a special technique to keep you off your guard. Haaa!
GU:
Really! I thought it was to get me to take pity on you.
SOUND: They fight, blades whirling and furnishings smashing, until…
SOUND: A wire whips through the air
MAGNU:
Glrk!
GU:
Drop the sword, little brother.
MAGNU:
(strangling)
Okay.
SOUND: Sword drops to the floor
GU:
Guy Van Fleet is the name. I’ve killed two men today, so I have a few to go to keep up my average.
MAGNU:
(awestruck)
You’re Guy Van Fleet? The highwayman?
GU:
No, Guy Van Fleet the scullery maid. You, young sirrah, will find me a remedy for this poison, and bind the wounds. Yes?
MAGNU:
That sounds like a good deal.
GU:
Now, as a little incentive, I should warn you that the wire around your neck is enchanted. I call it a dead man’s garrotte. If you’re wearing it and, let’s say, something happens and I die…
MAGNU:
(as the garrotte tightens)
Hurk!
GU:
…there goes your head.
MAGNU:
Uhhh…!
GU:
Now, let’s see about this poison, shall we?
MAGNU:
The pantry’s this way.
GU:
Good. And remember. I die…
MAGNU:
Hlgk!
GU:
…you die.
MAGNU:
Ingenious!
INT. PALAC:
SOUND: Dabbing and squishing
ALB:
Any change?
HOLL:
No… I tripled the strength of the salve, but it’s still not doing anything.
SOUND: Scrunching noise
PARABE:
I knew I should have summoned Krankel sooner.
ALB:
That horrid little phony?
PARABE:
Why did we ever make you Royal Physician?
ALB:
Oh, I don’t know—for saving your life and Gunther’s?
PARABE:
And now I’m about to die because of you!
ALB:
It’s not my fault your head is swollen!
PARABE:
Oh? Whose fault is it?
HOLL:
It’s yours.
PARABE:
(speechless for a moment)
Well, I never!
HOLL:
(steeling herself)
It’s true. You’ve brought this on yourself.
PARABE:
How dare you address me like that. I’m your Queen.
HOLL:
See! And that’s the problem! You’ve let it go to your head.
PARABE:
Just who do you think you are?
HOLL:
I’m… I’m a good fairy who knows what’s best for you… Your Majesty.
PARABE:
It’s bad enough I have to listen to my domineering older sister.
ALB:
When have you ever listened to anything I’ve told you?
PARABE:
You don’t even have any natural talent.
ALB:
Unlike you, of course.
PARABE:
One happens to be the third daughter of a third daughter.
HOLL:
Well, why aren’t you out healing people, then?
ALB:
Good one.
PARABE:
Because I’m Queen, and I have more important duties!
ALB:
Such as?
PARABE:
Such as ruling, and representing Farloria to the world, and inspecting the Royal Constabulary…
HOLL:
But anyone could do that.
PARABE:
I’ve had enough of your impertinence, fairy.
(calling)
Guards!
HOLL:
(cracking)
I’m only saying it because otherwise you’re going to die, just like the others!
PARABE:
(stunned, then)
Die? People have been dying?
ALB:
So much for keeping that under wraps.
HOLL:
I’m sorry, but yes. We had two other cases like this today and they both…
PARABE:
What?
ALB:
Had complications.
HOLL:
(simultaneously)
Exploded.
PARABE:
And you couldn’t save them?
ALB:
If we’d saved them, they wouldn’t have… had complications.
PARABE:
Oh, gods, I’m too young to explode!
HOLL:
There’s no such thing. You… You’re not strong enough and you can’t possibly fight this!
PARABE:
Where’s Krankel? Summon the Sorceror General!
INT. OPERATING ROO:
GU:
Aaaaarghh!
MAGNU:
Seriously, I can give you a local if you want.
GU:
I prefer the pain. It’s good for you. Makes you feel alive.
MAGNU:
How’s the numbness?
GU:
Completely gone.
MAGNU:
That’s good then. The antidote’s working.
(to himself)
Thank the gods.
GU:
Arghh!
MAGNU:
So, close call, huh?
GU:
Hardly. I’ve survived far worse than this. When I broke into Castle Coconella, I slew twelve of the Duke’s elite guards with nothing but a lead pipe, and that with my hands tied behind my back.
MAGNU:
You’re kidding.
GU:
All in a day’s work for the kingdom’s most feared outlaw.
MAGNU:
Say, you haven’t felt any swelling in the, uh, head region, have you?
GU:
No… why do you ask?
MAGNU:
Just making sure it’s not.. something else. Okay, that’s the right side done. Turn this way and I’ll get that other wound allll sewed up.
GU:
It’s “sewn”.
MAGNU:
Yeah, I was just being, you know, colloquial. You know how we hardened criminals are.
GU:
Of course.
MAGNU:
So I was just thinking, if you ever need more help, you know, in future, with break-ins or hold-ups or anything, ’cause I trained at the Monastery of Dragon Mountain where I learned to fight plus a lot of other useful skills such as sewing up stab wounds and splinting broken limbs and I’m also pretty good at mopping floors and… oh and I broke out of prison once! Well okay, a cage, anyway, I haven’t actually killed anyone before although I’m working my way up to it, I mean, I came pretty close this one time but yeah maybe it’s best to leave that kind of stuff to you since you’re the… expert…
A long pause.
MAGNUS (CONT’D)
I’ll just get you stitched up now.
GU:
Yes, that would be best.
INT. BEDROO:
SOUND: Door opens
HERAL:
(entering)
The Sorceror General to see you, Majesty!
KRANKE:
Your Majesty.
PARABE:
Oh, Mister Krankel—!
KRANKE:
Doctor Krankel.
PARABE:
Thank heavens you’re here. Alba says I’m dying.
KRANKE:
Indeed. I came as soon as I could. Excuse me, ladies.
ALB:
Not at all.
KRANKE:
Good heavens. This is quite worrying.
PARABE:
(frightened)
Ohh!
KRANKE:
If your Majesty would be so kind as to hold this cup while I fill it with thrice-distilled spirit of amber.
SOUND: Clasps on a bag being opened
SOUND: Flask opened and poured into a metal cup
ALB:
And what is this meant to achieve?
KRANKE:
A proper diagnosis. Observe the ripples on the surface of the liquid. Yes, it appears Your Majesty’s physical form has been distorted by mystical means.
ALB:
We’ve already tested for curses.
KRANKE:
Not necessarily a curse—possibly an accident. Let me see, now…
INT. OPERATING ROO:
GU:
Nnghhh!
MAGNU:
There we go. Just gotta tie that off…
SOUND: Snip of scissors; needle dropped into a tray
MAGNU:
And we’re done.
GU:
Good work, Brother Magnus.
MAGNU:
Hey, any time.
GU:
You may be young, but you could be quite a fine surgeon.
MAGNU:
Well, you know, I—gurk!
GU:
Which is why it’s a shame I have to kill you.
INT. PALAC:
KRANKE:
See how the ripples cross now—the sign for water.
PARABE:
I must be taking on too much water!
HOLL:
That’s not what it means! Your Majesty.
KRANKE:
Hmm. Water can also refer to reflection or refraction…
PARABE:
Like a mirror?
KRANKE:
Quite. Has Your Majesty seen anything unusual in a mirror today?
PARABE:
In a mirror…
ALB:
Or glass or a crystal?
PARABE:
(suddenly guilty)
A crystal?
HOLL:
Like this crystal?
PARABE:
Oh, that silly old thing.
KRANKE:
A Prystorchion crystal! How did Your Majesty come to possess such an item?
PARABE:
It was a gift!
KRANKE:
Let me see. Yes, an impure specimen. Very dangerous. Your Majesty wasn’t attempting to work magic with this, I hope?
PARABE:
No, no, of course not.
ALB:
Then how do you explain this little pamphlet on “Your Crystal Clear Path To Prosperity”?
PARABE:
I have no idea where that came from.
HOLL:
Yeah right!
ALB:
(surprised)
Holly!
HOLL:
I can’t stop it, Alba! All these mean words are coming out by themselves now.
PARABE:
I found out how much my birthday party cost and I just felt so guilty… I didn’t want the kingdom to go broke on my account.
ALB:
Where did you get the crystal, Parabel?
PARABE:
I bought it from that traveling magician, Strudebaker.
ALB:
Aha!
PARABE:
I did the ritual from the pamphlet and I saw myself reflected in the crystal, with my head all bulging… I looked hideous!
HOLL:
Not much of a change, then!
ALB:
That’s enough, Holly.
KRANKE:
As I thought—just look at that curvature.
PARABE:
Well, yes, but… Doctor Krankel, this is hardly the time!
KRANKE:
Definitely flawed. Typically one would use it in a spell to attract certain energetic patterns such as money… but an impure crystal can cause feedback, distorting the mental anchor, specifically the spell-caster’s own head.
PARABE:
Am I going to die?
KRANKE:
By no means, Your Majesty. Now that we know the mechanism behind your malady, breaking the spell is as simple as—
SOUND: Crystal smashes, followed by the sound of the magic spell dissipating
SOUND: The scrunching noise
PARABEL AND HOLL:
(gasp)
KRANKE:
—breaking the crystal.
ALB:
Why didn’t I think of that?
KRANKE:
Well, not everyone can be an expert on magical healing.
HOLL:
You lay off Alba, you smug bully!
KRANKE:
Miss Salix, you ought to curb your fairy minion.
HOLL:
Minion? You’re a minion!
INT. OPERATING ROO:
MAGNU:
(choking)
Gack! No, you don’t have to do kill me! I won’t tell, honest…
GU:
I’m a wanted man, you see. I rode seven miles out of my way to avoid being followed here. I won’t be caught because some foolish boy couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
MAGNU:
I won’t tell. I won’t tell anyone.
(the noose tightens)
Honest! If I tell anyone you can kill me, but I won’t, I really won’t! And hey, if you ever need healing after a big job goes down, I’m your guy… Guy.
Pause.
GU:
That’s not a bad point, you know.
MAGNU:
Free of charge!
GU:
Very well, then. Just remember—I have eyes and ears everywhere.
MAGNU:
Gurk!
GU:
And if you breathe a word to anyone about this, you can bet that what’s left of your miserable life will make the fires of Hell look like a vacation on the Meyurian Riviera.
MAGNU:
Absolutely! Fires of Hell!
SOUND: Wire whips through the air as it’s retracted
MAGNU:
(gasping)
Oh thank the gods.
GU:
Farewell, and remember…
MAGNU:
Not a word!
SOUND: Door opens and shuts
GU:
(from outside)
Hiyo Arsenic, away!
SOUND: His horse whinnies and breaks into a gallop, fading
MAGNU:
Thanks Guy!
(sighs)
You’re the best!
INT. PALAC:
PARABE:
Oh… oh dear, it aches…
KRANKE:
You see? Your Majesty is already returning to a normal, healthy tiara size.
ALB:
When are you going to learn not to meddle with things you don’t understand?
KRANKE:
With respect, Majesty, I must concur with your sister. These magics are not to be trifled with—
PARABE:
I’m a third daughter of a third daughter! I have the gift!
ALB:
Of stupidity, clearly!
HOLL:
Clearly.
PARABE:
The Royal Physician and her assistant are dismissed.
KRANKE:
Good day to you, Miss Salix.
ALB:
Shove it, wizard.
HOLL:
Minion.
KRANKE:
Majesty, if I may—
PARABE:
You too! All of you! Get out of my INT. bedroom!
KRANKE:
Yes, Majesty.
HOLL:
And Your Majesty’s head is still too big!
SOUND: Door slams
EXT. ROAD—SOON AFTE:
SOUND: Daytime birds and insects
ALB:
We’ll have to put out a public health bulletin—there may be more crystals out there.
HOLL:
Do you think Mr Gerrard had one too?
ALB:
I’d heard he was in bad shape financially. He was trying to build a new planned borough on the edge of town but it fizzled. He must have turned to magic to get himself out of debt.
HOLL:
So it had nothing to do with their egos at all.
ALB:
Not directly.
HOLL:
So we were just insulting the Queen for nothing.
ALB:
That was satisfying, at least.
HOLL:
(sighs)
I’m such a bad fairy.
ALB:
Nonsense. Have your wings and skin turned grey?
HOLL:
Um… no, not yet.
ALB:
Teeth?
HOLL:
(she checks)
Still not pointed.
ALB:
I think you’ll be fine.
HOLL:
I still have some good deeds to perform for you. Though I understand if you don’t want me to…
ALB:
Well… to tell the truth, you’ve been a lot of help.
HOLL:
Really?
ALB:
Verging on useful.
HOLL:
Aww. Thank you, Alba!
ALB:
Don’t mention it.
HOLL:
We’re like a team now!
ALB:
Maybe I can still get Parabel to fire me.

Brother Magnus, chief surgeon and special assistant to Mister Guy Van Fleet. Heh.
(mimics a whirling sword)
Whuppa-whup-whup! This is a dead man’s garrotte. One move and kchrkk!
SOUND: Door opens
HOLL:
(entering)
The team! The team that cares! The team that heals! Together!
MAGNU:
Oh, hey, guys.
ALB:
Magnus, I thought I told you to clean up around here.
MAGNU:
I was just getting to that.
ALB:
Have you called the undertaker?
MAGNU:
In fact, that’s the very next thing on my list.
ALB:
All the instruments are just lying out. And what happened to the chairs in here?
HOLL:
Are those sword marks?
MAGNU:
Uh…
ALB:
Honestly, Magnus, what have you been doing for the past two hours?
MAGNU:
I’ve been busy…
ALB:
What, having a duel on top of the reception desk?
HOLL:
Ha! And then stitching up the other guy afterward?
MAGNU:
Maybe I was. You don’t know.
ALB:
Is that what happened?
MAGNU:
…no, of course not. Ha. That would be ridiculous.
ALB:
Well, get back to work. This place is a disaster.
HOLL:
Kinda like you! Sorry! Sorry!
SOUND: Interior door slams
INT. OFFIC:
PARABE:
I came to apologize for throwing you out. I called you terrible names and behaved like a spoilt child after you’d just saved my life. And I shouldn’t have been meddling with magic, of course, although I was only trying to help our kingdom.
KRANKE:
Your Majesty, there is no need to apologize. It was a stressful situation.
PARABE:
But you were right, of course. It was foolish of me to try to practice without the proper study and understanding.
KRANKE:
And is that perhaps the other reason for Your Majesty’s visit?
PARABE:
What do you mean, Doctor Krankel?
KRANKE:
Do I gather that Your Majesty seeks to… develop her inborn gifts?
PARABE:
Gifts? Oh, you mean that nonsense about being the third daughter of a third daughter.
KRANKE:
It would be a pleasure to help shape such a prodigious natural talent as your Majesty’s.
PARABE:
It’s nothing, really.
KRANKE:
But if I may—why not go to your sister instead?
PARABE:
Do you really think she’d teach me? She doesn’t trust anyone, least of all her little sister. Do you know she says you’re plotting to take over the kingdom?
KRANKE:
How very amusing, Majesty. Probably best not to tell her about this, then.
PARABE:
Oh, gods, of course not. Alba can get stuffed.
KRANKE:
Indeed. Shall we begin?

(bored)
Hi, we’re from the House of Healing. Have you had your immunization for pony pox? Hi, we’re from the House of Healing…
ALB:
Good afternoon. Oh, hello, Professor Schpringeler.
SCHPRINGELE:
Hello Alba. I came to ask: my neighbour has been taking a potion for his lumbago, and I was wondering if you stock it?
ALB:
What kind of potion?
SCHPRINGELE:
I believe it’s called Frinozipax.
ALB:
(suddenly chilly)
We don’t stock it.
SCHPRINGELE:
I’m told the results it provides are quite astounding.
ALB:
Last visit, I gave you a herbal tea and some exercises.
SCHPRINGELE:
Why, yes…
ALB:
And how are those going?
SCHPRINGELE:
I haven’t really had time…
ALB:
You people! Everybody just wants a pill or a potion or some other easy way out. Try eating better! Get outside a little. Don’t drink so much mead.
SCHPRINGELE:
I’ll do my best. So, do you think you’ll carry Frinozipax any time soon?
ALB:
I don’t care if it cures leprosy and straightens out crossed eyes. We don’t carry it.
SCHPRINGELE:
All right then.
ALB:
Honestly, if I ever get my hands on whoever is shilling this stuff…
WITHRO:
Alba?
ALB:
Yes?
WITHRO:
It is you!
MAGNU:
Who?
WITHRO:
Alba, you’re looking fantastic.
ALB:
Withrow Lee? What are you doing in Grandville?
WITHRO:
Oh, I’m just in town for a conference. Who’s this kid and why is he dressed like a monk?
ALB:
My apprentice Magnus. He used to be with the Dragon Mountain order.
MAGNU:
Hey, hey, no “used to be”.
ALB:
Magnus, this is Withrow. He’s a… an old friend.
WITHRO:
Oh, “friend”, is it?
ALB:
Well, all right, we were more than that.
WITHRO:
Boy, were we!
MAGNU:
Okay, say no more.
WITHRO:
Back in the day, we were the Diabolical Duo… the Paranormal Pair—
MAGNU:
Let me guess, you met making stone tools down by the watering hole?
WITHRO:
Oh, a wise guy, huh? We met at Hazelbrooke.
MAGNU:
You went to witch school?
WITHRO:
Darn tootin’.
MAGNU:
Did you learn any cool dark magic?
WITHRO:
Oh, I could tell you some stories—
ALB:
Dark magic was strictly forbidden.
MAGNU:
In other words, your school was lame.
ALB:
It was not lame.
WITHRO:
Says the girl who dropped out to protest the curriculum.
(to Magnus)
She turned the Headmistress’s chair into a beanbag before storming out.
MAGNU:
A beanbag?
WITHRO:
Full of carnivorous Mellurian jumping beans.
MAGNU:
Okay, that’s pretty good. See, why can’t you teach me stuff like that, Alba?
ALB:
You have to ask? Well, it’s been nice to see you, Withrow—
PATIEN:
Excuse me. Miss Salix?
ALB:
Yes? How can I help you?
PATIEN:
Do you carry Frinozipax?
WITHRO:
Frinozipax? Funny you should ask—
ALB:
No, we don’t. It’s useless pap for useless people. Go away.
PATIEN:
Oh. Thanks anyway.
WITHRO:
Softhearted as ever, I see.
ALB:
Fifty crowns says it’s just elderflowers and molasses. But that’s the power of suggestion for you.
MAGNU:
Whoever’s selling it, I bet they’re making a killing.
ALB:
And if I ever find out who they are, I’m going to stuff them headfirst into a pill bottle.
WITHRO:
(changing the subject)
So, Royal Physician, eh? Not too shabby…
ALB:
Oh, yes. It’s great fun running the neighbourhood clinic and the national health policy office, on top of tending to whichever Royal Majesty stubs their little toe. And here I am on my supposed day off, running a booth at the market. And I have to file a report with the Chancellor tomorrow about the state of local witch-run clinics in the countryside.
WITHRO:
That’s my Alba, always the overachiever. Why don’t you take a break?
ALB:
Don’t I wish.
MAGNU:
I can take care of the booth.
ALB:
You?
WITHRO:
C’mon, Alba! Get some fresh air. It’s market day!
ALB:
Oh… all right. Magnus, take over for me. And no skipping off this time.
MAGNU:
You can count on me.

EXT. MARKE:
SOUND: Lively crowd
WITHRO:
I always love the market. The food, the hustle and bustle…
ALB:
The easy marks?
WITHRO:
Hey, now, my business these days is strictly above board.
ALB:
I see.
VENDO:
(distant)
Candy apples, three pennies each! Two for fivepence!
WITHRO:
Hey, you want a candy apple? They were always your favourite.
ALB:
I don’t like that woman. She lives with her father and treats him like garbage.
WITHRO:
Just this once. Here.
VENDO:
Candy apples!
WITHRO:
We’ll take two.
VENDO:
Certainly, sir.
WITHRO:
Thanks. Here you go, Alba.
VENDO:
That’ll be five pennies, please.
WITHRO:
Can you break a sovereign?
VENDO:
Not a problem. You want it in shillings?
SOUND: Jingling coins
WITHRO:
That’d be great. Actually, hang on. Give me four shillings and… no, wait, make that three shillings and twelve ducats.
VENDO:
(confused)
Twelve?
WITHRO:
Oh, silly me. I can’t do math. Twelve plus thirty-three and one is eight… so why don’t I give you back one and you give me five ducats, three groats and a crown?
VENDO:
Uh… of course.
WITHRO:
Keep the change.
VENDO:
Really? Thank you, sir.
WITHRO:
Have a lovely day.
VENDO:
And the same to you and the lady.
WITHRO:
(to Alba)
There you go.
ALB:
(amused)
Strictly above board, eh?
WITHRO:
She won’t figure that out for hours. Maybe never.
ALB:
You really haven’t changed, have you?
WITHRO:
Did you miss me?
ALB:
Not in the least.
WITHRO:
Yeah, you did.
ALB:
Eat your apple, you.
EXT. MARKET BOOT:
HOLL:
(arriving)
Hi, sorry I’m late! Hey Magnus, where’s Alba?
MAGNU:
She went off with her old boyfriend. And when I say old…
HOLL:
Aww, she has a boyfriend? Is he nice?
MAGNU:
Say, Holly… have you heard of this new potion, Frinozipax?
HOLL:
Yeah, everyone’s asking about it lately. I think it’s a scam.
MAGNU:
It totally is. We should sell something like that.
HOLL:
You are not selling placebos!
MAGNU:
Okay, we can throw in some ingredients or whatever. How about this stuff?
SOUND: Bottle clinks
HOLL:
No! I told you, we’re almost out of sludgewort.
MAGNU:
So don’t use so much per dose. Spread it around. If we could crank it out in big batches, we’d sell hundreds of bottles. Thousands!
HOLL:
That’s not how the House of Healing works!
MAGNU:
Which is why we’ve been missing the boat. Look, I’ll just use a tiny drop.
SOUND: Bottle corked and shaken
JEROME.
(stuffy nose)
Hey there, Holly. Hi Magnus.
HOLL:
Hello, Jerome!
JEROM:
Is Alba around? I need something for the shrew flu.
MAGNU:
Why, if it’s the shrew flu you’ve got, sludgewort is the best relief.
JEROM:
This doesn’t look like sludgewort extract…
MAGNU:
(improvising)
Because it isn’t! It’s what we healing experts call an essence. Did you know that dilution actually increases the effectiveness?
HOLL:
(quietly)
Magnus! That’s ridiculous!
MAGNU:
In fact, the more times we dilute, the stronger the essence becomes.
JEROM:
Really.
HOLL:
That’s not how it—
(as Magnus covers her mouth)
mff mmblff!
MAGNU:
You’re a blacksmith, right? You know how my fellow monks of Dragon Mountain make their swords?
JEROM:
What, by folding the metal over and over…?
MAGNU:
And beating it thinner and thinner. Keeping it lightweight and making it amazingly strong.
HOLL:
And you say I’m full of woo woo.
JEROM:
That’s incredible. How come you don’t do that with all your potions?
MAGNU:
It’s a brand new technique. Everyone knows about the fantastic healing properties of the humble sludgewort plant. But it took the genius of Miss Alba Salix to realize that by diluting it, you multi-amplify its potential by a factor of one hundred-fold!
JEROM:
Wow!
MAGNU:
Here, give it a try.
JEROME.
(drinks)
Ahh. I think I feel better already.
MAGNU:
See, Holly, he feels better already.
HOLL:
(leaving)
I’m telling Alba.
JEROME.
(sneezes again)
MAGNU:
That’ll be three crowns.
JEROM:
Alba never charges that much for potions.
MAGNU:
This is our first premium product offering. If you have any side effects, we’ll give you double your money back! How about it?
JEROM:
Well, okay.
SOUND: Coins
WALLA: Excited crowd
MAGNU:
Thank you, my good man. Here you go.
JEROM:
Thanks. Tell Alba I said hello!
MAGNU:
Sludgewort essence, only three crowns a pop! Hello there, ma’am. How are you feeling today?
EXT. RIVERSID:
SOUND: The market fades as they walk; distant seagulls
ALB:
So Withrow, what’s this conference you’re here for? The big magic exhibition isn’t until November…
WITHRO:
Yeah, this is just a… sales conference.
(changing the subject)
Hey, want to head up to the bridge?
ALB:
Hmm. It’s not exactly the greatest neighbourhood on the other side.
WITHRO:
We don’t have to cross. We’ll just go up to the lookout.
ALB:
All right.
WITHRO:
Anyway, it’s not like you couldn’t defend yourself. Remember Scotty Gostrinder?
ALB:
Oh, gods, the “Chosen One”?
WITHRO:
Hazelbrooke’s greatest boy hero.
ALB:
He defeated one lousy hydra…
WITHRO:
And then he was dumb enough to challenge you to a magic duel. And before he could get his first spell out you up and hit him in the face.
ALB:
Smug little creep.
(pause)
Withrow, why did you have to go and tell my apprentice about our… school days?
WITHRO:
Why not? That was our finest hour!
ALB:
Now he’s going to be all excited to learn about dark magic.
WITHRO:
Hmm. Reminds me of this girl I used to have a thing for.
ALB:
You were the one always trying to summon demons.
WITHRO:
They’re not all evil.
ALB:
No, just most of them.
WITHRO:
And it wasn’t all dark magic. Lots of it was just being creative. Remember the sneezing powder in Mrs Saraling’s spellbook?
ALB:
That was a good one.
WITHRO:
She turned half the class into slugs.
ALB:
The only time I saw her madder was when you set all the exam papers in the room on fire.
WITHRO:
Yup. Accende meum ignem! (a‑CHEN-day MAY-oom IG-nem)
ALB:
Careful, now!
WITHRO:
It’s okay. I didn’t do the hand motions.
SOUND: Footsteps stop
ALB:
It is a nice view, isn’t it?
WITHRO:
You can see clear out to the Sea of Squidge.
ALB:
Beautiful. You know, I’ve lived in this city for years now, and never bothered to come up here.
WITHRO:
Maybe you should get out of that House of Healing more often.
ALB:
I really should.
SOUND: Blade being drawn
MUGGE:
Hold it right there.
WITHRO:
Can we help you?
MUGGE:
Yeah. Put your hands in the air. You stay quiet like mouses and nobody has to get hurt.
(beat)
What?
EXT. MARKET BOOT:
WALLA: Excited crowd—“hey, quit shoving!” “stay in line!”
SOUND: Coins
MAGNU:
Thank you, sir. Enjoy. Step right up, don’t be shy!
BERTH:
I’ll take some of that sludgewort.
MAGNU:
You bet. That’ll be six crowns.
BERTH:
Six?!
MAGNU:
Supply and demand, lady.
ANGI:
(from back of line)
Hey, hurry it up!
WALLA: Mutterings of agreement
SOUND: Rummaging in crate
MAGNU:
Oh, shoot. That was my last bottle.
(to crowd)
Hey, anybody got any empties? Or your own container? Half price if you drink it on the spot!
SOUND: Bottles clink
URCHI:
I got some empties here.
MAGNU:
Awesome. You, sir, are a fine, enterprising young gentleman. I’ll give you a nice shiny crown for ’em.
URCHI:
Make it five.
MAGNU:
Five crowns?
URCHI:
Each.
MAGNU:
What?!
URCHI:
Supply and demand.
ANGI:
What’s taking so long?
MAGNU:
One crown each.
URCHI:
Four. Take it or leave it.
MAGNU:
I’m not paying you four crowns for one bottle!
URCHI:
Oh well. See ya.
MAGNU:
No, wait! I’ll… Here.
SOUND: Coins counted out, scooped up
SOUND: Bottles clink
URCHI:
Nice doing business with you!
MAGNU:
Kids these days.
BERTH:
So if diluting this stuff makes it stronger, shouldn’t we water it down even more before we take it?
MAGNU:
Yes, that’s a great idea. How many bottles you want?
BERTH:
In that case, I guess, just the one. It should last us years, right?
MAGNU:
No, because… it doesn’t keep!
ANGI:
Bertha, here—I’ll give you half, and we can split the bottle.
CHARLI:
Hey, count me in. The more ways we split it…
BERTH:
All right. Each of you gimme two crowns, and come by my kitchen. I’ll give you your share.
MAGNU:
No! That’s not allowed! This is a specialized process done by specialized specialists. Do not attempt to water down this complex formula at home. Home dilutions are killing magic!
BERTH:
Here’s your six crowns.
MAGNU:
Not if you’re gonna split it. That’s twelve, no, eighteen crowns.
BERTH:
Say, let’s talk to Henry. He bought a bottle earlier. Maybe he’ll share.
MAGNU:
Where are you going? Hey! I just paid forty crowns for these damn bottles! Hey!
WALLA: Crowd dispersing
EXT. RIVERSID:
MUGGE:
I’m serious. Your money or your life.
ALB:
I’m thinking neither.
MUGGE:
C’mon. All your valuables in the bag or I start gettin’ expressive with this here pigsticker. What’s so funny?
WITHRO:
Oh, nothing.
ALB:
Potes volare! (PO-tays vo-LA-ray)
SOUND: Magic shimmer
MUGGE:
(hauled off his feet)
Aaaa!
WITHRO:
I was thinking maybe turning him to ice, but levitation’s pretty good.
MUGGE:
Please! I’m afraid of heights!
ALB:
Mm, this bridge is a bit tall, isn’t it?
WITHRO:
Majestically tall.
ALB:
Quite a long way down to the river.
MUGGE:
I’ll do anything…
ALB:
Hush, now. You wouldn’t want me to lose my concentration and… drop you.
MUGGE:
(falls, then stops with a jerk)
AaaaAA!
WITHRO:
(calling down to him)
You ought to be more careful who you try and rob.
MUGGE:
I didn’t know she was a witch!
ALB:
(calling)
What does that matter? You don’t rob people.
MUGGE:
Okay, okay! I’m sorry! I’ll… I’ll turn my life around!
(he plummets suddenly)
Aaaa!
(distant)
Please!
WITHRO:
Ha, look at him. For a second there I thought you were gonna let him fall that whole way.
ALB:
From up here? It’d kill him. From halfway down… well, it’ll hurt, but he’ll be fine.
MUGGE:
Aaaaaaa…!
SOUND: Splash
ALB:
Probably.
WITHRO:
Maybe you should take up crime-fighting as a new hobby.
ALB:
I’ve missed doing that kind of magic. Whew. Except for the headache and shortness of breath.
WITHRO:
Short of breath, you say? Have you ever tried Frinozipax?
ALB:
Tried what? Oh, don’t tell me you’re on the bandwagon too.
WITHRO:
I’m… kind of the local sales rep for Farloria.
ALB:
Really. All right. So what’s in it?
WITHRO:
It’s an all-natural herbal formula—
ALB:
So is stewed pimple grass.
WITHRO:
No, this is the real deal. Not only does it relieve pain, it brings down inflammation, evens out your complexion, and it’s great for ulcers too. Here.
SOUND: Bottle uncorked
ALB:
You make this?
WITHRO:
I’m a distributor. I can send some your way if you’re interested. It’ll add ten years to your life. And take ten years off your age!
ALB:
Okay, knock it off with the sales pitch.
(swallows)
Tastes all right. That’s usually a bad sign. Hmmm. You might be on to something, though…
WITHRO:
How’s that headache?
ALB:
It works fast, doesn’t it?
WITHRO:
Quicker than the caffeinated beavers of Lake Zoom.
ALB:
All right, I’m impressed.
WITHRO:
Come by my room at the inn and I can give you a whole lot more.
ALB:
Buy a lady dinner first?
WITHRO:
Why, naturally.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
ALB:
So, Mr McWhinney, what can I help you with today?
MCWHINNE:
Well, I’ve got this toothache, and a ringing in my ears whenever I open my eyes…
ALB:
Have you tried Frinozipax?
MCWHINNE:
Tried what?
ALB:
It’s an all-natural herbal formula. Not only does it relieve pain, it boosts your stamina, balances your humours, and it’s great for warts…
SOUND: Office door shuts
HOLL:
Is she going to prescribe that stuff to every single patient?
MAGNU:
Sure sounds that way.
HOLL:
I’ve gotta find out what’s in it.
MAGNU:
Me too.
HOLL:
You are not touching this stuff. Remember what Alba said.
MAGNU:
Figures. I’m not allowed to have a side business. But her old flame comes to town selling junk potions and she’s all over him like mice on gingerbread.
HOLL:
How are those bedpans coming?
MAGNU:
I think this violates the terms of my community service.
SOUND: Exterior door
AB:
Good morning, little lady. I have an appointment with Miss Salix.
HOLL:
It’s Abe, right? Just fill out this patient information form, and Alba will see you in a minute.
SOUND: Office door
ALB:
…so try the Frinozipax for a week and let me know if there’s any change.
MCWHINNE:
Thanks, Miss Salix.
ALB:
Bye now.
SOUND: Office door shuts.
MCWHINNE:
Abe! Fancy meeting you here.
AB:
Hey there, McWhinney.
MCWHINNE:
Never thought I’d see you at the doctor’s office.
AB:
Yeah, got an ulcer, I think.
MCWHINNE:
An ulcer, you say? Have you ever tried Frinozipax?
AB:
Rhinocer-what?
MCWHINNE:
It’s an all-natural herbal potion made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients.
AB:
And it cures ulcers?
MCWHINNE:
Yup, it’s the real deal. Not only does it relieve pain, it brings down inflammation, evens out your complexion, and it’s great for ulcers too.
AB:
Really!
MAGNU:
That’s exactly what Alba said to the guy before last.
HOLL:
This is creepy. I need to test this stuff. Alba!
SOUND: Office door
ALB:
Send in the next patient, Holly.
HOLL:
Alba, what exactly are the active ingredients in Frinozipax?
ALB:
Why, it’s an all-natural herbal formula made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients.
HOLL:
And why are they so secret?
MAGNU:
Say, I hear it’s great for headaches.
HOLL:
Magnus…
ALB:
Yup, this is the real deal. Not only does it relieve pain, it improves your eyesight, adds body and shine to your hair, and it’s great for headaches too.
HOLL:
And it seems to be controlling what you say.
ALB:
Nonsense. How can an all-natural herbal potion have any effect on what I say?
MAGNU:
Yeah, Holly. Say, what’s the cure for rocket fleas?
ALB:
Rocket fleas? You might want to try this new product we’ve got. It’s called—
MAGNUS AND HOLLY AND ALB:
—Frinozipax.
ALB:
Ah, you’ve heard of it?
HOLL:
It’s all you’ve talked about since we opened this morning!
ALB:
Well, it does have a thousand uses.
HOLL:
Can I try a bottle?
ALB:
Absolutely. Here you go.
MAGNU:
Alba, I have a hangnail.
HOLL:
Magnus!
ALB:
A hangnail? Well, we have a new product just in that you might be—what am I saying?
HOLL:
See, you keep talking about this stuff!
ALB:
I hope this wears off.
HOLL:
That’s why I need to test it.
ALB:
Good idea. See if it’s a Moliari curse.
SOUND: Stopper pops
HOLL:
Okay.
(tastes it, smacks her lips)
ALB:
Holly!
HOLL:
Nope, not Moliari. Wow, I see why people like it, though! I feel pretty good!
MAGNU:
That’s how you test it?
HOLL:
It’s my protocol number one! What? I feel fine.
ALB:
That was incredibly stupid.
HOLL:
I only took a tiny sip!
MAGNU:
You know, I think I might have gout.
ALBA AND HOLL:
Gout, you say? Have you ever tried Frinozipax?
MAGNU:
Why, no, I haven’t.
ALB:
Magnus.
MAGNU:
It sounds amazing.
ALB:
Stop it.
MAGNU:
What else does it do?
ALBA AND HOLL:
Oh, it’s a wonder of modern medicine.
ALB:
Not only does it cure gout…
HOLL:
It erases wrinkles…
ALB:
Builds strong teeth…
HOLL:
And it’s great with pie!
MAGNU:
Golly gee! What’s it made from?
ALBA AND HOLL:
It’s an all-natural herbal formula…
HOLL:
…wow, that’s crazy!
ALB:
(nonstop)
…made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients. Magnus, if you do that one more time I will cuff you.
MAGNU:
Totally, totally worth it.

WITHROW (CONT’D)
Be right there!
SOUND: Trunk slammed hastily
SOUND: Door opens
WITHROW (CONT’D)
Alba! Back for more already?
ALB:
Why yes, you devil. And I could use another couple of cases of Frinozipax too.
WITHRO:
Can do. Take as much as you need.
ALB:
It’s been flying off the shelves. What a day! I could use a dose myself.
WITHRO:
Go right ahead.
SOUND: Bottle uncorked
ALB:
Thanks.
(drinks)
That’s odd. Does this taste funny to you?
WITHRO:
Funny?
ALB:
Here, have a sip.
WITHRO:
(drinks)
Seems fine to me.
ALB:
It isn’t expired, is it?
WITHRO:
Can’t be. I just bottled that batch.
ALB:
So you bottle it yourself?
WITHRO:
It’s a secret process. I can’t tell you much more than that.
ALB:
Of course you can tell me aaall about it.
WITHRO:
It comes out of a special keg I got from Mister Benvenito. Wait—why did I just say that?
ALB:
Say what?
WITHRO:
You swapped the bottle! That wasn’t Frinozipax you gave me!
ALB:
No. We altered the recipe a little. So, instead of selling more, it makes you tell the truth, Withrow.
WITHRO:
Alba! I wouldn’t lie to you.
ALB:
For instance, where might I find this magical keg?
WITHRO:
Why, it’s in my trunk. Hey! No! Alba!
ALB:
Get out of the way, Withrow.
WITHRO:
I… I have a headache!
ALB:
A headache? Have you tried Frinozipax? Nice try, you sleazy cad!
SOUND: Flurry of blows from a purse
WITHRO:
Ow! Ow! Alba, what’s Frinozipax?
ALB:
(furious)
Let me tell you all about Frinozipax! It’s an all-natural herbal potion made from oily sandflower and cheeseweed plus sixteen secret ingredients!
WITHRO:
Ow! Help! Alba, please! I bruise easily!
ALB:
Not only does it relieve bruising, it brings down swelling, heals up friction burns, and it’s great for black eyes too. Except that it doesn’t really do any of that, does it, Withrow?
WITHRO:
No. But it does relieve pain!
ALB:
For a little while—and then it fades. And every time you take it, it does less and less.
WITHRO:
At least it works quickly…
SOUND: Latches click, then trunk opens
ALB:
Quicker than the Streaking Cheetahs of Highspeedia. This little keg here? I’m guessing it’s enchanted to provide an endless supply—am I right?
WITHRO:
That’s right. Alba, don’t—Mister B will kill me if anything happens to it!
ALB:
Who is this Mister Benvenito?
WITHRO:
He invented Frinozipax. He’s from Qwaytox…
ALB:
A demon, then! I should have known. So this “conference” you’re in town for…
WITHRO:
I’ve been sworn to secrecy!
ALB:
I assume Mister Benvenito is running the show?
WITHRO:
Yes… please give me the keg.
ALB:
And where is the conference?
WITHRO:
At the Weird Fellows’ Lodge on Knife-Sharpeners’ Lane. Alba, I think I have the plague!
ALB:
The plague, you say?
SOUND: Big solid wooden smash and splatter
WITHRO:
Nooo! Alba!
ALB:
Sorry, Frinozipax won’t cure the plague. Withrow, it’s been fun, but I draw the line at prescribing snake oil to my patients. If I ever catch you pulling this sort of stunt again, I will have you chucked in a dungeon so fast it’ll give the Streaking Cheetahs vertigo.
WITHRO:
I’m a dead man, Alba! He really will kill me!
ALB:
You should have thought of that before you started working for a Qwaytoxian demon.
WITHRO:
He’ll send me to the… the Home Office… Alba, I like my skin. I want to keep it.
ALB:
You’d better help me out, then, hadn’t you?
WITHRO:
Yes, Alba.
INT. AUDITORIU:
COUNTES:
When I was diagnosed with marthambles, I couldn’t look my friends in the eye. But I talked to my doctor about Frinozipax and guess what? It worked, and today I have a full head of beautiful hair again. Thank you, Frinozipax.
WALLA: Wild cheering
BENVENIT:
There you have it, folks. There are thousands of stories like Countess Carnelia’s—thousands of ways that you are making a difference. So are you having a good time? Who’s having a good time? Yeah! Yeah!
ALB:
(off stage)
Look at them. These people are crazy!
WITHRO:
(off stage)
Keep your voice down! If anyone finds out I smuggled you in here…
ALB:
Your Mister Benvenito knows how to work a crowd.
BENVENIT:
Let’s talk a bit about our three-pronged approach to sales. First, of course, is our spreadable messaging—it’s more contagious than the pony pox.
WALLA: Laughter
BENVENITO (CONT’D)
Second: our fabulous incentive program, and we’ll be rewarding our amazing points leaders in just a few minutes. And thirdly, our Live and Learn program. We call it Teaching by Example. Could I have Vin Prang, Alicia Burgestu—I hope I’m pronouncing that right—and Clarence McMainley up on the stage? Come on down! Hey guys. Glad you could make it.
WALLA: Whispers
BENVENITO (CONT’D)
Now. These folks are unfortunately at the bottom of our points ranking this quarter. But that’s okay, because we’re going to make their experience into a learning opportunity for everyone.
(to the three)
Step right up on those marks, that’s right.
(to the audience)
These three are going to our Home Office in the hell dimension of Qwaytox for some hands on education, right now!
SOUND: Clunk and creak
SOUND: Roaring fire and screams of the damned
WALLA: Fear then horrified silence
WITHRO:
See! That could have been me!
ALB:
There’s still time. Now get out there.
BENVENIT:
Live and learn, folks. But now it’s time to award a very special vacation on the beautiful Meyurian Riviera to some very special and hard-working sales representatives—I’m talking, of course, about everyone in this room! Yeah! You! And you! And you! Everybody here gets a vacation!
WALLA: Cheering, even wilder than before
BENVENITO (CONT’D)
(to himself)
What a bunch of chumps. Where’s my drink?
WITHRO:
Here, Mister Benvenito.
BENVENIT:
(drinks, then spits)
What is this? I said wood alcohol! This is god damned Frinozipax!
WALLA: Sudden hush
WITHRO:
Sorry, sir! Wrong bottle.
BENVENIT:
What’s your name?
WITHRO:
W‑Withrow Lee.
BENVENIT:
Ah, yes, Withrow
How are ya? Enjoying the conference?
WITHRO:
Yes, sir!
SOUND: Paper being flourished
BENVENIT:
You remember this contract? Signing over your soul and all your earthly possessions to me? Remember the penalties for noncompliance?
WITHRO:
I didn’t really read that part…
ALB:
And this is why we don’t do deals with demons.
BENVENIT:
Say, folks, according to this, our good friend Withrow Lee has just earned an upgrade from re-education at the Home Office to eternal torment.
WITHRO:
Accende meum ignem!
SOUND: Crackling flame
WALLA: Gasps
BENVENIT:
Oh, now, Withrow
Did you really think that would work? Burning up one little piece of paper? When I have six more copies filed away in separate magic-proof vaults?
ALB:
No, but there’s still a loophole.
BENVENIT:
Who the blazes are you?
ALB:
An interested party. Mister Benvenito, isn’t it true that you and your company can be banished from this earthly plane by saying your name three times?
BENVENIT:
Of course it is. But it would have to be my true name. Why am I telling you this?
ALB:
Must be something in the water.
BENVENIT:
That drink… you tricked me. Lee!
WITHRO:
She made me do it!
ALB:
What’s your true name, demon?
BENVENIT:
My name… is Astraxo. Dammit!
ALB:
Thanks.
ALBA AND WITHRO:
Astraxo, diabolum! (dee-AB-o-lum) Astraxo, exeas! (ex-ZAY-ass) Astraxo effugare! (ef-foo-GA-ray)
SOUND: A giant clap of thunder
IM:
Hello, Kathmak Mystical Group. My name is Serdikos. You’re requesting the banishment of the demon Astraxo to his home realm of Qwaytox?
ALB:
That’s right…
IM:
No problem, ma’am, we can do that for you right now. I’ll just need you to answer three verification questions for me.
BENVENIT:
Aha!
ALB:
What?
IM:
It’s just standard policy. Question one: What school did Mister Astraxo attend?
ALB:
Astraxo? Tell us.
BENVENIT:
Well, I would, but I’m afraid I’ve gone and forgotten the answers!
WITHRO:
I don’t think he’s lying.
ALB:
You’ve forgotten what school you went to?
BENVENIT:
I expunged all those useless memories when I took over the family enterprise. I made room in my brain for strategy and logistics instead.
(scoffs)
Childhood. Such a pitiful, unproductive time.
ALB:
So what school? Braxonic College?
WITHRO:
A demon of his rank? Naw.
(to Benvenito)
Was it Creepside?
SOUND: Clang
IM:
Thank you.
BENVENIT:
Lucky guess.
IM:
Question two… What was Mister Astraxo’s favourite book growing up?
ALB:
How old are you?
BENVENIT:
Seventy-two. Arghh!
ALB:
That narrows it down a little.
WITHRO:
“Gertie the Goblin”? “The Sword in the Stove”?
BENVENIT:
I’m not saying! I can’t hear you!
ALB:
“The Littlest Unicorns”.
SOUND: Clang
BENVENIT:
That’s not true! I hate unicorns!
IM:
That’s the answer I have here. Finally… what was the name of your first pet growing up?
BENVENIT:
I didn’t have a pet. I ate every animal that came into my family’s cave!
IM:
Well, maybe so, but it says here you named at least one of them.
ALB:
Remember… was it a bunny? A kitty? A lightning lizard?
BENVENIT:
I can’t hear you, la la la!
(then, faraway)
Lizard…
ALB:
Aha! What did your lizard look like, Astraxo? What colour?
BENVENIT:
Red… he was red.
ALB:
Did he sleep on your bed at night?
BENVENIT:
He… he used to sleep in the coals in the fireplace, or if he wanted to cool off he’d sleep on my pillow. He was the best.
ALB:
And you called him…
BENVENIT:
B‑Bloodstone.
SOUND: Clang
IM:
Thank you for verifying… we’ll just go ahead with that banishment now. Have a great day and thank you for choosing Kathnak.
BENVENIT:
Wretched humans! You’ll be hearing from our lawyers!
SOUND: A noise like a huge drainpipe and a clap of thunder
WALLA: Shock, turning to anger
ALB:
Good riddance. Well, good news, everyone. You’re free now—no longer slaves to a cruel, avaricious demon.
(pause)
Er… don’t all thank me at once.
FIRST SALES RE:
That was our livelihood!
SECOND SALES RE:
And now you’ve voided our contracts.
WITHRO:
Uh oh.
THIRD SALES RE:
What about my free vacation?
WALLA: Outrage—cries of “yeah!” and a growing chorus of “kill! kill!”
WITHRO:
Alba!
ALB:
There’s just no pleasing some people.
WITHRO:
Ruuun!

That’s a pretty dress, Mummy.
PARABE:
Thank you, Willemina!
WILLEMIN:
Is it for the wedding?
PARABE:
Why, yes it is.
WILLEMIN:
Will Princess Minsey have a dress like that?
PARABE:
No, this one is nicer, because the queen has to have the best dress of all.
WILLEMIN:
I guess that’s fair.
PARABE:
Of course it is.
WILLEMIN:
Because Princess Minsey is prettiest.
PARABE:
What, darling?
WILLEMIN:
Daddy says Minsey will be riding a unicorn.
PARABE:
Does he.
WILLEMIN:
Did you have a unicorn at your wedding, Mummy?
PARABE:
No, just regular old horses.
WILLEMIN:
Oh. Was this before unicorns?
PARABE:
Before unicorns?
WILLEMIN:
You know. In old people times.

What’s that supposed to mean?

You’re the queen. ‘Cause you’re married and you’re old.

Who would have thought? Two warring nations finding peace at last through marriage—between two young people who actually love one another.

Who would have thought?
GUNTHE:
Goodness, look at them. It takes me right back to our wedding.

Our wedding wasn’t quite this big. And this is just the rehearsal.

Of course.

Alba? What are you doing?
ALB:
Just a bit of protective magic for your Majesties. Something bad is in the air.
PARABE:
Yes, I believe it’s that horrid incense you’ve been waving around.
ALB:
A huge international event like this is a perfect target for someone with their eye on your kingdom, and your heads.
GUNTHE:
Magical security is already being taken care of by Mister Krankel.
PARABE:
Doctor Krankel.
ALB:
I know. You might as well put the Poachers’ Guild in charge of the Royal Jackalope Sanctuary.
GUNTHE:
Nonsense.
PARABE:
The Sorceror General has always been—
ALB:
—always been a power-hungry, conniving rat. And since when are you a fan of his?
PARABE:
I just think he deserves a fair shake, that’s all.
ALB:
I’ll give him a fair shake.
GUNTHE:
Alba, let’s discuss this after the rehearsal.

All right. But mark my words—there is an evil force, lurking in the shadows to ruin the royal wedding.

INT. PALACE COURTYAR:
SOUND: Lively chatter
GUNTHE:
Looking forward to the wedding tomorrow, Your Magnificence?
ROCKHAR:
I hate these ceremonies, myself. I’ll just be glad to see my youngest married off, the damn fool.
GUNTHE:
Prince Bulwark seems like a fine lad. Sharp as a hedgehog’s backside.
ROCKHAR:
Always littering the place with his poetry and depressing us with his terrible songs. I blame the wife, you know. Coddled him terribly.
GUNTHE:
But luckily he’s found love at last.
ROCKHAR:
Yes, I suppose. Minsey’s a lovely girl, for a foreigner. I expect she’ll measure up.
GUNTHE:
“Measure up”?
ROCKHAR:
Perform, you know. Make a man of young Bully. He could use it.
GUNTHE:
I see.
ROCKHAR:
She’s a fine woman. Speaking of which, that Queen of yours—phwoar!
PARABE:
I beg your pardon?
ROCKHAR:
(to Gunther)
Ooo, look, she’s pretty when she’s angry. So prim and proper in public. But I’ll bet she’s a real tiger in the old royal bedchamber, what?
PARABE:
One happens to be standing right here, Your Magnificence.
ROCKHAR:
Too bad she hasn’t been able to give you any male heirs.
GUNTHE:
Well! We should be getting on. We’ll see you at dinner, then, Your Magnificence?
ROCKHAR:
Indeed.
(whispers, to Parabel)
Wear something low-cut, eh?
PARABE:
(gasps)
Well, I never! And you said nothing to defend me.
GUNTHE:
Dear, the man has a whole army at our doorstep. It’s best we don’t wag our fingers in the face of the hungry dog of fate.
MINSE:
Uncle Gunther! Aunt Parabel!
PARABE:
Oh no.
GUNTHE:
Minsey! How’s my favourite niece?
MINSE:
Oh, I’m in such a muddle! I didn’t mean to rush ahead at the altar, but I couldn’t help it!
PARABE:
Anything to get through it faster.
MINSE:
Did you see Bully’s face? When we got to the vows he did that little thing where his lips get squinched up…
GUNTHE:
I’m sure it was suitably adorable.
MINSE:
And tomorrow we get to do it all again for real!
PARABE:
Yes! Wonderful!
MINSE:
I’m afraid I might just explode!
(giggles)
PARABE:
Oh, please don’t do that…
GUNTHE:
Speaking of tomorrow—I brought you this.
MINSE:
A necklace? Oh, Uncle, it’s beautiful!
PARABE:
(sweetly)
Gunther, darling…
GUNTHE:
It was made for your grandmother Queen Ursula.
MINSE:
Oh, Uncle!
PARABE:
(whispering)
Sweetie bear, did you just give her my necklace?
MINSE:
I love it so much.
PARABE:
(whispering)
From our wedding?
GUNTHE:
(whispering)
You haven’t worn it since. I thought you didn’t like it.
PARABE:
(whispering)
What does that have to do with it?
MINSE:
Thank you, Uncle G!
GUNTHE:
You’re welcome, Minsey.
MINSE:
It’ll go so nicely with my dress! It was sewn by mice, you know. Mice! Isn’t it all just too perfect!
(giggles)
PARABE:
(laughs)
Yes. It’s just too perfect.

Wedding day! Wedding day!
MAGNU:
Black bile levels… twenty point three…
HOLL:
(singing)
It’s a perfect day to get married, especially if you’re a princess or a prince!
MAGNU:
Yellow bile, seventy-two point… Holly, do you really have to sing while you work?
HOLL:
Yes! We fairies have music in our very souls.
MAGNU:
And candy floss in your very brains.
HOLL:
Oh, Magnus, listen to you. It’s a bright, sunny day, and tomorrow, Princess Minsey will get married to the Prince of Balgomar, and you? You’re just the grumpiest thing on two legs.
MAGNU:
You’re right, Holly, it’s such a beautiful day to be stuck in the office at the House of Healing testing urine samples.
(sighs)
So what are you doing inside?
HOLL:
I’m brewing a cordial from the fruit of the rare Gesundephat tree.
MAGNU:
That’s what all that mess in the laboratory is for?
HOLL:
It’s a gift for the Prince and Princess!
MAGNU:
Alba’s gonna kill you.
HOLL:
It’s okay, it’s nearly finished.
SOUND: Exterior door
MAGNU:
Speak of the witch.
HOLL:
Hi, Alba!
ALB:
Holly, where were you this morning? I could have used some help with my protective spells for the Royal Family.
HOLL:
Oh my gosh, I completely forgot! I’m so sorry, Alba. How many good deeds do I owe you now?
ALB:
I lost count at forty. And for heaven’s sake, will someone clean up this damned office?
HOLL:
So was the rehearsal nice? I hear they’re going to have fountains that pour out chocolate, custard and strawberry jam!
SOUND: Interior door slams
HOLL:
Gosh. I hope she’s feeling all right.
MAGNU:
Duh. It’s the wedding.
HOLL:
But everyone loves weddings! There’s cake! And flowers! And cake!
MAGNU:
That’s just it. Remember? Her own lack of a happily-ever-after royal wedding?
HOLL:
Huh?
MAGNU:
Don’t you know how the King and Queen got married?
HOLL:
My memories from back then are a bit foggy.
MAGNU:
And you wonder why I don’t try your fairy drinks.
HOLL:
So, what about the King and Queen?
MAGNU:
Okay, once upon a time, when the King was still a prince, he got turned into a goat by an evil witch.
HOLL:
Really?
MAGNU:
People came from all over the kingdom to see if they could cure him. They tried magic, acupuncture, hot baths… nothing worked. And then three sisters came to the Palace.
HOLL:
Did they cure him?
MAGNU:
The oldest one cast a spell but it didn’t work. The middle sister brought a magic flower from a far-off mountain, but that didn’t work. Then the youngest one came over and kissed him… and he became human again.
HOLL:
Awwww! And that was Queen Parabel?
MAGNU:
Yup. They got married a week later. But the older sisters were jealous because they’d failed.
HOLL:
I guess they must have been. Poor Alba.
MAGNU:
Yeah, well, don’t mention it to her. She’s kind of touchy about it. Probably it was her last chance at scoring a husband or something.
SOUND: Interior door
ALB:
Holly, did you finish brewing that liniment for Mr. Woo?
HOLL:
Working on it! Alba, I’m so sorry about your wedding.
ALB:
My wedding?
HOLL:
Or, I mean… the fact you didn’t have a wedding because you didn’t cure the King that one time. Prince, I mean. Who’s now the King.
ALB:
Holly, I really do need that liniment.
HOLL:
It’s okay, Alba, I understand. It can be tough making up for your own mistakes. I should know!
ALB:
Never mind. I’ll make it myself.
HOLL:
All this wedding business must be such a painful reminder of past trauma that you can’t think clearly.
ALB:
Holly, I think you might want to leave the building while you still can.
HOLL:
But I have to filter my cordial!
ALB:
What cordial?
HOLL:
The one I’ve been making for the Prince and Princess!
ALB:
You mean the orange muck I just poured down the drain?
HOLL:
You just what?
ALB:
I threw it out.
HOLL:
But… but I’ve been infusing that for eleven days! Do you know how hard it was to find a ripe Gesundephat fruit at this time of year?
ALB:
I can’t make proper medicines when all the equipment in my laboratory is full of vile-smelling moonshine brewed by a brainless bumpkin fairy.
HOLL:
Alba! That’s… that’s the meanest thing anybody has ever said to anybody ever!
ALB:
There’s plenty more where it came from.
HOLL:
I thought you cared.
ALB:
Holly, if you don’t clear out this minute it’s going to be very bad for your health.
HOLL:
Well, I’m not sorry about your non-marriage. I hope all your days are filled with regret and loneliness. And no cake. Ever.

Boy, some people just have no tact.
INT. PALACE HAL:
GUNTHE:
More wine, Your Magnificence?
ROCKHAR:
Don’t mind if I do.
SOUND: Pouring
GUNTHE:
Er, I wonder if we might get on to resolving the territorial dispute over the Pointy Lands.
ROCKHAR:
Dispute?
GUNTHE:
Well, disagreement.
ROCKHAR:
Are you disagreeing with me?
GUNTHE:
Difference of opinion?
ROCKHAR:
What opinion? We propose to hand back the Pointy Lands to Farloria.
GUNTHE:
Really!
ROCKHAR:
In exchange for which Balgomar will retain the right to extract any minerals and mystical energies from the surrounding Loo Lines.
GUNTHE:
But the coast is unstable there. The chances of a mystical accident—
ROCKHAR:
Are two million percent. Or two million to one. Something with zeroes in it. Anyway, if it does blow up, in all likelihood the wind will carry all the residue southward.
GUNTHE:
Into Farlorian territory.
ROCKHAR:
Well, I daresay you lot are quite used to that sort of thing, what?
GUNTHE:
We’d also like to see Balgomarian troops pull back from the River Twist.
ROCKHAR:
We’d love to!
GUNTHE:
Oh!
ROCKHAR:
In an ideal world, of course we would. We’d withdraw them all in a heartbeat. But sadly, we live in a world of whatchemacallem, geopolitical instability, what. A king needs armies.
GUNTHE:
But do those armies have to be sitting on our border, Magnificence?
ROCKHAR:
They have to sit somewhere.
GUNTHE:
Surely you have other borders to defend?
ROCKHAR:
Yes, but those are with our enemies.
GUNTHE:
Not sure I get your meaning.
ROCKHAR:
It’ll make them wonder. “If those Balgomarians have an army like that poised to lay waste to Farloria at a moment’s notice,” they’ll say to themselves, “what terrible ruin could they wreak on us?”
GUNTHE:
Ah.
ROCKHAR:
They’ll think twice about invading once they see how well we fortify ourselves against friendly nations! And Gunther, my boy, I’d certainly call Balgomar and Farloria friendly nations, wouldn’t you?
GUNTHE:
Of course, Your Magnificence.
INT. OFFICE OF THE SORCEROR GENERA:

By the rose and by the fern / By the frond and by the thorn / To honey sweet this water turn / By the first light of the morn.
SOUND: Magic twinkling, turning warped and ugly
PARABE:
Oh dear. The roses are all going brown. Does that mean it’s working?
KRANKE:
Perhaps flower charms are not Your Majesty’s forte either.
PARABE:
I thought flowers might help me to relax.
KRANKE:
As I have said before, I suspect that Your Majesty’s natural predisposition is toward elemental magic.
PARABE:
Well, then, do teach me some, Doctor Krankel.
KRANKE:
Of course.
(thinks)
Ah. Your Majesty, observe the steam from this teacup.
SOUND: Tea poured, cup clinks
PARABE:
Yes.
KRANKE:
Concentrate on the patterns it makes as it moves.
PARABE:
It’s rising…
KRANKE:
Indeed. Watch the currents as it rises and… er… forms itself into a small black cloud. Good heavens.
SOUND: A tiny clap of thunder, a rising hiss—then a bang and a shower of tea and teacup bits
PARABE:
Oh!
KRANKE:
Dear me.
PARABE:
Was it supposed to do that?
KRANKE:
It may be safest to finish up Your Majesty’s lesson for the day.
PARABE:
I don’t know what happened.
KRANKE:
Nervous tension may be a factor. To do, perhaps, with the royal nuptials tomorrow?
PARABE:
No, everything is wonderful. Everyone thinks the Prince and Princess are the most beautiful couple that ever walked the aisle. And Gunther’s been kind enough to go through all my closets to save me the trouble of choosing gifts.
KRANKE:
Truly a grand day for our kingdom. To say nothing of its new “allies”.
PARABE:
Ohhh! Those Balgomarians have no respect at all. The things they say about me! I’m Queen, for heaven’s sake.
KRANKE:
But a Queen, if Your Majesty will forgive me, who was born a commoner. The Balgomarians have little respect for any ruler not descended from a royal bloodline.
PARABE:
The filthy brigands.
KRANKE:
Which is a worrying thought. If the Balgomarians were to “consolidate their influence” here in Farloria, they might decide our kingdom would be better ruled by Prince Bulwark and his new bride.
PARABE:
Rule Farloria? Those little twerps?
KRANKE:
I fear so. And there would go Your Present Majesties’ heads.
PARABE:
You really think they would kill us?
KRANKE:
They did it to Lord Ponsling and the Duke of Norwexony.
PARABE:
Something must be done.
KRANKE:
As you say, Majesty. But where to begin?
PARABE:
Well, between you and me, Doctor Krankel… I’m a little concerned about Princess Minsey’s ears.
KRANKE:
Come again?
PARABE:
Some feel they’re too big.
KRANKE:
Surely that’s up to the groom to decide?
PARABE:
That’s what I said. But after the rehearsal I’m sure I heard some of the Balgomarian royals chatting, and they were making the most unfortunate comments. Large ears are considered bad luck, apparently. Something about demonic rabbits.
KRANKE:
Ah. Well, when one marries one’s niece to a foreign prince, one has to put up with foreign folk beliefs.
PARABE:
So. Do you think there’s anything we can do for poor dear Princess Minsey?
KRANKE:
Did Your Majesty have anything in particular in mind?
INT. PALACE CHAMBER:
ALB:
Dead? The Princess is dead?
PARABE:
I’m afraid so. Such a terrible thing. Her lady in waiting found her this morning.
ALB:
Parabel, I’m so sorry. Gunther must be devastated.
PARABE:
It was so sudden. I can’t understand it.
KRANKEL.
(arriving)
I can. This was lying beside the young lady’s bed. An empty bottle of extract of croakweed—a deadly poison.
PARABE:
Poison! Well, so much for all your protective spells, then.
ALB:
She must have taken it herself.
PARABE:
Suicide?
ALB:
No, it would have to have been by mistake. The magic would have kept anyone from poisoning Minsey deliberately, herself included. But where could she have gotten croakweed?
PARABE:
Yes, where?
KRANKE:
Well, if you’ll look closely, the bottle’s label bears the seal of the House of Healing.
ALB:
What?
PARABE:
Alba! You don’t mean to say that you had something to do with it?
ALB:
How could I have?
PARABE:
You poisoned the Princess!
ALB:
Parabel, why would I do a thing like that?
PARABE:
You never liked poor Minsey.
ALB:
Whereas you loved her more than life itself.
PARABE:
Perhaps her wedding was too much of a reminder of how you lost the chance to marry your own prince?
ALB:
That was nine years ago, Parabel. I think I’m quite over it, thank you.
KRANKE:
The question remains: how did the Princess happen to obtain a bottle of deadly poison from the House of Healing?
PARABE:
Yes, how?
ALB:
Oh no.
INT. CHAPE:
MAGNU:
I didn’t know! Honest! She came in dressed like a farm girl. I didn’t know who she was.
GUNTHE:
And you gave her the croakweed?
MAGNU:
How was I supposed to know it was poison?
ALB:
Did you happen to notice the great big skull on the side of the bottle?
MAGNU:
I was too busy trying to read Holly’s handwriting.
ROCKHAR:
The Kingdom of Balgomar demands that this witch and her ridiculous assistant be punished for this injury to our people!
MAGNU:
Hey, now…
GUNTHE:
Injury to your people?
ROCKHAR:
The death of my son’s bride-to-be! We demand that these two be not only hanged, but preferably drawn and quartered, and possibly roasted first!
GUNTHE:
This witch happens to be Royal Physician and sister to the Queen.
ROCKHAR:
It matters not.
ALB:
Your Majesty, I’m sure there’s an explanation for this. I need to examine the Princess.
ROCKHAR:
In order to work some foul magic on the body, I’ll wager!
GUNTHE:
The Royal Physician may examine the Princess.
MAGNU:
And her assistant?
ROCKHAR:
Silence!
ALB:
Wait. There’s a pulse.
GUNTHE:
You mean she’s…
ALB:
It’s very, very slow and faint, but there’s a pulse.
GUNTHE:
But she’s cold as ice! And when we held a mirror to her face, there wasn’t breath enough to make it fog up.
ALB:
Well, I have good news, Your Majesty. Princess Minsey is alive.
GUNTHE:
Thank heavens!
ALB:
But she is in a deep, deep sleep. Hmm. Her pupils are dilated, and there’s… a silver star in each of her eyes.
ROCKHAR:
Meaning what?
ALB:
Meaning… she didn’t take croakweed after all. It was cloakweed! Magnus, you idiot, you’ve saved the day.
MAGNU:
Just doing my job.
GUNTHE:
How long will she sleep for?
ALB:
If she drank an entire bottle at my usual strength… a hundred years.
GUNTHE:
A hundred! Is there a cure?
SOUND: Door creaks open
BULWAR:
(a dramatic groan)
Ohhh…
GUNTHE:
Your Highness!
ROCKHAR:
Bulwark! What are you doing here, boy?
BULWAR:
Oh, Minsey my love.
GUNTHE:
We have good news and bad news, Your Highness.
BULWAR:
So beautiful even under this shroud of gloomy night eternal. Perchance might a kiss break the spell and restore to you your precious life?
(kisses her)
ALB:
Your Highness, please don’t disturb the patient.
BULWAR:
Nothing! Oh Minsey, why must it end like this?
ROCKHAR:
Bulwark! Pull yourself together.
GUNTHE:
The Princess still lives.
BULWAR:
Indeed! Her soul resides now in heaven above, as doth her spirit in my heart.
ALB:
No, literally, Your Highness, she’s still—
BULWAR:
But if our love cannot in this life, than mayhap in the next.
SOUND: Sword drawn
GUNTHE:
Your Highness!
ROCKHAR:
Stop it, boy! What’s gotten into you?
BULWAR:
Farewell, O cruel world that might make… O cruel world that… oh, hang it all. A failure to the end, I die.
(stabs himself)
Aghh!
ROCKHAR:
Bulwark!
BULWAR:
I die… I die, Minsey. Oh, drat and fizzle, that hurt.
SOUND: A thump; his sword clatters to the ground
ROCKHAR:
You imbecile! She’s alive.
BULWAR:
A‑alive?
ROCKHAR:
I should simply let you expire and lay waste to this puny so-called kingdom.
GUNTHE:
No need for that!
BULWAR:
Father, please, no!
ROCKHAR:
(sighs)
But I grow soft-headed in my old age. You! Physician!
ALB:
Yes, Your Magnificence.
ROCKHAR:
How are you at healing foolish boys who have run themselves through with swords?
ALB:
It’s quickly becoming my specialty.
MAGNU:
Heh.
EXT. FOREST, NIGH:
SOUND: Crickets
HOLL:
…I just couldn’t believe she threw it away. After all my work! You think you know a person, and then you find out you were actually thinking about a different person. A person who’s mean and spiteful and gives other witches a bad name. I’m sorry to burden you with all this, Mister Moth. You’re such a good listener.
ALB:
(approaching)
Holly?
HOLL:
(wary)
Alba. What are you doing here?
ALB:
I need your help.
HOLL:
What’s that? You need a bumpkin fairy to stand around while you insult her and destroy her work?
ALB:
I’m sorry, Holly. I shouldn’t have done that. Even if you were getting on my nerves.
HOLL:
See, I can’t do anything right.
ALB:
Now stop it.
HOLL:
I’m a bad fairy. And you… you are an evil witch.
ALB:
Holly, you’ve been working at the House of Healing for how many months now?
HOLL:
Three. No. Eleven. No. Do you mean human months?
ALB:
We’ve saved lives, Holly. We’ve helped a poor prince turn back into a frog. We’ve cured people of the shrieking cough and the flattened fifths. Do you call that evil?
HOLL:
You lied to Jerome. You said he couldn’t talk for a week or he’d die.
ALB:
I may have exaggerated a little.
HOLL:
And you hit those two little kids and turned them purple.
ALB:
They tried to stick me in the oven, Holly.
HOLL:
Because they were scared of you! And what about that constipation remedy you gave to the Lord Mayor?
ALB:
All right, all right. But does any of that outweigh the good I’ve done? The good we’ve done for the people of this kingdom?
HOLL:
(considers)
No. But you went and threw out the cordial I’d been brewing for a week and a half.
ALB:
I know. I’m sorry.
HOLL:
Now I have nothing to give the Prince and Princess!
ALB:
Nonsense. Holly, you’re a fairy.
HOLL:
What does that have to do with—
ALB:
And they’re a young, soon-to-be-married couple.
HOLL:
So?
ALB:
Who might be on the way to having children soon. Children who might need a little help from a fairy as they grow up?
HOLL:
You mean—you mean help from me?
ALB:
You’re getting the idea.
HOLL:
You think I could be a fairy godmother?
ALB:
Why not?
HOLL:
Watch over their children? Impart wisdom? Make them beautiful clothes for the ball?
ALB:
The word of a fairy would be a gift more precious than any potion.
HOLL:
You’re right! Oh my gosh, you’re so right. Thank you, Alba! I can’t wait to tell the Prince and Princess!
ALB:
That’s where I need your help. Something’s happened to Minsey.
HOLL:
Oh no! What?
ALB:
She’s taken cloakweed and now she’s in a deep, deep sleep. We have to work a spell to wake her.
HOLL:
Okay. What do we need?
INT. CHAPE:
SOUND: Cauldron bubbling
ALB:
One coffee bean.
MAGNU:
One coffee bean.
SOUND: A small plop, and stirring
ALB:
A feather from the early bird.
HOLL:
One feather.
ALB:
The first rays of dawn captured in amber.
HOLL:
Check.
SOUND: A little glow
ALB:
One drop of the Princess’s blood.
MAGNU:
Coming up.
SOUND: Sword unsheathed—shing!
ALB:
One drop.
MAGNU:
We might need extra.
(sighs)
Okay, one drop.
SOUND: Sword sheathed
SOUND: Needles rattle
ALB:
The crow of a rooster.
HOLL:
Got it.
SOUND: A small bottle uncorked
SOUND: Rooster crow, thin and wavering
MAGNU:
Here. One drop of blood.
ALB:
Smelling salts from the Stinking Sea of Stank.
HOLL:
(holding her nose)
Right here.
ALB:
And finally, a whisker from a cat who has trodden on someone’s privates every morning for twenty years.
MAGNU:
Yup. Good old Mittens.
SOUND: Stirring, percolating
HOLL:
Almost ready, Alba.
ALB:
Surgamus et eamus. (SUR-ga-mus et AY-a-mus)
SOUND: Puff of steam and magic flourish, a bell in reverse
HOLL:
(wheezing)
Wow, it’s… certainly powerful.
ALB:
That would be the smelling salts.
MAGNU:
Ugh. If this doesn’t wake her up, nothing will.
ALB:
Hold her mouth open for me.
MAGNU:
Yup.
SOUND: Pouring. more magic
MINSE:
(sleepy, delicate coughing)
Oh my. Oh dear. Oh, yucky! What’s that?
ALB:
Your Highness. Don’t try to sit up yet.
MINSE:
Oh goodness. Where am I?
BULWAR:
Is it true? It is!
MINSE:
My prince!
BULWAR:
I was afraid I’d lost you forever.
MINSE:
Darling, your tunic is all bloodied! Have you been hurt?
BULWAR:
They said you were dead, my love. I simply couldn’t go on without you.
MINSE:
(breathless)
You mean, you tried to kill yourself? Because of me?
BULWAR:
Yes!
MINSE:
Well, that was a bit silly. What if I were still alive?
BULWAR:
And you are, love!
MINSE:
Well, then, it was very silly of you!
BULWAR:
I am a silly, aren’t I?
MINSE:
You are such a silly.
BULWAR:
But I’m your silly.
MINSE:
My big, silly, silly Prince Bully.
(they both giggle)
BULWAR:
Oh, Minsey, you do have the dearest smile. My only sorrow is that I cannot see it and kiss you at the same time.
MINSE:
You could paint a picture?
BULWAR:
That would be silly.
MINSE:
Yes!
(giggles)
HOLL:
It’s the cutest thing ever. The cutest thing ever!
MAGNU:
Pardon me while I go find a bucket to be sick in.
ALB:
Bring two.
INT. PALACE COURTYAR:
GUNTHE:
Are we all set? Is everyone alive and accounted for?
MINSE:
Here, Uncle Gunther!
ALB:
The bride is in perfect health, and the groom is healing up quite nicely. And I have my team on hand in case of any emergencies.
KRANKEL.
(entering grandly)
Your Majesty.
GUNTHE:
Yes, Mister Krankel?
KRANKE:
Doctor Krankel. My analysis of the residue confirms that it was indeed cloakweed, not croakweed. The mislabeling of the bottle certainly paints the House of Healing in a poor light.
ALB:
My assistant’s handwriting aside, we still don’t know why Princess Minsey took the croakweed in the first place.
GUNTHE:
That’s true. Minsey dear, why did you go looking for croakweed?
MINSE:
Oh, that! It was…
(whispers, embarrassed)
It was for my ears. Big ears are bad luck in Balgomar, you know.
KRANKE:
A ridiculous superstition.
GUNTHE:
Who told you that? Prince Bulwark?
MINSE:
No, he wouldn’t! It was Auntie Parabel.
GUNTHE:
Parabel?!
PARABE:
(arriving)
Yes, darling?
GUNTHE:
Minsey says you told her to take croakweed.
MINSE:
She said it was the only thing that would help.
PARABE:
(taken off guard)
Well! Yes! It was her ears, you know. I heard Prince Bully’s family whispering about them behind her back.
GUNTHE:
Her ears?
MINSE:
In Balgomarian they’re called “the horns of the demon rabbit”.
PARABE:
And I was told that croakweed would shrink them.
ALB:
Told by whom?
PARABE:
(beat)
It was Krankel. He specifically told me to recommend it.
KRANKE:
I—!
GUNTHE:
Krankel! Explain yourself.
KRANKE:
Your Majesty! I said no such thing!
GUNTHE:
Please tell me you didn’t suggest that my niece, the Princess of Mediocria, take a deadly poison to shrink her ears.
KRANKE:
Majesty! I did nothing to harm the Princess! It was the Queen! The jealous, fickle Queen!
GUNTHE:
What?
PARABE:
Don’t listen to him. He tried to kill Minsey! Alba was right—he is out to take over the kingdom.
GUNTHE:
Really.
PARABE:
Gunther, you can’t possibly believe that I wanted to kill your darling niece.
GUNTHE:
Of course not.
PARABE:
Guards, seize that man!
SOUND: Boots step forward, swords drawn
GUNTHE:
Well, Krankel, what do you have to say?
KRANKE:
Your Majesty, I protest! Clearly this is a case of—oh my, look over there!
GUNTHER and GUARD. What?
KRANKE:
Apodidraskein! (ah-po-dee-DRASS-kane)
SOUND: Big magical zap! then silence
PARABE:
He’s gone! Escaped!
GUNTHE:
Guards! Search the Palace. And the Office of the Sorceror General.
ALB:
I doubt you’ll find anything.
GUNTHE:
Where’s he gone, then?
ALB:
I don’t know. But I’m certain we haven’t seen the last of Helbard Krankel.
INT. HOUSE OF HEALIN:
HOLL:
Morning, Alba!
ALB:
(hums to herself)
Good morning, Holly. Good morning, Magnus.
MAGNU:
Gee, you’re… chipper. Are you feeling all right?
ALB:
Never better.
HOLL:
See, Magnus? A royal wedding lifts everyone’s spirits.
ALB:
As does the chance to say “I told you so” to the King and Queen.
MAGNU:
Aren’t you worried, though? Krankel is on the loose somewhere, probably with a big fat grudge.
ALB:
Oh, yes. But if I know him at all, he’ll be biding his time before he makes a move. And when he does, I’ll be ready.
MAGNU:
Maybe you should be teaching me some magic, in case he comes back and I need to defend myself.
ALB:
I’ve told you, I’ll teach you some magic as soon as you’re done getting our patient records back in order from that explosion.
MAGNU:
Have you looked at our patient records lately?
ALB:
Yes, what about them?
MAGNU:
You didn’t notice anything different?
SOUND: Wooden drawer slides open; riffling through papers
ALB:
Well, I thought it seemed a bit easier finding everything…
MAGNU:
Right?
ALB:
When did you get all this done?
MAGNU:
Oh, in between my seven hundred other chores. So how about it? A little magic training for your hard-working apprentice?
HOLL:
Uh, Alba…
ALB:
All right. I suppose you’ve earned a lesson or two.
MAGNU:
Yeaaah.
ALB:
Go find a bottle of fireweed oil and a box of thumbtacks and meet me in the library.
MAGNU:
(leaving)
You got it, boss.
SOUND: Paper rustle
HOLL:
Alba, these aren’t really in alphabetical order… and these patient names are gibberish.
ALB:
I know. It looks like Magnus enchanted my pen and had it relabel everything.
HOLL:
But you’re really going to teach him magic?
ALB:
No. I’m going to teach him a lesson. Or two.
