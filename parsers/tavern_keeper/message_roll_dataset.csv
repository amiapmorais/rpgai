Nature,"OOC: Just having my early morning breakfast coffee now, so ctaching up with things. :) I think a pleasure roll in the context you've used it (i.e. slave use of a white silk girl) would work as an opposed dice roll between relevant atributes/skills, rather than against a target number. My understanding is a target number applies when you're trying to achieve a result against an abstract something. i.e. trying to scale a wall, you roll vs an appropriate difficulty number, as the wall is an abstract something without stats, as opposed to a player character. Where you have an 'opposed action' against a player character, you both roll suitable attributes/skills. So in this case it would be your Pleasure skill versus Yasmin's Will. Her base Will would have a penalty applied because she has failed her slave belly test just earlier, which makes it easier for you. As a rule of thumb I'd use the table of successes on page 67 in respect of the fail of my slave belly roll previously to determine the level of the difficulty factor applied from page 66, on a like for like basis. i.e. the first 'solid success' of 1-4 points fail difference on the table would equate to the first category of +5 difficulty on the other table and so on.  Yasmin failed her slave belly test by 2 points and so that would fall in the 1-4 solid 'fail' which presents her now with a +5 difficulty factor to her resistance to your Pleasure roll. Hope that makes sense? I suspect with that sort of penalty the overall result will be the same as when you rolled against a base difficulty number.  So, you have a Pleasure skill of 16 which is enhanced by the difficulty of +5 because Yasmin is already aroused by what you did earlier, giving you a score of 21. Yasmin rolls her 4D6+2 Will to try and control herself. Which I'll roll now. :)The only other thing to mention is it's probably best to make things like 'Pleasure' rolls before writing a post, just in case for example you wrote a long post describing a success only to then roll a failure... ;) It's perfectly permissable to roll for both of us to speed things up and get an immediate result of course.  So let's see how our 'frigid' heroine withstands those hands on her sex...

If the smoke marks the village then is he going off to one side yet? Those Woodmen we just met seemed to say that half the village might be on his side and the others were against him. Perhaps Rathfic was important? We had better be VERY careful to find out what people think of Rathfic or of Oderic before say much. Being on a task for Beorn is our best defence in any debate."" ""What do you think about Oderic's aims?  Obviously, he cannot move too far over to the right as he would have to find a boat, or start swimming; so I guess he's either aiming to walk straight in, or slip around the edge. He certainly isn't avoiding the place!It has just occurred to me that if he's waiting around till dark, then he is hiding somewhere, and  we could walk past him if we are not more careful - we'd better check the trees as we go in.

Persuasion,"Zaken will take his cue now. ""Well my noble Lord, let me continue now that my dwarven colleague has mentioned me. I was visiting Dale when I came across our mutual Beorning friend and another of his associates in the hub of Dale: the Missing Scale. Actually, I was looking for a trade opportunity - my constant source of pleasure in this world I may say - and I had been put on the trail of this elf from Mirkwood by a trading associate from Dorwinion. She had become aware of the elf's interest in the same clothing woman that alluded to: in fact he had rescued her from that fire. Somehow he was incensed to find the perpetrators. I … got involved. Frankly, I was looking for a commission into the Elven Kingdom; he seemed a possible start. So far I have made no loss, but alas, no great progress either. If I remember rightly, that elf is searching out some sort of mining plan for the Elven King. But he is too tight lipped. I am beginning to despair of him being any use in developing trade.

(Gunvar will be waiting, forgetting to breathe, for his answer)""V e r y     I n t e r e s t i n g  words,  my lord. And yet, you now pause for my comment. How can you ask for my opinion unless you will deliver some more of the details? What exactly is it that you propose?  You say this is 'no less than a chance' - you excite me with the word chance: it means RISK and it means GAIN. I am no stranger to either, nor am I afraid of either. I relish both, for the rewards that can be gained, or for the experience alone. Pray continue, intrigue me some more with your mission. What can we do? what are we about to be asked to agree to? I think I see a reward in the near future. Would I be correct that you are offering my family, and Brorr's family, the permissions and the freedom to operate our great enterprise?If so, I know you will want something in return: we are both canny business folk - tell me what I have to stake and be exact about what I, er I mean we,  might win.""

But use 1 hope + 8 favoured when in the dusk due to cultural blessing if needed to make the roll certain. ",Stealth
Persuasion,"Considers Gunvar for a moment, ""I see, my lord, you test us a little more. Good. I am not offended. It is pleasing to see that you look for assurances of our abilities. Perhaps I can demonstrate my skills of deduction and analysis?   I would ask you to consider a small puzzle I solved when I travelled in the East. Indulge me, when I say that it is an old tale of an Eastern King who executed nine prisoners. The king started by tying them to posts set out in a square pattern in his courtyard -  a grid of 3 rows of 3 men in a line. Then the king rode his horse past them and cut off each head as he charged down in a single straight line. It started a bit like this, ""  sketched a grid to show how the nine condemned men were 'posted'. and then he continued,"" of course it would not be  a puzzle without a twist. Bring in your most capable servant, that weaselly fellow who met us at the gate might do. Is he clever enough to solve my puzzle do you think?""(OOC: I am going to assume that Gunvar is intrigued enough to permit this)""Now, if you remember,  the king charged along in a straight line, beheading all the men on his first run. So he may have made this trail first..."". ""After the first run, he had to twist his horse around to face a new way and he started his second charge, beheading prisoners in the new line of charging."""" and he continued until all were beheaded. Tired with his robust sense of justice, he looked at the courtyard and counted the number of times he had turned and charged. He saw he had turned four times and made five charge-lines in the sand. Let us see if you employ a fool my , this bit is easy, can your lackey draw out the 5 straight lines with the places the king turned his horse around as he executed the nine men?""(The lackey should have no problem doing this.)"" and now my puzzle, the king asked his court if he could do the same job with less turns and charges - is it possible?"" 's aim here is to amuse , and to show him that is a brighter associate than his best lackey. ",Courtesy
Persuasion,"""Ah, , once again you show your careful mind, with its intricate attention to detail and its ability to puzzle things through.You may need further convincing of our ambitions. I am not sure you have seen the extent of our plans. You ask for evidence of greatness, we seek great people to join us. You are clearly a strong and wise member of King Bard's council. You are versed deep in the intrigues of this region. This alone would be enough to recommend you to us an important - nay, vital, - ally. We have no foothold in the city except a sound financial and commercial set up.To demonstrate my trust in your standing and capability, you should know that we have already secured many of the stepping stones of our what we refer to as the Great Enterprise. Know this, Lord, when I reveal this you will become a confidant of the highest order. When the dragon fell on Esgaroth, we received a setback: we had almost 'owned' that weak fool, the Master at that time. Another year or two and we would have had him snared in debt and under our complete control. We have 'interests' in Dorwinion and beyond in Rhun; When recounted his story of the eastern king, he is speaking of a real king in a real court: one who is allied to our vision, as you might be - of course, he is a king - Bard is too intransigent to acquire. But I am convinced that you have the ability to influence him. It is why we wish to ally ourselves with you.But there is more!  From the East to Dale is not even half of our ambition. Are you prepared for GREAT risk and GREAT reward? "" (courtesy here to maintain Gunvar's attention & interest) ",Courtesy
Persuasion,"Continues, "" Moving from Dale to the west, we have two routes. First, Do you really believe that our elf is in Mirkwood by accident? Here we are  trying to get a very bold operation. If successful, we will have a way through that forest, guarded and guided by the blessings of the Elf King. We will secure his non-interference in the affairs of Dale and Esgaroth with riches that he has a weakness for. Of course this is not a finished project, it would be helpful if we had access to the wealth of Erebor's gem operations. The Elf king will need a particular sort of bribe. We know you have dwarf connections - how serious might they be? If you think I am being unguarded in comments, it is simply because now is the time for hard and clear talking and decisions. You are right to be cautious: but honesty with each other is paramount now. Perhaps you can feel more confident to trust us since you can see our ambitions?The second part? I spoke of two routes past the forest. We are already operating across the Narrows. travelled that way only last year. The carvings we delivered reveal that. But it is a longer route, and the forest would be better and more secret. Either way we will move ahead.Past the forest, we are based in the land of the Beornings. A man of your obvious good taste will not likely have travelled THERE!. They are simpletons, we control their foodstuffs and wool trade. Their menfolk make impressive bodyguards - loyal to the end and as easy to shape as the oaks they live amongst. I would be hiding the truth if I said we had safe passage across mountains. That is a further problem to solve.But after that we travel further through empty lands, small simple towns and rustic folks - to the Great Sea. Can you imagine it my Lord. An empire of trade and wealth from there, through here and on into the East.  this is our Great Enterprise. Commercial control of all of the North... and without the silly costs of armies, or the wastages of war. With this wealth we will control it all. What say you now? Are our ambitions worthy of consideration?"" (OOC: another very poor roll! To make this work, I would employ his Trading Trait/Speciality to convince Gunvar of the financial viability of the proposal and ask for a further automatic success) ",Persuade

He curses inside slightly. Only a few moments before he had made a small noise and some animal had moved in the bushes over to his right. (that's the unsuccessful Stealth roll) If the enemy had been alert, they would have identified the direction of the noise. As it was had countered the noise with the old hunting favourite of scaring a bird in a different tree and a different direction to confuse the prey animal. He had also dived into the brush. His bow was strung. Patient as an eagle, he waited to see if he had attracted anything or anyone.

The one who was walking ahead was younger and  handsome, an empty scabbard was hanging on his belt. The second was completely different:  his face was rough with many scars, he had a battered nose and strange sneer was stamped on his face, revealing a file of tainted and broken teeth. His dirty hands were clasping the shaft of a rusty spear. sighed and walked ahead to the strange couple. “Better do it, than to live with the fear of it” He said to himself, then he raised his right hand and said, speaking aloud to the two men:“Hail, my good men! Lucky to meet you in this wood, could you help me? I’m coming from Stonyford and I’m not familiar with this land…”His axe on his back and his bare hands in full view, he watched the two men getting close, trying to catch any sign of danger.

Glad to share my talents with Valter and you all!”Said smiling at the man and getting close to , then he patted the lad on the back saying:“Why the long face, my lad? Do you know whom I’m talking about, maybe?  Maybe you know that or the fair Brunhild, do you?”While he was talking to him he had turned his back on the thug, and when the young man raised his head cocked his eyes on him.Then he quickly turned to the other patting him on his back and hugging him with his left arm and exclaimed merrily:“So, be glad, both of you, because this evening you are going to listen the best skald of the Anduin’s Vales. Songs of love and valour, of dark treacheries and epic battles of beautiful ladies and mighty warriors!!”Then looking at the thug and bowing slightly his head he added with deference:“Mighty warriors as you surely are, my friend, aren’t you? But please, lead the way to your camp, I can’t wait to see that famous Valter and meet your friend .”Then, once they started walking along the path to the camp, began to whistle a tune, the agreed signal for his companions’ intervention. Few moments after he began to sing aloud so as to mask his companions’ approach and to distract the bandit’s attention. ",Song

There is a  slight movement from the guard; and prods the man's face - leaving a strong graze right across his right cheek. moves the point lower, because he is standing slightly behind the guard it runs across his shoulder and under the armpit: ""if you start to lift that sword out of your scabbard, my friend, I will run this through here and up under your ear. Have you ever seen how sheep are slaughtered in the Dalelands? Think about it.. think about your face as this spear point comes out from behind your eyes.. no one will remember your face without shuddering as they throw you in the pit."" is using his skills of persuasion to terrorise the guard. His low tense words are delivered with a almost venomous seething hatred. Slavers. Scum. Even the most obtuse of beings would realise that this is a man poised for the slightest excuse to run them through. It is likely that the other members of his party are almost as equally surprised.  ",Persuade
Persuasion,"Larsi having checked the field previous (Battle check), stepped forward, hand on sword, but it remained sheathed.""I would listen to the man."" Larsi said dismissively to the guard.

A bit of a bonus, )The guard reacts by placing his hands onto his head - clearly he has seen this sort of thing before. 's Insight tells him that this submissive position, although genuine, is only a temporary show. The man's mind is racing; he is trying to figure a way to turn the tables or get the initiative back. will prod him in the back again, with his spear point, ""you don't look very happy my friend. Well, this is to remind you I am going to keep you unhappy. It will make me happy to keep you unhappy. Get it? I'm looking for any twitch so I can run you through. Don't wake up in the night while I am on watch.... I will mistake it as trying to escape. And if there is any doubt, my friend, I will enjoy it.""(Ooc: hopefully no one will ask me to roll persuade on top of this: I would hope that this speech will make the guard decide to stay quiet after all. will add a persuade roll but only if L'M requires it)  ",Persuade
Insight,"Albeit reluctantly, looks at the pleading eyes of the youth they have been hunting. He did not speak with Brunhild, though he observed 's chat. The boy is not that much younger than he is. He had lost his actual parents and is now isolated from their replacements. It is to be understood how the boy might consider a 'guard ' as a protector rather than a jailor. eases his grip on his spear a little, without relaxing his concentration. His rage is no longer escalating. He sees Larsi pull out a piece of rope from his pack, and slightly nods approval. Rolls to determine the guard's manner and intentions. It seems the guard has no obvious intention to try anything from his seriously hindered position. ",Insight
Intimidation,"“Well, my lad, If I’ve to speak the truth… She’s not well. Not well at all.”Answered , with a serious voice and looking hard at the boy.Then he continued once the other had dropped his eyes.“If it’s true what they say, you stipped her of husband, love and brother at the same time. People look another way when they meet her on the road and she’s ashamed of herself so much so that she doesn’t dare to speak to anyone. She’s a stranger in her home.” paused seeing ’s eyes glistening with tears. “But look! It isn’t any good to cry over spilt milk! You, and only you can redeem her name and honour, and you know that the way to do it doesn’t go West, but North and across the Anduin! Now is the time to show what you’re really made of. Now is the time of the courage of a hard choice. Go to Beorn, my lad, and face your judgment head-on. Be a man! Chance is there that you won’t pay your mistake with your life. Hope is there that you can meet Brunhild again afterward.”He stopped talking for a moment, then, setting his big hand on the boy’s shoulder, he added:“So then? What’s the measure of your love for her? What’s your choice?” ",Awe
Persuasion,"""Aye, lad, many actions can have unintended consequences. It is much better for one to own his actions, for good and ill, than to flee cravenly."" Larsi said, patting the boy on the shoulder.""Beorn is a fair judge, and will listen to your words. I wish no harm to befall you, simply that you see to right your wrongs."" ",Persuade

Persuasion,"""Well, I think that we will have very little time now, before these two are missed. That returning patrol might have been too useless to pick us up: but they are almost certain to be asked if they have seen our pair. Then the hunt will be up. , you said that Valter wants your help. To do what?  How important a pawn are you to his plans? Has he promised you anything once he is King? And do you really believe him - a slaver king? Who is 'King Valter' going to rule? Are there any people around here to rule? Where will he find the new slaves he needs? And is that the sort of life you want to share in? Would Brunhild want that life?"" (pauses, for enough time for that idea to be considered, and continues in a lower voice),"" or has Valter already got plans to buy her? and will he then sell her to you? Remember, to a slaver, everyone is nothing more than a bag of coins. Have you got enough to buy your own life back from Valter?""""Jot, , do you know of any happy slaves?"""" Larsi, you have travelled a lot: what say you? How does 'Slave- King Valter' sound? Will he be noble and honest? Fair? Are women and children safe in his hands? What happens to the old slaves when they get weak and frail? What would happen to an orphaned child? What might they be worth?"" The last comment should resonate with , shouldn't it? feels the urgency of the situation and wants to see if there is enough decency in the boy to see the true picture. (will try Persaude, but others might have to win the argument for him I suspect. Obviously add hope +7 to make the roll if needed.  ",Persuade
Persuasion,"""No, I know of places that use slaves, they are not good places, but we must be away, lest the hunters become the prey!"" Larsi says as he gestures for the boy to follow.""I will keep you safe from them, if you come with us."" Larsi rests his hand on his sword, looking around. ""Valter will see you under his rule with no cares for you, come with us and live free.""  ",Persuade

Intimidation,"Orderic’s treason made flew in rage. He said nothing, but for a long moment he lingered on the desire to run axe in hand against that Valter, king of rubbish and ragged men instead of fleeing like a rabbit to protect this young arse.Then he sighted, and giving the prisoner a kick he hissed: “Walk, fucked slaver, or I will sell you in Stoniford market as dog meet!”“And you, “ he added speaking to Oredic:“What are you, lad? Are you as cunning as a snake, or do you have found our words so convincing to betray your self-proclaimed King of Rubbish?”“And tell me, right-hand-of-the-king: why should we trust someone who has just confessed he had betrayed his own people? Why should we let you go free and alive after what you’ve said and done?!”He had seized his long hafted axe with both hands, while his eyes were burning with rage.“Speak, now! But be quick, we cannot linger here more than a minute!” ",Awe

Would they trust his offer? could delay the bandits, but then surely the party would have failed to bring the boy back to Beorn. Will the boy be in danger if he returns without his guard? What is the most important case to act on here:1. the attack from Valter on Stoneyford ? 2. or the legal case for one boy, which was Beorn's instruction?

The other two wagons seem to have nearly EXACTLY the same odd fold, the same visible number of crates, and the same visible number of barrels.Jal-beck pushes this loose petal in and downward and there's a lifting of the edge of the third seat plank. It's thinner than the other two forming a shallow box inside of which is a sliver of paper laying atop a doeskin pouch. ""Rose,Take the painted horses from the stable to pull you.Knock on the tavern three times, then leave.Exit through the southern gate. The guard will let you through.""Just as Jal-beck looks up from the note Match comes up the alley on silent steps and whispers.

Perception,"Bree, the alley that runs along the front of the stable behind the tavern is clear. The stables are dimly lit by a few lanterns hung on the stall dividers. It's warm and smells of hay and horse manure. There are five horses. One all black wearing nothing but a fine blanket. Two all brown and two that are splotched white and brown all of which are wearing gear and seem to be ready to go. Jal-beck, you can hear people working behind that door and the smell of cooked food is prominent. Match continues to nervously watch the end of the alley from her new position.**OOC**Each wagon will require two horses. If you're attempting to move stealthily or hide please roll that.  ",Perception
Animal Handling,"""Jal, You said the painted horses.  Those wagons take 2 horses each.  We have 2 paints and 2 browns here already outfitted.  So going with painted only horses, then we are only supposed to take 1 wagon.  If we go by how many horses are ready to go then we should be taking 2 wagons.""""If we go with the paints then I would think we are to take the heaviest wagon as it is the 1 that is different.  If we go with all 4 horses, then do we take the 2 lighter loaded wagons?""Bree tries to grab the bridles on the 2 paints and quietly get them outside.  Thinking these definitely fit the bill.  Cussing to herself the whole time wishing her brother was here as animals love him.

A moment later she whispers to the horses, ""Will you please be calm and pull the wagons?""The paints knicker and one of them sort of nods its head then nuzzles the other. She looks at the browns and asks them the same thing. They both whinny nervously and shift in their spots. She whispers to them again. ""We will, I promise."" She reaches and picks up the reigns. ""They said they don't want to go with us because Jal smells like fire, but they will if we promise them sweet oats, so I did.""Flora salutes and clammers into position in the back of the wagon that Match is driving. Once everyone seems to be in position, Match nods to Jal-bek to let him know she's ready then motions for Drake to climb into the front seat with her. The painted horses even gently pull the wagon out from between the others and start slowly toward the end of the alley away from the marketplace.**OOC**Okay folks, just for a visual reference I made a little map. The marketplace is on the left edge of the map, the stables on the right edge. The tavern is along the bottom edge with the door at K7. This is where Jal-bek is waiting to knock.The Rose wagon is in the middle with Match driving. Flora clammers into the back where she can also hide under the tarp if necessary. I am assuming that Jal-bek attached the brown horses to the wagon on the right, closer to the stables.

Surprise changes their determined expressions as they look up and see the wagon hitched and people in it.

This wagon rode a few inches lower than the others that were found next to The Half-Full Flask back in town. Part of that could be attributed to the weight of what was in the back being heavier than that of the other two.

She has obviously been through some trauma at Tuac’s hands and is confused and unable to think straight. She speaks before she understands what she is saying. It is far more likely that the murderer struck when Tuac was occupied with her. How could she have struck the blow? As you say, where was her blade? And the blows were strong ones. Look at her weak arms. Look how feminine she is. She is no more capable of killing a man of Treve than I am. Look at me. Look how feminine I am. Can you imagine either of us standing up to any warrior in this room? We are women. We are physically weak. Our weapons are the natural charms and virtues of our sex. And as for her protecting the murderer. How does she know him? She is a recently arrived stranger here. I have kept her locked in her rooms day and night. Who then would she have grown fond of? One of you perhaps?” She walks around the room, looking at each man of Treve in turn. “Has one of you been sneaking into her rooms behind my back, hmm? No? Well, of course not. So why would she care about this murderer? Men of Treve - this murder WILL be avenged, but let us not turn on one another.”Romana is hiding her nerves as she tries to salvage the situation.

And no wonder, for they have seen her spend an ahn standing in a locked closet with the other slaves.  Maximus corrects himself: they have seen her standing in a closet with slaves. The Lady is of course not herself a slave. Though he can’t help idly wondering what size ankle and wrist rings she might take. Commonly, shackles come in four sizes, numbered from one (small) to four (large). Slave manacles are commonly curved, hinged bands of black iron, about ¾ of an inch wide and ¼ inch thick. The ankles remain a mystery of course, obscured by the deep folds of her gowns that permit only a slight peep of delicate slipper to emerge from beneath them, but he guesses the wrists would look snug and pretty in a size 2 set of slave bracelets. It is a pleasant thought.  Maximus feels obliged to offer a rousing speech of his own, one that warriors will appreciate.

It may blow sand and dust sometimes, but the deposits are being thinned, trees are in leaf ( a most welcome sight anywhere to any elf) and there is the frequent trickle of water or reflection off a clear pool as they pass. The animals have no difficulty getting water or grass as they plod along. In a conversation  with Zaken on the journey he communicates the idea that he has retained something ominous from that campsite. He also learns of what Zaken experienced at the moment he cast the box into the flames. Neither want to discuss the shadow, nor the sneer from . Somehow he had worked his gag free: now it is regularly checked by the elf. The orc does not seem to relish being touched by Amdir, and glares at him at these times. The elf responds with a smile - that is not a smile - and conceals the fact that the orc thing is repugnant and abhorrent to him.  It would be good to hand this thing over to Thorin Stonehelm for justice: but if the Dwarf Prince does not feel it part of his jurisdiction then they have will have to  escort it all the way back to Dale where King Bard can judge the thing's banditry crimes.The two companions notice that Fletch has gone very quiet and withdrawn. They agree to keep a closer eye on him: he too was in league with the bandits, they do not permit him to carry a weapon an he is never left alone, or asked to stand a watch.They approach Ironthorpe.

The knowledge that she had been summoned here by the highest authority in the city only fed into her anxiety. Arriving at the address she had been given, Heather brushed a few strands of hair out of her face before stepping in. As the ghoul asked for her jacket, Heather just nodded quietly and handed it over. She then quickly straightened her blouse underneath – indubitably the single most expensive piece of clothing, she owned – and made sure her black dress pants were clean, too. Finally, she inspected her hairdo in the reflection in the glass pane of the front door. Caring about her appearance like this wasn’t typical for her, not even in the slightest. However, she had been taught the importance of keeping up appearances when interacting with other Kindred. And even though she didn’t like to pretend, she wanted to be taken as serious as her age would allow. Satisfied with her appearance, She stepped into the main area of the museum. She politely refused the nourishment offered to her – she had just fed last night and pitied the poor souls, who were being offered up like appetizers. Quickly, she stepped away from the entrance area and took a good look around the room to see if she could spot any familiar faces in the crowd. ",perception

Her hand closed into a fist around her hair, and her eyes turned to ice. Slowly, she curled the slaves head upwards while also twisting and pulling back, so that she faced upwards. Whether the slave wanted to move or not was irrelevant; to her it seemed like she was being dragged, lifted, and only came along to prevent her hair from ripping out of her scalp. For a heartbeat Sarah had murder in her eyes. She then continued to twist, craning the slaves neck past the point of comfort.

He glances down at it perplexed and blinks a couple times as he's almost positive that for a moment he saw his porridge bowl through the flesh of his hand. He chuckles to himself thinking his mind must need to catch on to the rest of his body waking up. This unseen business must be making him paranoid. He goes back to sipping his tea.After stopping by the mayor's he asks Bintz to meet him at the library at noon. He heads there to start his own research on matters of curses keeping in mind the substances used for it and trying to discern a possible source. He will also look up anything on the Forest King and the heart of the forest. ",Investigation
Investigation,"Teblin crawls out of bed around noon, eats some rations, and guzzles water from his water-skin. Sitting down on the floor next to his bed, he opens his spellbook and prepares his incantations for the day.About thirty minutes later he finishes his preparations and heads toward the Mastera Library. Once there, he consults Emmerick and attempts to search for similar topics. He also seeks out Yuri to see if he has any advice on how we might defeat this corruption in the forest. ",INVESTIGATION
Nature,"After resting and recovering from their ordeal in the cursed wood, Fyllin goes for a hike. Even though he very much enjoyed the one with Brandt a day or two ago, today he really needed to focus on himself and nature.Once he's outside the gate, he gets off the road as soon as possible. He takes a moment with his eyes closed, before he takes off running. After a few minutes of heavy breathing and sweat, he shakes his hair and flows into the body of a wolf, and keeps running through the forest. He runs and runs, bobbing and weaving around trees, crashing through the underbrush, and splashing through creeks and streams. Eventually, his mind isn't thinking cohesive thoughts, and is just breathing in the nature around him.Sitting down on his haunches on the edge of a clearing, he slows shifts back to his gnome body, sitting cross legged. He listens to the breeze through the branches around him, and feels it brush against his skin. He hears the songbirds, and opens his eyes to see a falcon sitting in a tree across the clearing. He hears rabbits and mice scuttling around. Closing his eyes again, he reaches his hands out and runs them through the grass around him. He digs his fingers into the dirt, and rubs it in his hands.Everything is in balance. Everything has its role. Fyllin thinks back to seeing the energy of life in the forest around him after consuming the leaf that Branch gave him. That energy starts in the earth, and flows though everything.And then there was that Darkness, whatever it was. From what he could tell, Branch and the Forest King worked to preserve the balance, the flow of energy. And then this Darkness came, and corrupted all that. But what was it? He felt the bite of death when it came over him, but was it that simple? Was it death incarnate? Or was it some force that bent the power of death to its will?Fyllin sits at the clearing, watching nature swirl around him, and hoping for inspiration for his questions to come from it. ",Nature

They walk until the seemingly always hungry artificer can stand it no longer.

The undead giant, the fish-men, and now the cursed woods. What if all of this is coming together right here in Rybalka? This town is not prepared for an onslaught like this.

Thankfully, once again, no questions are asked, the uproar ahead being too much of a draw.Thrali peers into the hall. It is a space he knows well, having spent number of his younger years charging these very furnaces. The space is dominated by a central tapering chimney forge carved from the same solid stone as the surrounding walls. An angry orange glow from the chimney's top lights the chamber's domed roof and a dizzying dark bore above for the exhaust gasses. The roar of the furnace mixes with the sound of falling water from the far side of the chamber, water which powers an elaborate system of bellows feeding air through an auxiliary furnace and into the central forge.For a few moments Thrali just stands and admires the pride of Azan.

Insight,"Luckily the round of drinks assist with his introduction, and any reluctance on the part of his audience will slowly be eroded as the ale takes effect. Mention of trading (1) gets a few of the Bree-based locals making enquiries about the fabled wealth of Erebor - with some vague allusions to one very rich hobbit who has passed through Bree once more in the past year it seems - it eases the atmosphere somewhat as the great distance involved strikes the locals with a bit of awe for these hardy travellers: who have made such a great effort 'just to come to Bree'.The small regular mounded hills to the south (2) are quickly named as The Barrows on the Barrow Downs. With ale down the throats of a few, some legends of spirits and bloodsuckers are mentioned, with the usual warning about people who have ventured there but never been seen again, and the 'advice' never to go there after midnight. One, slightly more in his cups than most, Rimba Wheatman, mentions a Wight-King, before he is hushed by a sharp prod from behind. No-one else wants that story.. The topic is quickly moved on by himself to say that the road to the Shire (3) is in good condition for the season.  He was visited just after Yule by five hobbits from Brandy Hall who were out looking for their first wild pheasant hunt of the New Year - a treat for Gorbadoc (Broadbelt) Brandybuck, the lord of Brandy Hall and father of Dodinas and Dinodas, who went east a while back.  His five visiting hobbits (headed by Rory Brandybuck and Rufus Burrows his friend) told him how the road was not damaged by the melted snow at all.The men from Coombe are now lubricated enough to offer information that the village had to beat off two separate raids on some of the outlying houses. On both times the raiders retreated north into the woods called Chetwood.  Herdsmen do not move their animals north of the village at all for foraging currently. there is concern that unless things improve, the south will be over-grazed.  There appears to be no cooperation or help from the Bowmen of Archet, One wife mutters that talk in Coombe is that the men of Archet are in league with the raiders.  (GS gains this extra information)Roll insight to think about this woman's comments, but it is easier to believe that she is simply bad-mouthing the other village rather than reporting a commonly held belief.

Investigation,"Lee thinks over what all she saw during her earlier wanderings about the home, hoping they might shed some extra light upon the --now more important than ever-- question of who is, or what he is, if that is more relevant. She was watching the audience when he started speaking, and was still doing so when he did the --literal-- 'double-speak' stunt, so she gets an idea of just how many of the guests reacted to the deliverance and the strange news. It is really hard to tell which of them are startled or upset by the content of the news, or if they are just creeped out by having someone speak into their minds while bypassing their ears. She knows she is.How did he do that? And to so many people at once! And while continuing with his 'public speaking'! She can't help but be more than a little impressed by what it would take to pull off such a feat. Her Order will want to know details --and they may not be forthcoming with any-- so she needs to work out as much about this magic as she can from what she has here.Lee wracks her brain, trying to put together enough of a idea to get a handle on this.

Lord Hakun - a right haughty git, dismissive of our reports of Orcs in Dale - until we dragged a body in!2. Lord Gunvar - a traitor and terrorist rebel, now locked up in Erebor.

Only if we know where to go to, can we come back with what King Bard desires.  I have limited  awareness  of the area around Dale, so some assistance about the direction to start looking in would be of great help.  You could request Captain to send an officer of his militia with us to guide us and keep us on the right track.""At the same time, Amdir will prompt the other members  of the fellowship to add their offers of help. ",Courtesy
History,"Jofur's last comments show that the courtier has only a vague grasp of life outside the city. No doubt he is a skilled diplomat (perhaps); but he is no traveller. He has clearly listened to many tall tales of how dreadful life is outside the city walls - probably over large meals and many drinks in any of the taverns like the Missing Scale. He probably has no idea of the time it takes to travel (if you are not on roads like the last trip). Amdir has moved up from far to the south. A week's delay is no great amount, unless the scholar was already quite close. This courtier must have had some news more recently about Domi's progress. (Uses Lore to think about the journey - he will have been told of the Blue Mountains when back in Lorien)(after roll: which gives him a good feel for the distances involved) He thinks quickly: with his earlier history he sailed up the Anduin, travelled the elf path across Mirkwood to Laketown - via Thranduil's halls - and then up to Dale, he has now gone on to the Iron Hills and back. It was very much quicker along the road. But, taking a wagon through Mirkwood? Such a story would be all over Wilderland! So this scholar will have gone over the northern route: AROUND the forest. And that has rivers to cross with wagons. Such crossings can take a week even for small caravans: the elves build a carry cradle and swing the wagons across. (A day's work for one wagon.) The wood elves have concealed materials to get wagons and carts across the Forest Stream: and it has long been held that the dwarves have similar: for those in the 'know'. Going around the great forest of the north is more than 150 leagues. (OOC: 500 miles roughly) And the Blue Mountains are at least as far again past the High Pass. No, Jofur is misinformed, or is simply throwing out a wild guess at the travel time.""Let me be frank, Lord Jofur. It is clear to me that the last message about Domi's progress has made you estimate his arrival should have been no more than a week or so back. And the scholar was using a wagon and coming from the west? That makes barely 50 leagues away - at most.  How did the message arrive? Raven perhaps? The birds have long been allies of the men of Dale. So let me deduce this: if birds are your messengers, then birds are your spies too. The dwarf has disappeared hasn't he? Tell us if all of the wagon train he was with has also disappeared? Or has it been attacked? You must know.""Assuming his deductions about the bird messenger system are valid, this logic should oblige the noble to come clean with any more information he has. ",Lore
Intimidation,"Thrali tries to ignore the lingering headache and the sense of unease he has carried with him since the ill-fated night in the storm. The bandying words back and forth between Jofur and the others have made little sense to him. How is it that humans can say so much to each other while making clear that much is left unsaid? There was, however, a tantalizing mention of orcs? Nothing would ease Thrali's troubled mind like the chance to swing his mattock.The interminable, inscrutable talking continues. Thrali's scowl grows with every passing minute. He is mightily relieved when Amdir demands answers.""Yes, I would have plain talk. The Blue Mountains are far removed from my home in the Iron Hills, but its inhabitants are Durin's Folk. If Domi needs our aid, I am eager to render it"" As he speaks, Thrali unhooks his mattock from behind his shoulder and swings it around to lean upon in front of him like a staff.

While understood that not all folk had the fortitude to stand toe to toe with ogres or other hostiles, there was still a crowd, even if many had made for cover. What had begun as a rote, mundane day had transformed into a whirlwind of intrigue and danger, and it was ironic that on the way to the dockmaster’s he had been lamenting his boredom to Kalen.

While Caeldrim and Bellamin discuss their findings and Kal makes his way upstairs, goes behind the bar and grabs the finest wines and whisky he can identify and pours each of his companions a drink. Downing his dram of whisky he pours another, much larger cup.  Turning to regard Santiago and his other compatriots, “I think it’s best if we find a place outside of the city for tonight.” Looking around he drops his voice slightly, it wasn’t overly quiet in the inn but he didn’t want any eaves droppers getting any ideas, “We need to make way for Waterdeep in the morning. We have one resourceful individual after us, I don’t want to add another.” With the deposit, gaining passage by sea would not be out of the question, and would serve to keep ogres from sneaking in the back door as it were.

Bellamin could be a hothead, but he was not known for being one that would go out to instigate a fight with someone.

Time is of the essence; we have nine days to make delivery.” Taking a large drink of whisky, “There are enchantments on this parcel that if attempts are made to circumvent the locks, Lord Baric will know, and rather than us collecting the rest of our 50,000 gold, we will be in the Lord’s debt for 100,000 gold…” leaves this to sink in. Pouring another measure of whisky, it was a good day for the drink, feels it stick in his throat at the mention of drow from Santiago. Forcing it down, the bard remembered stories his father told of the dark elves and their hatred for all surface dwellers, especially surface elves. “I cannot recall any dealings with drow for my part.” Thinking more on the drow situation remembers the strange things he ‘heard’ before the commotion with the ogres. Where the two connected? Standing with Santiago, the half-elf makes an inventory of his gear. “I’m going to collect my things and see to provisioning supplies for the journey. The package we are to deliver are too large for our current mounts, so a wagon may be necessary.” Moving to the stairs, every shudder of the building causing a flinch, “Maybe with the drow situation it would be best for us to make our way to Waterdeep by sea. If we stay close to the shore we should be able to avoid bad weather and pirates. The drow may have power magic working for them, but I don’t imagine there’s much sailing experience in the Underdark.” In his room he noticed that the room was out of order, but nothing jumped out at the bard. With the way that things had gone, still gave his pack and gear a once over. Coming back down stairs and stepping back onto the high road, he looks to Santiago, “I’ll meet you and the others north of the docks.

Perception,"Most would have thought that the noble born half-elf preferred finer establishments, but the Dockside Inn was his kind of place. The proximity to the sea gave the air a heavy, wet feeling and the brine smell of the ocean completed the environmental ambience. Hearing the fellow musicians playing lute and pan pipes helped him to relax a modicum from the days events. The barmaid gets a sly half smile and wink as she leads the group to the table. “Thank you.” While had the reputation for being a cocksman, he was looking for something to distract him from the repeated attempts on their party.  As the innkeeper came to their table, nodded a greeting and was interested by the dwarf’s accent and speech pattern. “I’ll be drinking your finest dwarven spirits.” It had been some time since he had tasted it, but could think back to dwarven fire whiskey, the dwarves said that the secret was the clerics beseeched Moradin’s blessing, but the bard expected that the fermenting tanks were held above the forges that ran night and day.   gave a selection of coins to the dwarf to coax any information he may have, and for his discretion. “Pardon me gentlemen, I must indulge myself.” After taking hold of his lute, the bard approaches the musicians and gets their approval to sit in for a song. explains the gist of the song and after warming up with a few strums begins singing, the notes of the song invoked the feeling of an epic adventure, with a shade of tomfoolery.  “Oh, the dragon's balls were blazin' as I stepped into his cave Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles with a long and shiny blade 'Twas I who fucked the dragon, fuckalizing fuckaloo And if you try to fuck with me, then I shall fuck you too.” The previous residence at the Laughing Gnome would have never been receptive to this ballad, but this inn would find the humor in the song and cheer as the song played.  From where he was playing gave the entrance of the inn an intense once over, looking for signs of nervous folk, or those who might be exuding anxiety.   Thanking the musicians for allowing him to join their set for a song and promising to come back for another song later in the night, the bard returns to his companions ready for food, drink, plotting, and any information the innkeeper may have.

Unfortunately the halfling had a tendency to let his mouth run more often than not, however his fists had always been able to back up the insults that had always sprung forth. Surely he had made a plethora of enemies in his past, but had he offended one enough to pursue him to such reckless ends?((History check))Breaking from his reflections Bellamin recognized a familiar aching in his loins, after Cael placed his order for grub and drink Bellamin added to the order ""Innkeep!

That gave him the idea of composing a song to pay homage to Lady Edelyn, hero of the Battle of Stanshelf, and as a gift to his companions. He based his song on a Gondorian melody traditionally used to celebrate a victory and pay honour to those heroes who sacrificed themselves for the good of their land and the safeness of their companions.The sun was red when they came like a slidedown from the mountains to burn and slaughterthey flooded fields and barns like a black tidethey wanted the Lady to tear asunderThe sun was red when the spears were thrown and like a rain of stars they fell on themwhile the Lady rode against their chieftain aloneher spearhead shone like a red fearful gemThe sun was red like an opening budwhen challenged the vile creatureand watered his sword with its black bloodbut he did not pierce its iron armourThe sun was red like a bloody tearwhen Banog’s mount was woundedbreaking with its fall his horseman’s spearwho, nimble like a bird, with a jump dismountedThe sun was red when ' voice rangclear and bright like a morning starpiercing like an arrow the battle clangmarking foes' hearts with a light scarThe sun was red when the Gondorian swordsglistened high with the same colourReaping heads through the enemy hordesShowing their mastery and their undisputed valourThe sun was mirroring the Lady’s ragewhen she rode towards the fanged monsterwith fierce eyes going on the rampageand lo!
