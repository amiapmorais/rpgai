Perception,"  continued to feed the fire as the evening wore on, and one by one the companions eventually dropped off to sleep.No watch was set that night, for assured them of their safety, and when each awoke refreshed the next day, it was to the sight of their elven companion standing at the mouth of the cave, gazing outwards as the morning sun filtered through the canopy of leaves above.Whether she had slept was not clear, but she greeted them with a hearty welcome, and her keen eyes showed no signs of tiredness.Come, she said, with a merry tone. You have slept long, and it is time for the final part of our journey.  From where we are now, it will take us a day to reach the woods that lie to the south of Imladris. Beyond that is the path we shall follow to the hidden valley. If all goes well, we shall feast in the hall of Elrond Half-Elven in just two days hence.After a quick breakfast, the company mounted their horses, and followed as she led them from the strange wooded sanctuary and back out into the harsh lands that lay between the River Loudwater and the towering peaks of the Misty Mountains. They saw little of note during that day of travel - no hint of the mysterious mist of the previous day, nor any other sign of pursuit - and as the day progressed, the lands around them became greener and more pleasant, with the endless expanse of dry grass and stunted bushes gradually giving way to lightly forested hills.They camped that night amongst the trees, and continued north the next morning, still careful to remain hidden as they travelled, but hopeful now that their journey was almost at an end.By mid afternoon, the companions had left the trees, and found themselves marching across a high moor, where a cold wind hissed noisily through the patches of heather that dotted the hillside. The vast slope climbing towards the mountains was broken by many narrow ravines and gullies, some filled with trees, and other resounding with the crash of falling waters.Their elven companion led them forward with confidence, though she seemed to follow no clear path through the barren lands.OOC: could each of you make an Awareness check please at TN16? is welcome to keep his head down if he wishes to avoid the chance of an Eye. :) ",Awareness

Perception," ""Good to meet you, ,"" the sprite said, flitting sideways for a moment, her rapidly beating wings fairly humming. ""I will move through the woods, scouting for danger... and looking for signs of the evil Celosia and her corpse tree. Which sounds very terrible!""And with that, Dimplebottom speeds off.Sprite ScoutingSo to fully scout the surrounding area, and maybe to find some sign of Celosia, the sprite needs to make three Perception challenge rolls. All three will be with one boon, from the 20+ on the ritual previously. To be sure the immediate surroundings are clear, three successes are needed. If the sprite gets four successes or more, she also finds signs of Celosia and Old Nook. Passing a Perception challenge is worth one success; getting a 20+ is worth two. Any Perception check that fails deals 1d6 damage to the sprite, who has a health of 7. After the three checks she will return. You can then send her out again if you wish, but she'll have to go farther afield to look for Celosia -- and won't have the boon on her Perception checks. Each check takes about 10 minutes of time, so the max number of checks she can make is 6. All that make sense?

We have only now left the Captain Elstan: it seems that he is now aware of your real position. Although any casual citizen might think he is looking into your reported demise, he has left many of the avenues of enquiry open to us. I am proud to say that we have been delving deep into those avenues with some information that we will aly before you for your valued judgements.First of all, however, may I offer you our continued services, and express our pleasure that you are in good health. "" (bows with a sweep of his arm across his chest, taking off his hood to complete the civilised greeting.) (OOC: although a Courtesy roll might be added here, it seems unnecessary as everyone knows everyone - can roll it if required)""First to report, concerning your own report of the people who were involved with the boat attack on the road back from Ashbrook. The boat itself was of Dorwinion make: but we are not too sure that means anything as it was stolen from an upright citizen of Dale - Gwion the music seller.  The real thing about the boat is that it is of course a little colourful  and distinctive for most members of Dale so it is more easily remembered.  One of our contacts (Katun, an easterling merchant) knew of the boat and put us on to Gwion. She also knows him and can vouch for him.  We then went to speak to people working at the docks, and of course to Gwion.Secondly, then, we learnt that after the attack the boat was attempted to be destroyed. Your attackers did not do an effective job there either! When the boat was discovered and reported, the Reeve had the owner traced. So when Gwion arrived he found his intended pleasure boat in a poor state- but repairable. Gwion has passed on a letter found in the wreck - this letter.."" (passes note to ) ""..of course we have also asked Thrun about it. He and I agree it is in a style that dwarves would write, the language is the Common, and refers to a 'passage in preparation'. If this is correct then something sounds to be imminent!We have some more to tell: your lordship will no doubt remember that we were told  by the Harbour Reeve (Halward) that some people had been seen around Gwion's boat - and they were talking to people wearing uniforms of red.    This brings us to our third piece of news: Thrun and Donar both know of three possible Nobles who employ servants in red livery. Lord Bryni of Strandburg, Lord Gunvar of Ashbrook - that would be not too far from where you were attacked we would like to note - and the third noble is that well known Dwarf-hater, Thegn Osgar of the withered arm. About these three: We have at least two accounts that suggest Lord Bryni is a most unlikely member of the conspiracy: his servants think him a fool and getting to be vain and a spendthrift. His actions are simple: and observations by Milo here, ..."" (points to the hobbit, who seems to be almost asleep, but actually is nibbling an apple he has found in his pocket) "".. show Bryni to be a very inactive person, concerned only with shopping and eating. We think him to be a low concern, and  a fop, like his servants.Thegn Osgar is interesting: at first, the most bitter, and the one who it is easy to believe would enjoy the  enmity between Dwarves  that we rescued Thrun from. But we have learnt that he is  a man of honour. He would have to join with the Miners iof the Iron Hills  in their disputes with the merchants and FingerCraft Dwarves in Dale, in order to be at the back of the argument in the Market. He would have to act against his principles to do that - he has publicly stated he will never back a Dwarven enterprise until they have finished rebuilding both Dale and Esgaroth: and at no charge! (Well THAT is not going to happen!) Frankly, even if he backed one of the two sides, he would have said so in open council. Instead, we understand that he has always opposed all Dwarf activity in Dale; but he has done this publicly and within the law. No, we do not suspect him or his men.I leave our other noble to last. The Lord Gunvar has no obvious evidence directly against him. Well, none that we have uncovered in the last day or so! However, careful examination of the events of the past few days reveal (1) he was around the market when Thrun was abused and we had to stop a fight - he was 'buying toys', but we saw no evidence of it. (2) He is Lord of Ashbrook - and you had been sent in that direction when you were attacked (3) he has been involved in 'plots' before - this is no other than Captain Elstan's knowledge, and if he has not been caught yet, then he is careful enough not to be caught yet. Gunvar is our main suspect; but we have yet to find any dwarf he is linked to: either in Erebor, Dale or even the Iron Hills. I assume that you are intimate with the dealings of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain and of King Dain - bless his beard and boots! -, but is there anyone in Dale who is the emissary of the Iron Hills in this city? And do you know them? We could look any office over. "" ",Courtesy

""Thissh will take mosht of the night. To do properly, musst take our time. I'll take the blood firsht - that won't hurt, I'm very gentle. Then replace with sssssome blood I have brought."" He can't help but lick his lips talking about blood so much. ""It will help the processss of integrating your new bonesss.""He opens a bag to show the implants. There are over a hundred small bone spines, like thick needles. ""I'll put you to sleep for the resht, thhhat part will hurt. I'll need to attachhh each of thessse to your own bones in the palmsss of your handsss and sssholesss of your fffeet.""   The process is he takes your blood, then gives you new blood thats supposed to help, then knocks you out and pokes long tiny bones into your hands and feet. It sounds shady, but he really does look very clean for a ghoul. Everyone else gets some sleep and the kobolds watch out for anything shadier than you signed up for.He'll make a Medicine check and you'll make a Con save and hopefully they're both good. 1 baseline level of exhaustion, and 16 DC to not get any more, on each check.

Fascinating…” Lorraine explains before looking over the blade in closer detail suddenly unaware of the battlefield surrounding her.As everyone gets a chance to head back and work with Lorraine, you noticed that she has in fact been very busy,  having taken the parts from an assortment of the collected light-crossbows in order to construct what looks like a small walking light crossbow. The item is in fact an arbalester, a form of artificer construct companion. It moves over to Lorraine from the back of the wagon as if equally fascinated by the blade Lorraine was excited about. ",Spot
Perception," The worst of the journey seems to have been put behind you. As you all gather what remains of the belongings you look to the path ahead. You divide up what you see needs to go to who from the treasure you found (Make sure to discuss who is getting what. I know  wishes to get the Cloak of Resistance if no-one else has any interest in it!) and begin to make your journey to the Mouth of the Whitehearth Mine.The journey alone will be a short one, and having still the remainder of the day left you can rest assured you have made great strides to get ahead of the both the Blood of Vol and the Emerald Claw, let alone any other forces that may have attempted to take pursuit.You all are made aware of your pursuer, as the same bird had been following you since the Jade Quarry. The Bird's intentions are still not yet known, but for the bird to follow for so long without taking a rest hints at an unnatural origin.Meanwhile you all turn your attention to the path ahead:Light: Having arrived at what would normally be just before dusk, the Mournland is bathed in the darkness of a cloud-covered night (total cover for mundane and low-light senses). You all will need to determine how to provide light to those who don't have darkvision!Sound: The area around the mineshaft is deathly quiet. A successful DC 20 Listen check allows...a PC to hear the occasional rustle of the nearby vulture zombie’s skeletal wings.At the base of a low hill, a timbered opening leads into a dark tunnel. At first glance, it looks like any other abandoned mineshaft. Then, with a more careful inspection of the opening, you spot the House Cannith seal emblazoned on the center crossbeam. Lorraine is able to verify that there are no traps or alarms are present at the entrance, with the tunnel stretching into a deeper darkness ahead (total cover for mundane and low-light senses; Get ready for a Dungeon Crawl! SET UP YOUR MARCHING ORDER and decide on how you want to handle the approaching bird!). ",Listen

Survival," Undertakings- All: through your combined efforts, Rivendell will be opened as a Sanctuary. The main benefit (aside from getting to spend future Fellowship Phases there) is being able to find it with just a straight Travel roll! (you needed Aiwiel last time).- : a song - great stuff!- : another song - excellent! Now we need to remember to sing them...Can each of you please narrate your songwriting efforts? - : great roll (GS) for your Researching Lore Undertaking. Can you narrate your research efforts, and I’ll follow up with what you discover? - : how about “Guard the Last Bridge”?  I’m sure the elves patrol the road between Rivendell and the Last Bridge, perhaps with the help of the Dúnedain - I’ll let you take some artistic license. And as you suggest, let’s just use the same table as for “Guard the East Road”.  Go ahead and roll/narrate.Also: - Jamie: I like your idea of having begin his dwarven smithing in Rivendell. I do think that his creation should be finished in the forges of Erebor though. We can work out the timing details later. Happy to preempt this with some RP with Damron if you wish.Is that everything?  What have I forgotten? ",Travel

Survival," OOC: All members of a fellowship have to  agree to make the place they are staying at during a Fellowship Phase into a new sanctuary. Usually this permits the group to automatically return and stay without having to be re-introduced etc). In Rivendell it means that we will still need a successful Travel Roll to return to Rivendell. (Normally, we would need to be guided there like Elrond's escorts for Irime did this time.)  Imagine trying to get back here - we would remain lost in this part of the world if we did not know the clues to find the Hidden Valley.   Lost and exposed to the dangers of this region - and Baldor would know all about the Trollshaws....Personally I think we should do this, as then we have somewhere to go in this otherwise empty and lonely land. It would mean we could come back and confer with the folk of Rivendell on a different occasion, and rest before we went back to Wilderland. If we just leave Rivendell after a rest, then we will not be able to return without help.(other than that can only try to  reduce some Shadow.)  ",Travel
Investigation,"  gazed into the cave, trying to determine just how far the darkness before him went on.He removed his backpack, and pulled out one of the crude torches that he had fashioned in the forest when they came upon the spider webs. ’s impromptu web-fire had meant that the torches never got used, and had simply packed them into his bag in case they were ever needed.And now it seemed they were...Leaving his backpack and shield  (and handing the Roadwarden’s Staff to ), he lit the brand and began to walk cautiously into the darkness, hoping that his journey would not last long.OOC: let me know if an Explore or Search roll is needed.

Perception," The familiar change in the chamber one last time for the blue key, revealing a corridor that is illuminated by weakened everybright lanterns (only providing shadowy illumination).Any PC who makes a successful DC 15 Listen check can hear... splashing water and indistinct yaps and growls from area W10.This corridor of plain gray stone extends ahead of you all. In the flickering light from the dim everbright lanterns embedded in the walls, you see a few trails of crusted blood running along the floor, as if someone was dragged down the corridor. At the far end of the hall you see three portals: an open archway to the left, a door propped open straight ahead, and a sealed metal door to the right. ",Listen
